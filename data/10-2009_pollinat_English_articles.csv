The reproduction barrier caused by Kr genes decreases hybrid seed set; however, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. We attempted to localize the QTLs controlling the crossability of wheat in wheat-rye crosses by using molecular markers on wheat chromosome 5B on which the most effective Kr gene is known to be located. QTL mapping was carried out using the F7 population derived from a cross between Chinese Spring (high crossability) and a chromosome substitution line of Chinese Spring which has its chromosome 5B of Cheyenne (low crossability), and pollinated with rye cv. Petkus. In this population, a major QTL region controlling crossability with rye was detected on the locus closely linked to a SSR marker, Xgwm443, on the short arm of chromosome 5B which was supposed to be Skr locus.",Crossability; Krl; QTL mapping; Reproduction barrier; SKr; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72549113061

CL in barley is controlled either by the single, multi-allelic gene cly1 located on the long arm of chromosome 2H, or by two closely linked, epistatic genes (cly1 and Cly2). Here, we have taken advantage of the co-linearity which exists between chromosome 2H of barley and rice chromosome 4 to generate de novo markers targeted to the CL region, and these have been used to construct a localized high resolution genetic map. While synteny is largely conserved in this region, the critical 18 cM barley segment appears to be inverted with respect to the equivalent 1.6 Mb physical stretch of the rice genome. The cly1 locus was located in a 0.76 cM region of barley genetic map, and rice orthologue of cly1 (if there is one) is one of the 11 genes predicted to lie within 90 kb interval of rice genome.",Comparative genetic mapping; High resolution map; Synteny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72549100586

GISH discriminated St, H and Y genomes, indicating that E. nutans has retained its ancestral genome, and large chromosomal rearrangements have not occurred. However, FISH using an AGG satellite and Afa-family repetitive sequences, revealed marked variation in the signalling patterns of most of the chromosomes. Many of the plants carried chromosomes with a specific pattern in the homozygous state, indicating that self-pollination or sib-crossing occurs in small populations during selection for domestication.

Fourier, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble, France","Background. Mutualisms are inherently conflictual as one partner always benefits from reducing the costs imposed by the other. Despite the widespread recognition that mutualisms are essentially reciprocal exploitation, there are few documented examples of traits that limit the costs of mutualism. In plant/seed-eating pollinator interactions the only mechanisms reported so far are those specific to one particular system, such as the selective abortion of over-exploited fruits. Results. This study shows that plant chemical defence against developing larvae constitutes another partner sanction mechanism in nursery mutualisms. It documents the chemical defence used by globeflower Trollius europaeus L. (Ranunculaceae) against the seed-eating larvae of six pollinating species of the genus Chiastocheta Pokorny (Anthomyiidae). The correlative field study carried out shows that the severity of damage caused by Chiastocheta larvae to globeflower fruits is linked to the accumulation in the carpel walls of a C-glycosyl-flavone (adonivernith), which reduces the larval seed predation ability per damaged carpel. The different Chiastocheta species do not exploit the fruit in the same way and their interaction with the plant chemical defence is variable, both in terms of induction intensity and larval sensitivity to adonivernith. Conclusion. Adonivernith accumulation and larval predation intensity appear to be both the reciprocal cause and effect. Adonivernith not only constitutes an effective chemical means of partner control, but may also play a key role in the sympatric diversification of the Chiastocheta genus. © 2009 Ibanez et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72449206717

A total of 53 queens of B. eximius and 37 queens of B. sonani were collected in the field during 2007 and 2008. B. eximius has a longer period for colony initiation, immature stages in each caste, and a larger colony size (63-271 workers) than B. sonani (21-68 workers). Under the laboratory conditions, queens of B. eximius laid 4-6 eggs in each eggcup, while B. sonani laid 2-3 eggs. The queen production point (QP) of B. eximius started before the switch point (SP), and the queen production eggs were laid in Phase 3. However, queen production eggs of B. sonani were probably laid during the Phase 2 and Phase 3. It was found that B. eximius has a longer period of colony development than B. sonani, and the main difference between the two species was the number of third worker brood during Phase 3. In the field, the endemic species B. sonani is considered to adapt to the temperate climate, while B. eximius is adapted to the subtropical climate in Taiwan. The colony development and seasonal occurrence of B. eximius is expected to be from September/October to April or later, and from April to August or later in B. sonani. The results showed no differences between the two species in the queen nesting rate, successful colonization rate, successful mating rate of laboratory-reared queens, and egg laying rate of laboratory-reared queens. We strongly suggest that B. eximius has great merit for pollination programs of commercial utilization, while B. sonani can only serve as a substitute species for pollinations in Taiwan.

Although postulated to help attract insect pollinators, the function, chemical nature, and ontogeny of these surface nanostructures remain uncertain. Studies have been hampered by the fact that no ridgeless mutants have been identified. Here,wedescribe two mutants lacking nanoridges and define the biosynthetic pathway for 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate, a major cutin monomer in nature. Using gene expression profiling, two candidates for the formation of floral cutin were identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana: the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 6 (GPAT6) and a member of a cytochrome P450 family with unknown biological function (CYP77A6). Plants carrying null mutations in either gene produced petals with no nanoridges and no cuticle could be observed by either scanning or transmission electron microscopy. A strong reduction in cutin content was found in flowers of both mutants. In planta overexpression suggested GPAT6 preferentially uses palmitate derivatives in cutin synthesis. Comparison of cutin monomer profiles in knockouts for CYP77A6 and the fatty acid ?-hydroxylase CYP86A4 provided genetic evidence that CYP77A6 is an in-chain hydroxylase acting subsequently to CYP86A4 in the synthesis of 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate. Biochemical activity of CYP77A6 was demonstrated by production of dihydroxypalmitates from 16-hydroxypalmitate, using CYP77A6-expressing yeast microsomes. These results define the biosynthetic pathway for an abundant and widespread monomer of the cutin polyester, show that the morphology of floral surfaces depends on the synthesis of cutin, and identify target genes to investigate the function of nanoridges in flower biology.","10,16-dihydroxypalmitic acid; Cuticular ridges; CYP77A6; CYP86A4; Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 6",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76049100034

A total of 122 sequences from 18 populations were randomly sampled and analyzed in this study. Results showed that nucleotide variation was generally high within populations, and differentiation was very low among populations. Genetic diversity was slightly reduced in samples taken from the area with a recent strong reduction in population size. Nevertheless, the allele frequency spectrum was skewed toward rare variants, and the association among variants of different sites was significantly more nonrandom within these samples compared with those from the area without such a population size reduction.

Tendrils and inflorescences have a common origin known as anlage or uncommitted primordia. The fate of the uncommitted primordia depends on the cytokinin-gibberellin balance, with cytokinins promoting transition to flowering and gibberellins inhibiting it. High temperature and high light are induction stimuli for flowering. Neither photoperiod nor vernalization is very relevant for flowering induction. Inflorescence primordia development in latent buds stops after the formation of secondary and tertiary branches, approximately one month before shoot periderm formation. Buds resume growth after dormancy, with further branching of inflorescences before differentiation of individual flowers. Warm weather at budburst favors further inflorescence differentiation, resulting in more clusters per shoot, while cool weather favors differentiation of more flowers per clusters and fewer clusters per shoot. Environment and cultural practices influence flowering, either directly or indirectly via their impact on photosynthesis and nutrient availability. Cultural practices encouraging light penetration into the canopy favor flower initiation, while practices resulting in shading have a detrimental impact. Flower formation occurs through a series of sequential steps under hormone-mediated genetic control. The first genetic change involves the switch from the vegetative to the floral state, in response to different environmental and developmental signals, through the activity of floral-meristem identity genes. Second, the floral meristem is patterned into the whorls of organ primordia through the activity of floral-organ identity genes. Third, the floral-organ identity genes activate downstream effectors that specify the various tissues which constitute the different floral structures. The flowers are hermaphroditic and most are self-pollinated but cross-pollination also occurs. Fertilization is hindered by cool rainy weather and favored by warm dry weather. © 2009 by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture.",Carbohydrates; Genetic control; Growth regulators; Nutrition; Variability; Water relations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049164167

We asked whether defenses can originate by exaptation from preexisting pollinator attractants, or vice versa, whether plant defenses show escalation, and if so, whether by enhancing one line of defense or by adding new lines of defense. Two major patterns emerged: (i) correlated evolution of several complementary lines of defense of flowers, seeds, and leaves, and (ii) 5 to 6 losses of the resin reward, followed by redeployment of resin for defense of male flowers in 3 to 4 lineages, apparently in response to herbivore-mediated selection for defense of staminate flowers upon relaxation of pollinator-mediated selection on resin. In all cases, redeployment of resin involved reversion to the inferred ancestral arrangement of flowers and resiniferous bractlets. Triterpene resin has also been deployed for defense of leaves and developing seeds. Other unique defenses against florivores include nocturnal closure of large involucral bracts around receptive flowers and permanent closure around developing fruits (until opening again upon dehiscence). Escalation in one major clade occurred through an early dramatic increase in the number of lines of defense and in the other major clade by more limited increases throughout the group's evolution. We conclude that preaptations played important roles in the evolution of unique defense and attraction systems, and that the evolution of interactions with herbivores can be influenced by adaptations for pollination, and vice versa.",Floral resin; Florivory; Plant defense; Resin defense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70849085203

In North Mediterranean conditions two tomato crop cycles can be carried out in the same year. Environmental constraints limiting pollination in the cycles may impose the use of different pollination techniques, both from the productive and from the economical point of view. The aim of this study is to analyze whether flower vibration, bumblebee pollination, or auxin spraying, improve fruit production of early and late tomato greenhouse crops. Treatments were more effective in the early crop, carried out in spring, than in the late one in summerautumn. For both crop cycles, the highest production was for the bumblebee pollinated plants. The mechanical flower vibration technique and the auxin treatment significantly increased production in the early crop, but they were ineffective in the late cycle crop. However, treating the early crop with auxins may result in nipple-shape fruits. Earliness was not affected by the treatments. Fruit set was improved by all treatments tested and in both crop cycles. In both seasons, the use of bumblebees was the most successful treatment, and the maximum effectiveness was observed during the periods of low night temperatures in the early cycle, when fruit set was limited due to impaired production of viable pollen and/or poor pollen release. Auxin and vibration enhancement of fruit set was higher for the early than for the late crop cycle. The environmental conditions were determinant for the effectiveness of the treatments. Moreover, the bumblebee efficiency was demonstrated not only when the climatic factors were limiting for tomato fruit set, but also when fruit-set was not limited by natural climatic conditions. © Verlag Eugen Ulmer KG, Stuttgart.",Auxins; Bumblebees; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mechanical vibrator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70749098362

Male-biased frequencies were observed in the eusocial bees and in some of the non-social bees, probably because they are sensitive to the larger male floral rewards. A pollinator introduction experiment confirmed that male-biased, unbiased and infrequent non-social bees can pollinate R. trichocarpa, indicating that non-social bees can contribute to fruit set. The results suggest that there are likely to be two different functional groups of generalist pollinators: (i) the majority of the pollinators may contribute to reproductive success through unbiased and occasional visits; and (ii) a minority group of eusocial bees may contribute to reproductive success through male-biased visits. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Dioecy; Floral display size; Generalist pollinator; Rhus trichocarpa; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049140816

Phylogenetically, Aristolochiaceae represent the first angiosperm lineage that developed trap flowers. Here we report the structure and function of specific trichomes contributing to the highly specialized trapping devices. Investigations were carried out on six Mediterranean Aristolochia species. The morphology and arrangement of the trapping trichomes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM. To demonstrate frictional anisotropy of the trapping trichome array, a microtribological approach was used. The results of our experiments support a hypothesis long proposed, but never tested, regarding the trapping mechanism in proterogynous Aristolochia flowers: that an array of highly specialized trichomes arranged eccentrically to the underlying surface is responsible for the easy entrance of insects into flowers but impedes their escape. As they enter the male stage of anthesis, flowers significantly modify their inner surface characteristics, allowing insects to leave. We have demonstrated the substantial contribution of trapping trichomes to the capture, retention and release of pollinators, an important prerequisite for making cross-pollination possible in most Aristolochia species. Finally, we compare trapping trichomes of Aristolochia with similar structures found in other trapping flowers as well as in pitchers of carnivorous plants not optimized for insect release. © 2009 New Phytologist.",Aristolochia; Biomechanics; Crystalline wax; Flower biology; Force measurements; Pitfall flower; Trapping trichome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449363964

Examination of young inflorescence meristems revealed that G. diffusa ray florets develop (and probably also initiate) basipetally, in the opposite direction to the disc florets-a developmental phenomenon that has been found in some other daisies, but which contradicts conventional theories of daisy inflorescence architecture. Using these ontogenetic and morphological data, we have identified the mechanism by which G. diffusa patterns its insect-mimicking petal spots, and we propose a testable model for the genetic regulation of petal spot identity.",Asteraceae; Development; Epidermal cell; Floral evolution; Gorteria diffusa; Micromorphology; Petal spot; Phyllotaxy; South africa; Trichome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71449083286

Here, we analysed mating patterns of the wind-pollinated dioecious shrub Pistacia lentiscus by genotyping 904 seeds from 30 mother plants with eight microsatellite markers in a high-density population in two consecutive flowering seasons. We found significant differences in some mating system estimates between years, particularly in the levels of correlated paternity. Overall, within-mothers correlated paternity was higher in 2007 than in 2006 (rpWM = 0.085 and 0.030), which translated into an effective number of fathers (Nep) of 11.8 and 33.6 respectively. Using a smoothing interpolation technique, we show that the effective pollen cloud was spatially structured in patches of high- and low-genetic diversity, which do not remain constant from year to year. In 2006, the among-mothers correlated paternity (rpAM) showed no trend with distance, suggesting no restriction of pollen dispersal. However, in 2007, rpAM was greater than zero at short distances, revealing the existence of small-scale patterns of pollen dispersal. The fact that the studied seasons were climatically homogeneous during the flowering time suggested that the observed differences might be ascribed to between-year phenological variation of individuals in the studied population or other (unknown) factors. Numerical simulations, based on the real data set, indicated that the clumping of males and decreasing plant density, which is related to different types of pollen limitation, greatly increase correlated mating in this wind-pollinated species, which is of relevance under the frame of the continuous anthropogenic habitat disturbance suffered by Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Correlated paternity; Mating system; Pistacia lentiscus; Spatial variation; Temporal variation; Wind-pollinated species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71549137201

To test this, we analyzed a data set collected from five field sites near Strausberg, Germany, which included information on flower color and months of blooming. However, we chose to consider flower color as perceived by bee as well as human visual systems, as well as independent of any color vision system, to reveal whether trends, if present, have any ecological relevance. Using randomization analyses, we were able to consider whether blooming time interacts with flower color, and how this interaction depends upon other factors. Our results show that there is an association between the months of flowering and the colors of flowers-but only when flowers are considered according to human color categories. Further analysis showed that this is merely a consequence of flowers from the same family being more likely to flower at the same time and have similar colors. All these effects disappeared when flowers were considered using bee color categories, and in the analyses of physical spectral reflectances. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",Bee vision; Color space; Flower pigment; Pollination syndrome; Sensory ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049174102

AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom","Background and AimsIn the UK, the flowers of fruit-bearing hedgerow plants provide a succession of pollen and nectar for flower-visiting insects for much of the year. The fruits of hedgerow plants are a source of winter food for frugivorous birds on farmland. It is unclear whether recent declines in pollinator populations are likely to threaten fruit-set and hence food supply for birds. The present study investigates the pollination biology of five common hedgerow plants: blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), dog rose (Rosa canina), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and ivy (Hedera helix).MethodsThe requirement for insect pollination was investigated initially by excluding insects from flowers by using mesh bags and comparing immature and mature fruit-set with those of open-pollinated flowers. Those plants that showed a requirement for insect pollination were then tested to compare fruit-set under two additional pollination service scenarios: (1) reduced pollination, with insects excluded from flowers bagged for part of the flowering period, and (2) supplemental pollination, with flowers hand cross-pollinated to test for pollen limitation.Key ResultsThe proportions of flowers setting fruit in blackthorn, hawthorn and ivy were significantly reduced when insects were excluded from flowers by using mesh bags, whereas fruit-set in bramble and dog rose were unaffected. Restricting the exposure of flowers to pollinators had no significant effect on fruit-set. However, blackthorn and hawthorn were found to be pollen-limited, suggesting that the pollination service was inadequate in the study area.ConclusionsEnsuring strong populations of insect pollinators may be essential to guarantee a winter fruit supply for birds in UK hedgerows.",Blackthorn; Bramble; Crataegus monogyna; Frugivorous birds; Hawthorn; Hedera helix; Hedgerows; Insect pollination; Ivy; Prunus spinosa; Rosa canina; Rubus fruticosus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73149125155

Three treatments were imposed on O. syriacum plants before flowering: 1) Plants were left uncovered to permit insect visiting, 2) plants were covered and hand pollinated with pollen from flowers of other plants, and 3) plants were covered (control). The results showed that 21 bee species were identified visiting O. syriacum flowers, of which 8 species were recorded for the first time in Jordan. Supplementary pollination produced a higher significant number of seeds and seed set than other pollination treatments that led us to conclude that O. syriacum flowers are affected by pollen shortage under natural conditions. Wind plays little or no role in its pollination process. There is low seed yield production and seed set by O. syriacum under natural conditions in Jordan.

Like predator-prey interactions, many mutualisms are also consumer-resource interactions. However, no studies have explored how the structure of plant-pollinator networks may be affected by nutrient enrichment. For three years, we enriched plots of subalpine plant communities with nitrogen and observed subsequent effects on plant-pollinator network structure. Although nitrogen enrichment affects floral abundance and rates of pollinator visitation, we found no effects of nitrogen enrichment on the core group of generalist plants and pollinators or on plant-pollinator network structure parameters, such as network topology (the identity and frequency of interactions) and the degree of nestedness. However, individual plant and pollinator taxa were packed into the nested networks differently among nitrogen treatments. In particular, pollinators visited different numbers and types of plants in the nested networks, suggesting weak, widespread effects of nitrogen addition on individual taxa. Independent of nitrogen enrichment, there were large interannual differences in network structure and interactions, due to species turnover among years and flexibility in interacting with new partners. These data suggest that the community structure of small-scale mutualistic networks may be relatively robust to short-term bottom-up changes in the resource supply, but sensitive to variation in the opportunistic behavior and turnover of plant and pollinator species among years. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049169587

In addition, flowers hand-pollinated and isolated with sodium alginate produced progeny that were 100% outcrossed with the applied pollen. The exclusion bags, on the other hand, were not as effective in protecting the stigma as seed was produced in those treatments that were isolated with an exclusion bag without being handpollinated.

The actual mechanisms by which pollinators could drive species diversification in plants are not fully understood. However, it is thought that pollinator host specialization can influence the evolution of reproductive isolation among plant populations because the pollinator's choice of host is what determines patterns of gene flow in its host plant, and host choice may also have important consequences on pollinator and host fitness (Grant 1949; Bawa 1992). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Smith et al. (2009) present a very interesting study that addresses how host specialization affects pollinator fitness and patterns of gene flow in a plant host. Several aspects of this study match elements of a seminal mathematical model of plant-pollinator codivergence (Kiester et al. 1984) suggesting that reciprocal selection for matched plant and pollinator reproductive traits may lead to speciation in the host and its pollinator when there is strong host specialization and a pattern of geographic subdivision. Smith et al.'s study represents an important step to fill the gap in our understanding of how reciprocal selection may lead to speciation in coevolved plant-pollinator mutualisms. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Coevolution; Host specificity; Phenotype matching; Population differentiation; Yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71549123431

For H. portoricensis, which bears flowers with typical outcrossing morphology, the results from 322 h of direct observations and videotaping showed that visits to flowers by animals were uncommon. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that H. portoricensis has a partially self-compatible breeding system that it is not autogamous and thus requires an external mechanism for the movement of pollen to set fruit. We detected differences in seed size, seed mass, germination success, and multiplicative fitness estimates between self-and cross-pollination treatments. We found that progeny resulting from natural and self-pollination treatments showed signs of inbreeding depression compared with progeny resulting from cross-pollination; however, the magnitude of the inbreeding depression was less than 50%.

Volume decomposition and machinable volumes (MVs) or machining features determination is the core activity in process planning. This process requires extraction of elementary volumes (EVs), merging or clustering EVs to construct feasible MVs and finally selecting an optimal combination of MVs. Development of MVs is an important activity, so that better solution is obtained by better developed MVs. Generation of limited number of MVs or machining features, which is often performed by experts may miss the optimal solution. Also, using exact methods such as combinatorial optimization not only generate infeasible MVs, but also require an excessive amount of computational time. In this research, the meta-heuristic procedure of flower pollinating by artificial bees (FPAB) is used in manufacturing context to generate and assess the feasibility of MVs. Furthermore, a set-covering method is used to select the optimal solution. The performance of the proposed model is assessed through some numerical examples.

One issue is whether pollinator specialization, traditionally thought necessary for floral isolation, is prevalent enough to have played a major role in speciation. Furthermore, the ecological and geographic scenarios under which pollinator transitions occur are poorly understood, and the underlying genetic factors are just beginning to be uncovered for a few systems. Nevertheless, macroevolutionary studies consistently show that transitions to animal pollination are accompanied by an increase in diversification rate. Here we consider several models and diverse empirical data on how pollinators could influence speciation. We conclude that floral isolation is rarely, if ever, sufficient to cause speciation on its own, but that it acts synergistically with other isolating mechanisms. A more comprehensive approach is the key to an improved understanding of the role of pollinators in angiosperm speciation. Copyright © 2009 by Annual Reviews.

Controlled pollination experiments were carried out in an orchard located in Songkhla province, southern Thailand, from February to July 2003. Floral longevity, stigma receptivity, and pollen viability were examined before carrying out the experiments. Three pollination treatments were compared: open pollination, manual pollination with bags, and bags without pollination (apogamy). Although there was no significant difference in the initial fruit set, bagged and manual pollination produced a significantly greater fruit drop rate than apogamy or natural pollination at one week after the flowers had been pollinated. On the other hand, the apogamy treatment had a greater fruit drop rate than natural and manual pollination treatments before fruit maturation. In addition, unpollinated bagged flowers bore fewer and smaller fruit than naturally and manually cross-pollinated flowers. Although the fruits from unpollinated flowers were capable of asexual seed formation, they produced fewer seeds and had poorer seed quality (defined as average fresh weight and germination rate) than those from the other treatments. The occurrence of asexual and sexual reproduction was also studied using Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and by comparing the patterns of bands produced from DNA extracted from the offspring of the naturally cross-pollinated fruits. On average, 58% of the offspring had a genetic constitution identical to that of the maternal parent (ranging from 36% to 87%), indicating that some offspring were produced without prior fertilisation. However, the remainder showed polymorphism, demonstrating the occurrence of sexual reproduction. These findings indicate that facultative apomixis occurred in the study population.

However, studies on plant reproductive response to variation in population size that simultaneously consider different interactions are rare. In this study, we examined (1) how levels of pollinator visitation and florivory vary with population size of a self-incompatible herb, Verbascum nigrum (Scrophulariaceae), (2) the relative effect of these two interactions on host seed set, and (3) whether the intensity of florivory influences pollinator visitation rate. The intensity of florivory increased, whereas pollinator visitation rate decreased with host population size. Although average seed production was negatively affected by the intensity of florivory, seed production was independent of population size. The direct negative effect of florivores on plant seed set was indirectly enforced by their negative effect on pollinator visitation rate.

The temporal dynamics and formation of plant-pollinator networks are difficult to study as it requires detailed observations of how the networks change over time. Understanding the temporal dynamics might provide insight into sustainability and robustness of the networks and how they react to environmental changes, such as global warming. Here we study an Arctic plant-pollinator network in two consecutive years using a simple mathematical model and describe the temporal dynamics (daily assembly and disassembly of links) by random mechanisms. Results. We develop a mathematical model with parameters governed by the probabilities for entering, leaving and making connections in the network and demonstrate that A. The dynamics is described by very similar parameters in both years despite a strong turnover in the composition of the pollinator community and different climate conditions, B. There is a drastic change in the temporal behaviour a few days before the end of the season in both years. This change leads to the collapse of the network and does not correlate with weather parameters, C. We estimate that the number of available pollinator species is about 80 species of which 75-80% are observed in each year, D. The network does not reach an equilibrium state (as defined by our model) before the collapse set in and the season is over. Conclusion. We have shown that the temporal dynamics of an Arctic plant-pollinator network can be described by a simple mathematical model and that the model allows us to draw biologically interesting conclusions. Our model makes it possible to investigate how the network topology changes with changes in parameter values and might provide means to study the effect of climate on plant-pollinator networks. © 2009 Pradal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74049091808

The genetic basis of floral traits is a key factor in determining the evolutionary response to pollinator-mediated selection. Despite the important role of genetic background in evolutionary studies, it has rarely been incorporated into pollination studies. Extensive literature on the reciprocal effect of pollinators and floral traits on each other exists, yet only a few studies tested the effect of molecular genetic variation of pollination-relevant floral traits on pollinator behavior. Here, I review these studies and propose a framework to study pollinator-mediated selection in an evolutionary genetic context.Two lines of research are used to study the genetic basis of pollination. The first approach connects candidate genes for floral traits with pollinator behavior. These genes can be modified, and the consequent reaction of the pollinators' behavior is then observed. The second approach uses indirect estimation of the genetic effect by constructing the genetic architecture that underlies floral characteristics, and quantifying its indirect effect on pollinator behavior and consequent measured fitness.

The big flower opens in the morning with its three stigmas standing erect, far from the five stamens. Honeybees visit a flower at this stage, usually collect all the pollen, and perform poor pollination. At noon, when the stigmas have bent over and lie closer to the anthers, the bees ignore these flowers. Hand pollination doubles yield rates and produces larger fruits, but it is expensive. A passionfruit plot was covered by an insect-proof net-house and honeybee hives were placed in a nearby open field. Opening the net for honeybee visitation at noon directed the bees to visit the flowers at the optimal time for efficient pollination. Pollination by these ""directed hoenybees"" produced more than twice the fruit set of hand pollination, with a similar fruit size. Both net-house bumblebee pollination and open-field honeybee pollination yielded 2.5-fold less than hand pollination, and the latter yielded smaller fruits. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",Apis mellifera; Daily flowering course; Directed honeybees; Passiflora edulis; Pollination behavior; Pollination efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049158403

Cheating of pollinators by plants has provoked controversy among evolutionary biologists since Darwin, who argued that it was impossible to evolve. Here I review the patterns and stability of cheating of pollinators by plants, focusing on the Orchidaceae. Review of current phylogenetic and character state evidence in selected clades of the Orchidaceae supported the hypothesis that cheating is ancestral to those clades, while mutualism has evolved repeatedly from cheating. No evidence is found for instability of cheating clades compared to mutualistic clades over evolutionary time, nor that pollinator generalization is associated with mutualism. I argue that to understand the stability of cheating within pollination mutualisms, cheating should be considered as a frequency-dependent process, suggest analogies between the evolution of cheating and exaggerated sexual traits in male animals, and suggest critical experiments that will elucidate how and why mutualism evolves. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049183064

The aim of the study was to determine relationships between phenological behaviour (flowering) of olive trees and the air temperature trend (1982-2007) in the Umbria region. The phenological data on flowering phase were registered indirectly through an aerobiological monitoring technique. The obtained results showed a strong relationship between phenology and thermal trend. This characteristic was confirmed from results of correlations between temperature (mean temperature from 1st March) and flowering dates, especially that of full flowering (r = -0.9297). Moreover, the results showed an advance trend of 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively of start, full and end of flowering dates. The advance of the recorded flowering time in this period is to ascribe mainly to the increase of mean temperature and above all to that registered in months of May and June. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Climate change; Italy; Olea europaea; Phenology; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350593693

The high diversity of ornamentation type in pollen grains of angiosperms has often been suggested to be linked to diversity in pollination systems. It is commonly stated that smooth pollen grains are associated with wind or water pollination while sculptured pollen grains are associated with biotic pollination. We tested the statistical significance of an association between pollen ornamentation and pollination system in two families of the monocotyledons, the Araceae and the Arecaceae, taking into account the phylogenetic framework. Findings. Character optimization was carried out with the Maximum Parsimony method and two different methods of comparative analysis were used: the Concentrated-Change test and the Discrete method. The ancestral ornamentation in Araceae is foveolate/reticulate. It is probably the same in Arecaceae. The ancestral flowers of Araceae were pollinated by beetles while ancestral pollination in Arecaceae is equivocal. A correlation between ornamentation type and pollination was highlighted in Araceae although the results slightly differ depending on the method and the options chosen for performing the analyses. No correlation was found in palms. Conclusion. In this study, we show that the relationships between the ornamentation type and the pollination system depend on the family and hence vary among taxonomic groups. We also show that the method chosen may strongly influence the results. © 2009 Sannier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77049108498

The relative dominance of this family in the honey bee genome is suggestive of a role in processing phytochemicals encountered by honey bees in their relatively unusual diet of honey (comprising concentrated processed nectar of many plant species) and bee bread (a mixture of honey and pollen from many plant species). In this study, quercetin was initially suggested as a shared substrate for CYP6AS1, CYP6AS3, and CYP6AS4, by its presence in honey, extracts of which induce transcription of these three genes, and by in silico substrate predictions based on a molecular model of CYP6AS3. Biochemical assays with heterologously expressed CYP6AS1, CYP6AS3, CYP6AS4 and CYP6AS10 enzymes subsequently confirmed their activity toward this substrate. CYP6AS1, CYP6AS3, CYP6AS4 and CYP6AS10 metabolize quercetin at rates of 0.5 ± 0.1, 0.5 ± 0.1, 0.2 ± 0.1, and 0.2 ± 0.1 pmol quercetin/ pmol P450/min, respectively. Substrate dockings and sequence alignments revealed that the positively charged amino acids His107 and Lys217 and the carbonyl group of the backbone between Leu302 and Ala303 are essential for quercetin orientation in the CYP6AS3 catalytic site and its efficient metabolism. Multiple replacements in the catalytic site of CYP6AS4 and CYP6AS10 and repositioning of the quercetin molecule likely account for the lower metabolic activities of CYP6AS4 and CYP6AS10 compared to CYP6AS1 and CYP6AS3. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Commelina benghalensis L., an andromonoecious rainy season weed, bears male and bisexual flowers in axillary spathes of all the plants investigated. Bisexual flowers are of two types; chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL). The former are borne on subaerial and the latter on subterranean shoots, in addition to those on aerial spathes. Three populations of the species, designated JU1, JU2 and JU3, were scanned for three consecutive years from 1996 to 1998, and the number and distribution of male, CH and CL flowers per plant were found to vary. The mere number of CH/CL flowers per plant is by itself not an accurate measure of mixed mating. It is necessary to confirm that CH flowers actually outcross and, if they do so, to what extent. Comparison of the pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio and percentage pollen germination on the stigmas of the CH and CL flowers have been used as indices of the pollination system. Confirmation of this was sought from the fruit and seed sets obtained after manual pollination of emasculated flowers with self- and cross-pollen. Results so obtained were compared with those of natural pollination. In the majority of CH flowers, the male and female reproductive phases (i.e. anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity) overlap, providing for self-pollination. However, two exceptions to this general behaviour were found in some plants of all the three populations. In some CH flowers, the female phase matures prior to anther dehiscence while in others, the anthers are sterile.

Ontogeny of mature angiosperms begins with an embryo that is formed after tip growth by a pollen tube delivers the sperm nucleus to the egg. Because of the importance to plant fitness, we have investigated how gravity affects these early stages of reproductive development. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants were grown for 13 days prior to being transferred to growth chambers attached to a large diameter rotor, where they were continuously exposed to 2-g or 4-g for the subsequent 11 days. Plants began flowering 1 day after start of the treatments, producing hundreds of flowers for analysis of reproductive development. At 4-g, Arabidopsis flowers self-pollinated normally but did not produce seeds, thus derailing the entire life cycle. Pollen viability and stigma esterase activity were not compromised by hypergravity; however, the growth of pollen tubes into the stigmas was curtailed at 4-g. In vitro pollen germination assays showed that 4-g average tube length was less than half that for 1-g controls. Closely related Brassica rapa L., which produces seeds at 4-g, required forces in excess of 6-g to slow in vitro tube growth to half that at 1-g. The results explain why seed production is absent in Arabidopsis at 4-g and point to species differences with regard to the g-sensitivity of pollen tube growth. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Arabidopsis; Gravity; Hypergravity; Pollination; Reproduction; Tip growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73949092195

Flowers generatecolour by refl ecting only a subset of the wavelengths which make up white light, resulting in a coloured appearance.This is achieved either through the use of chemical pigments which absorb certain wavelengths, or by the use of structures which refl ect only certain wavelengths. Chemical colour has been well studied in plants, andthe three major pigment groups are fl avonoids, carotenoids and betalains. Spatial and temporal regulation ofthe synthesis of these pigments gives pattern and depth of colour to the fl ower. Combinations of pigments canresult in variations in fi nal fl ower colour, while the addition of metal ions and the alteration of cell pH can alsoinfl uence the fi nal wavelengths absorbed by pigments. Focussing light into the pigment-containing regions ofthe cell, using specialised cell shapes, also infl uences intensity of fl ower colour. Structural colour, including iridescence, is produced independently of pigment colour, and can overlay it. Flower colour itself is viewed as an advertisement to attract pollinating animals to the rewards (usually nectar) contained within the fl ower.

This study investigates the psychophysics of honeybee perception when individual honeybees are presented with a choice of a known non-rewarding color that is perceptually similar to a previously rewarding (but not present) target color, or a novel color. In experiment one, bees were tested for color preferences to three different artificial ""blue"" flowers, two of which were very similar in color; there was no color preference for any of the stimuli. In a second experiment, bees were provided with absolute conditioning to one of the perceptually similar stimuli. In subsequent non-rewarded tests these bees could not discriminate between the similar colors but could discriminate the non-similar color. In a third experiment, bees provided with differential conditioning (target rewarded and distractor unrewarded) learned to reliably discriminate between the perceptually similar stimuli. Surprisingly, when these bees were presented with a task of choosing between the known non-rewarding flower and a novel flower, bees chose the non-rewarding flower. The finding reveals that there is a strong perceptual effect on bees to choose stimuli that are perceptually similar to known rewarding flowers. The results explain how non-rewarding floral mimics may gain sufficient pollinator visits to enable pollination. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",Batesian; Decision; Mimicry; Model; Psychophysics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049158734

The great majority grow in the ground layer of the rain forest (e.g., Cyrtandra and Henckelia species) or are epiphytes (e.g., Aeschynanthus) or climbers (e.g., Agalmyla), while others are mostly restricted to limestone (e.g., Chirita, Monophyllaea and Paraboea). Two life strategies are seen in the family: deep-shade rainforest species (e.g., Henckelia platypus) are slow-growing, live for up to 20 years but their seedlings are rarely seen. In contrast, limestone species produce copious seedlings, are fast-growing, early flowering and short-lived, most succumb to drought and are annuals, Monophyllaea horsfieldii is slightly longer lived but dies when its hypocotyl can no longer support the lamina. Common ways of extending the life span of the individual is the decumbent stem, or in monocarpic species by producing sprouts from the stem base, or rarely from leaf cuttings. Flowering patterns includes continuous, gregarious or seasonal flowering. Observations on pollination are lacking; flower visitors observed include birds for Aeschynanthus, bees for Henckelia species, butterflies for Monophyllaea. Self-pollination may occur in some species. Seed dispersal is probably by wind (e.g., Aeschynanthus and some Paraboea) and by ballistic force of water drops from the forest canopy (e.g., Epithema, Henckelia).

The effect of climate during the full flowering period (FFP) in respect to G. avellana seeding behavior was studied from 1999 to 2008, using several clone selections. Average nut yield was 23.5 ± 8.2 kg per year, and annual yield variability was significantly and highly positively correlated with mean daily temperature, and significantly and negatively correlated with total rainfall and wind speed during the FFP. As G. avellana is a self-infertile species which needs cross pollination to form fruits, the climate during this period is likely to have firstly an effect over the intensity of the bees pollination and secondly, therefore, over the subsequent nut yield. Thus, despite some compensation between the crop load and the nut size, there is an overall effect from FFP climate on final NIS yield. This in turn broadly defines the total kernel and oil yield, being the ultimate main commercial objective due to its nutritional and phytotherapeutic properties. The climate during the FFP can exert a great influence on annual nut yield variability. These results are important in understanding the productive behavior of Gevuina, and are useful as selection criteria for its improvement program and for a proper orchard management.",Crop yield; Flowering climate; Gevuina avellana; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75449093050

Genetic diversity analysis using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicated that the cultivar Gemlik is the major olive cultivar grown in this region, while other olive cultivars are grown only for use as pollinators of Gemlik or for growers' own exotic consumption. Although the quality of Gemlik is widely accepted in Turkey, its tendency toward alternate bearing is a major drawback. Twenty-four genotypes were selected within the cultivar Gemlik because of their tolerance to alternate bearing. These selected genotypes have the same SSR alleles as Gemlik, making them good candidates for developing a Gemlik olive with reduced alternate bearing. About 8% of samples did not share the same SSR alleles with Gemlik, though these genotypes were identified as Gemlik by the growers. Some other standard cultivars that are grown in other regions of Turkey were mistakenly called Gemlik in this region, probably due to the popularity of this cultivar in the southern Marmara region.

Because many ant species have been observed collecting the seeds, this interaction is often described as a generalized mutualism. Here, we combine fieldwork and meta-analyses to test this assumption. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Aphaenogaster ants (predominantly A. rudis) collect approximately 74±26% (mean±SD) of the myrmecochorous seeds in eastern North American forests where any encounters with Aphaenogaster were reported, and approximately 61±37% of the seeds in all the eastern forests where any seed collection has been monitored. This remarkable monopolization of seeds is due to at least two factors: 1) Aphaenogaster are significantly more likely to collect the ant-adapted seeds they discover than are ten other ant genera found in these forests and 2) the densities of Aphaenogaster and myrmecochorous plants are positively correlated at three nested spatial scales (within 20×20 × m patches, among patches within a forest, and among 41 forests in the eastern United States). Although other ants can collect seeds, our analyses demonstrate that A. rudis is the primary seed dispersal vector for most of this rich temperate ant-dispersed flora. The low levels of plant partner diversity for myrmecochores demonstrated here rivals that of tropical ant-plants (myrmecophytes) and well exceeds that typically observed in temperate plant-frugivore and plant-pollinator mutualisms and myrmecochory in other biomes. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049152327

The study was conducted in the Judean Foothills, a region with a Mediterranean ecosystem in central Israel, during almond bloom in 2008. We sampled bees and blooming plants in natural habitats, almond orchards, a weedy orchard (where wild flowers had been allowed to grow), and the margin between orchard and natural habitat. The margin and natural habitats had a significantly higher abundance of wild bees compared to the orchard, while the weedy orchard showed intermediate abundances. No significant differences were found among habitats in the number of wild bee genera, but there were significant differences in genera composition between the natural and orchard habitats. Honeybees were the main bee visitor to almond flowers. Nevertheless, the diverse and abundant wild bee community surrounding the orchards warrants further investigation of their role as almond pollinators. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",Almond; Biodiversity conservation; Ecosystem service; Pollination; Wild bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049172476

Because O. cornifrons has a short adult life span, synchronization of bee emergence with bloom is critical to maximize crop pollination. This study was conducted to determine lower temperature thresholds (LTDs), optimum temperatures, and required degree-day accumulation for emergence of O. cornifrons adults. Patterns of temperature-dependent emergence of O. cornifrons adults at seven temperatures (3.9, 12.0, 18.6, 26.6, 30.3, 35.6, and 42.5°C) were modeled and simulated with linear and nonlinear regression analyses. Results of this study showed that required degree-days (DD) for emergence of male and female O. cornifrons adults were 125.2 DD, with LTD of 8.9°C and 179.8 DD, with LTD of 8.6°C, respectively. The optimum temperatures for emergence were 36.5, 30.2, and 35.7°C for male, female, and both sexes combined, respectively.

This work is among the first to study the mating system of a gypsophyte, Helianthemum squamatum (Cistaceae), which is a short-lived perennial endemic to gypsum habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. We carried out a hand-pollination experiment, considering the following pollination treatments: autogamy, geitonogamy, xenogamy and control (open-pollination). Generalized linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the fruit set and the number of viable seeds yielded per fruit. Both response variables were significantly higher in the xenogamy treatment than in the autogamy and geitonogamy treatments. No significant differences were detected between the xenogamy treatment and the control group, indicating that H. squamatum is mainly an outcrosser although partially self-compatible. Our results also suggest that pollen limitation may only slightly affect the reproductive success of H. squamatum. In contrast with the general tendency towards self-compatibility previously described in short-lived species of the Cistaceae, this outcrossing mating system resembles the one of long-lived perennials © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 2008.",Gypsophyte; Hand-pollination experiments; Mating systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67549129309

It resulted in an increased interest for breeding fast-growing hardwoods in short rotations. Although common alder is not so productive in short rotations as some willows and poplars, insufficient development of the biomass market and increased awareness for conservation of domestic forest tree species, makes it favorable for raising plantations as it is the indigenous forest tree species that can be grown in longer rotations, if needed. The estimate of above-ground dry biomass per tree (trunk and branches up to 7 cm in diameter) as well as production of biomass per hectare was made in 4 experimental plantations. The research included two mixed plantations of common alder open-pollinated families with willow clones (Salix sp.) and two pure common alder plantations. Experimental plantations, aged 14 and 16 years, are located in two different sites. The estimated family mean values for dry biomass varied between 12.5 and 70.9 kg per tree. The results showed considerable differences between families as well as between different silvicultural treatments. The estimated production of the common alder dry biomass varied between 27.4 and 87.5 t/ha with mean annual increments (MAI) between 1.9 and 6.3 t ha-1 year -1 was shown that willow clones have a negative influence on the alder biomass in mixed plantations, at the studied plantation age. Willow clones have shown greater biomass production, compared with common alder, in spite the fact that its planting density was far lower. Although the planting density of common alder trees was lower compared to other studies, the average biomass production is within the framework of other results, which indicates significant potential of biomass production in local conditions. The additive variance was not statistically significant for the biomass trait, which was probably caused by the dominant influence of microenvironmental factors (weed, game) during the growth, but also by a small number of studied families. Statistically significant interactions of investigated families with silvicultural treatments and sites have been shown, which directs to the genetically caused differences in the adaptability of families on studied site and growth differences.",Genetic test; Genotype × environment interactions; Open-pollinated families; Variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149172111

Individuals may vary in their genetic load because of different selfing histories, which could lead to differences in inbreeding depression among families. Lineage-dependent inbreeding depression can appear in gynodioecious species if obligatory outcrossed females are more likely to produce female offspring and if partially selfing hermaphrodites are more likely to produce hermaphrodites. We investigated inbreeding depression at the zygote, seed, and germination stages in the gynomonoecious-gynodioecious Dianthus sylvestris, including pure-sexed plants and a mixed morph. We performed hand-pollinations on 56 plants, belonging to the three morphs, each receiving 2-3 cross treatments (out-, sib- and self-pollination) on multiple flowers. Effects of cross treatments varied among stages and influenced seed provisioning, with sibling competition mainly occurring within outcrossed fruits. We found significant inbreeding depression for seed mass and germination and cumulative early inbreeding depression varied greatly among families. Among sex morphs, we found that females and hermaphrodites differed in biparental inbreeding depression, whereas uniparental was similar for all. Significant inbreeding depression levels may play a role in female maintenance in this species, and individual variation in association with sex-lineages proclivity is discussed.",Biparental inbreeding; Caryophyllaceae; Dianthus sylvestris; Female advantage; Germination rates; Gynomonoecy-gynodioecy; Inbreeding depression; Maternal investment; Seed mass; Seed number; Sibling competition; Uniparental inbreeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71449094970

Calceolaria is a highly diversified genus of these areas, representing one of the most specialized plant - pollinator systems because flowers produce nonvolatile oils, a very unusual floral reward. Phylogenetic analyses with molecular (ITS and matK) and morphological characters from 103 Calceolaria species were conducted to examine relationships, to understand biogeographic patterns, and to detect evolutionary patterns of floral and ecological characters. Total evidence analysis retrieved three major clades, which strongly correspond to the three previously recognized subgenera, although only subgenus Rosula was retrieved as a monophyletic group. A single historical event explains the expansion from the southern to central Andes, while different parallel evolutionary lines show a northward expansion from the central to northern Andes across the Huancabamba Deflection, an important geographical barrier in northern Peru. Polyploidy, acquisition of elaiophores, and a nototribic pollination mechanism are key aspects of the evolutionary history of Calceolaria. Pollination interactions were more frequently established with Centris than with Chalepogenus oil-collecting bee species.

One such distribution is the ideal free distribution, where consumer density matches local resource density. Alternatively, if wing wear is an important cost of wing use for bees, there should be relatively more bee consumers in high density patches, resulting in ""overmatching"". If the energetic costs of flight influence patch choice, there also should be relatively more consumers in high density patches (where flight costs are lower), resulting in ""overmatching"". To examine these hypotheses, I observed the visitation of bumble bees (genus Bombus) across experimental manipulations of plant density in patches of bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) in southwest Alberta, Canada over 2 summers. Bees flew more often and for a greater proportion of time, and hit their wings more frequently, in low-density patches. In 2004, bees ""undermatched"" resources (relatively few bees in high density patches). In 2005, bees achieved an ideal free distribution. Overall, wing wear and energy costs alone cannot explain bumble bee use of their floral resources (in either year), while the ideal free distribution sometimes can (i.e., in 2005). This study therefore complements the findings of ideal free distributions in other aspects of the foraging ecology of pollinators.",Bombus; Foraging behaviour; Ideal free distribution; Resource tracking; Undermatching; Wing wear,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749100293

The pre-dispersal inbreeding depression was estimated as 0·502 based on the difference in seed set per flower between self- and cross-pollinated flowers. Selfing rates of differently sized clones did not differ.ConclusionsIt is concluded that in A. kusnezoffii the negative effects of self-pollination causing reduced female fertility with clone size arise primarily from a strong early-acting inbreeding depression leading to the abortion of selfed embryos prior to seed maturation.",Aconitum kusnezoffii; Clone size; Early-acting inbreeding depression; Female reproductive success; Geitonogamy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73149125785

We examined the breeding system of this rare species, and observed visitors to its flowers, as part of a larger effort to document its status and facilitate its recovery. MethodsReproductively mature experimental plants were grown from seed collected from wild plants in two of the largest remaining populations. Controlled hand pollinations on potted plants were conducted to determine the level of compatibility of the species and to investigate compatibility within and between populations. Seeds from the hand pollinations were planted in soil, and they were monitored individually, recording time to seed germination (cotyledon emergence). Wild plants were observed in several of the remaining populations to determine which species visited the flowers.Key ResultsHand pollination and seed planting experiments indicate that J. reclinata has a mixed mating system: flowers are able to set fruit with viable seeds with self-pollen, but outcross pollen produces significantly greater fruit and seed set than self-pollen (?50 for crosses vs. <25 for self-pollinations). Visitors included a wide array of insect species, primarily of the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. All visitors captured and examined carried J. reclinata pollen, and usually several other types of pollen.ConclusionsRemnant populations of beach clustervine will have greater reproductive success not only if floral visitor populations are maintained, but also if movement of either pollen or seed takes place between populations.

Therefore, flowers may cheat by not producing nectar and may still get pollinated. Earlier studies supported this 'cheater flower' hypothesis and suggested that the cost saving by cheater flowers could be the most predominant selective force in the evolution of nectarless flowers. Previous models as well as empirical studies have addressed the problem of optimizing the proportion of nectarless and nectarful flowers. However, there has been no attempt to optimize the investment in nectar production along with that in floral display. One of the key questions that arises is whether the floral display will evolve to be an honest indicator of nectar reward. We use a mathematical model to co-optimize the investments in nectar and floral display in order to achieve maximum reproductive success. The model assumes that pollinators rely on a relative rather than an absolute judgement of reward.

Because pollinator declines associated with land use change have been reported across the globe, there is great concern that pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide will be negatively affected. This study examines the diversity and abundance of bee pollinators in grasslands in Boulder County, Colorado, USA. Over five years, 5,200 bees were collected in grassland plots with different levels of urbanization. Most of the difference in species composition among three levels of urbanization was due to rare species that may not have been discovered in all plots. Neither the number of species nor their abundance differed significantly among the plot types, although the trend indicated increasing diversity with increasing distance from urbanization. Most notably, measures of urbanization, such as the amount of pavement and development, were not correlated with diversity. The most important factor affecting bee abundance, particularly for ground-nesting bees, was grazing regime. Bee abundance also was positively related to the number of flowering plant species. Other studies of different insects (grasshoppers and butterflies) in these plots showed results similar to ours. In contrast, previous studies on song-birds, raptors, and rodents showed significant differences between urban edge and remote plots in terms of organism abundance and diversity. Together, these results suggest that factors other than the degree of urbanization are important in determining insect abundance and diversity.",Bee abundance; Bee diversity; Grasslands; Grazing; Insects; Pollinators; Urbanization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049164744

Branch cluster frequency (BR) scores are useful for ranking families, but do not give absolute mean internode length or internode index values. Also, comparing BR scores across different sites is complicated by large differences among site means and variances. It is desirable for the breeder to characterise families for mean internode length. Using a laser to measure internode length is potentially more precise and faster than other methods (e.g. climbing, height pole, and PhotoMARVL). We address the potential of a new laser technique to: (1) estimate genetic parameters of mean internode length and internode index; (2) quantify the relationship between BR and mean internode length; and (3) determine the optimum zone of stem for characterising whole-tree mean internode length. Fifty open-pollinated families, ca 20 trees/family, were assessed at two sites, one on the Kaingaroa Plateau, and the other on Northland coastal dunes (Pouto), 38 families being common to both sites. Mean internode length of the first log (MIL1) and second log (MIL2), mean internode length in the 4-7 m height zone (MIL4-7 m), and internode index of the first log (IIX1) and second log (IIX2) were assessed at age 17-18 years using a laser. These measurements were compared with previously collected data (diameter at breast height over bark and BR scores) from an age 8 assessment of the trees. On average, MIL2 exceeded MIL1 (0.51 cm and 0.40 cm respectively at Kaingaroa; 0.38 cm and 0.35 cm respectively at Pouto). Across-sites narrow-sense heritability (h2) estimates of BR, MIL1, MIL2, IIX1 and IIX2 were 0.18, 0.25, 0.23, 0.26 and 0.27 respectively, approximately half the within-site estimates. Across-sites genetic correlation estimates for these traits were ca 0.45, further indicating considerable rank-change genotype-environment interaction. Mean internode length in the 4-7 m height zone had higher estimated h2 than BR, and a high genetic correlation (about 0.98) with BR, indicating that laser assessment could be made more cost-efficient by assessing MIL4-7 m, which might be used to compare the families for mean internode length at different sites. To convert BR scores to obtain a reliable site mean for mean internode length, 30 random trees from each BR score class could suffice at a given site. © 2009 New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited, trading as Scion.",Branching pattern; Genetic correlation; Genotype × site interaction; Heritability; Internode index; Pinus radiata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75649091465

Evaluations of this monitoring data combined with relevant measures of anthropogenic activity can aide in interpreting emerging patterns of bee pollinators. In 1972, we sampled bees visiting flowers of a population of the leguminous tree, Andira inermis (W. Wright) DC in a dry forest site adjacent to the town of Liberia, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Slightly more than 800 bees were recorded on the average per tree site, with an overall bee diversity among the trees of approximately 70 species. Standardized bee samples were taken again from the same population of A. inermis in 1996, 1999, and 2004. In each of these years average abundance level per tree was greatly reduced, as was overall species diversity. Andira inermis trees were also observed to have variable attraction for large anthophorid bees versus honey bees. Some trees attracted significantly more anthophorids than honey bees, whereas other trees attracted the opposite. Since 1972 there were many changes in land use that were directly related to a rapidly growing human population in Liberia. These changes, which greatly modified the natural landscape and vegetation, are believed to have caused a major decline in species diversity and abundance of bees to a low but consistent level. Concurrently, increased urban growth has resulted in many more residential neighborhoods that have a wide variety of ornamental flowering plant species, many of which are native to Costa Rica, that attract a wide variety of native bee species. Evidence is offered to suggest that urban residential areas represent a source of bees that continue to visit A. inermis at low levels in and immediately around Liberia. © 2009 Kansas Entomological Society.",Bee pollination; Deforestation; Long-term monitoring; Solitary bees; Tropical dry forest; Urban ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77749328251

Here, we model coevolution between mutualist and exploiter birth rates, using an obligate pollinating seed parasite mutualism associated with a nonpollinating exploiter as a reference system. In this system, mutualist and exploiter larvae parasitize the host plant, competing for and consuming seeds. Evolution of the mutualist determines which exploiters can invade successfully. Subsequent coevolution with an exploiter has a strong, predictable influence on mutualist-exploiter coexistence, mutualist and exploiter phenotypes, and species abundances. Weak mutualist competition promotes ""evolutionary purging"" of the exploiter, while weak exploiter competition leads to ""evolutionary suicide"" of the system. When stable, long-term coexistence occurs, we identify two main ""trait-abundance syndromes"" that have three novel implications. (1) Persistent, highly parasitic exploiters can be favored by coevolution. (2) Even then, the density of coevolved mutualists can be high. (3) Low plant density results primarily from the evolution of mutualist, not exploiter, birth rate and density. To evaluate these predictions, studies are needed that identify and compare populations with and without exploiters and compare life-history traits of mutualists and exploiters. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Adaptive dynamics; Coevolution; Coexistence; Competition; Exploitation; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72449168521

These flag-like bracts contrast in color with the leaves below them, and are oriented perpendicular to the flowers on the inflorescence. We studied how color contrast and perpendicular orientation affect the feeding choices of bumblebees in laboratory experiments. We trained bees to feeders with perpendicular two-color displays, and subsequently recorded their choices among feeders that displayed only one of these cues. The bees preferred perpendicular displays that resembled the training model in the color of the horizontal component. We then evaluated the effects of the horizontal vs. vertical display component on foraging choices. After training bees to two-color, perpendicular displays, we allowed them to choose between displays with either the same horizontal or the same vertical component as the training model. Foragers mostly oriented to the horizontal displays to which they had been trained. We conclude that (a) bumblebees learn perpendicular, two-color displays; (b) horizontal display components influence foraging choices more than vertical components; (c) vertical visual cues might guide the approach to a feeder, serving as landmarks.

The main objective of this research was to determine self-fertility rate and blooming phenology of 25 commercial cherry (P. avium L.) cultivars in Iran. This study was conducted during 2006-2007. Results revealed that the stage of bud swell in all cultivars began late second decade of March, which lasts 8-11 days. In all cultivars the duration end bloom to petal fall stage took 5 days. Cherry cultivars were classified into three groups considering their overlapping pollination. The cultivars each group had a great overlapped pollination toward each other. The results also showed that there was a significant difference among cultivars in respect of the fruit set (P < 1%). The fruit set of open pollination treatment among the cultivars varied in range of 7.36-41.58%. However fruit set was not observed in isolated pollination (artificial and natural self-pollination). In open pollination, the cultivars were also classified into four groups, i.e. weak fertility (Moreau and Ferracida), mean fertility (Siah Mashhad, Napelon, Proteva, Haj usefy, Lambert, Roshun, Sefid Ghermeze Baghno, Arak, Belamarka, Siah Shabestar, Ghermeze Rezaeyeh, Abardeh, Soraty Lavisan and Victoria), good fertility (Peshrase Mashhad, Dovoumras Mashhad, Bing, Shesheiy Mashhad, Siah Ghazvin and Sefid Rezaeyeh), very good fertility (Zarde Daneshkadeh, Dirrase Italia and No. 1 karaj).

Consequently, integrated pest management is necessary for this crop as chemical control is often required to avoid production losses. Among pollinators found on cotton, Apis mellifera is one of the most important, as it can increase cotton production 20-30%. On the other hand, selectivity is an important characteristic of insecticides, as it makes it possible to lessen impacts on pollinators and other non-target organisms. We examined the toxicity of various insecticides for honey bees foraging on cotton in a greenhouse, including Turbine ® 500 WG (150 g ha-1) (flonicamid), Actara ® 250 WG (200 g ha-1) (thiamethoxam), Cartap ® 500 SP (1500 g ha-1) (cartap), Talstar ® 100 CE (1000 mL ha-1) (bifenthrin) and Match ® 50 CE (1000 mL ha-1) (lufenuron). Applications of Talstar®, Actara® and Cartap® were quite toxic. Talstar® was the most deadly, while Match CE ® and Turbine® were only slightly toxic for adult honey bees. The Match CE® treatment mortality was similar to that of the control; thus, we classified it as innocuous for A. mellifera adults.",Environmental impact; Non-target effects; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953101463

Thus, land management practices can influence density-dependent demographic parameters and species interactions. We investigated plant-pollinator interactions and reproduction in Prosopis flexuosa, the largest tree species in the Central Monte desert of Argentina, an important economic and cultural resource for humans and a functionally prominent species. We hypothesized that reproductive output of P. flexuosa would be limited at low densities, and that exclusion of catle grazing would enhance population density and consequently interaction frequency with pollinators and reproductive success. The study was conducted in and around Ñacuñán Biosphere Reserve (Mendoza, Argentina), where cattle grazing has been excluded for over 35 years. Working in five pairs of protected and cattle grazed 1-ha plots, we recorded density of adult trees, pollinator visitation frequency to inflorescences and seeds per inflorescence in focal trees. Adult tree density was higher in protected plots than in cattle grazed plots. Density of reproductive trees was positively correlated with seed production, suggesting positive density dependence for reproduction (Allee effect). Pollinator visitation to inflorescences and seed production was higher in protected plots compared with plots under cattle grazing. Suppression of anthropogenic degradation has resulted in higher adult tree density in protected plots, indirectly higher pollinator visitation to inflorescences and higher reproductive success of trees. Increased frequency of plant-pollinator interactions and tree reproduction suggest success of management practices aimed at protecting P. flexuosa woodlands. © 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",Allee effect; Monte Desert; Pollination; Prosopis flexuosa; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450227201

An extra phase was introduced to RRS just after the second cycle of selection where outstanding dura derived from (DA3D × DA5D) combinations of the second cycle were self-pollinated for seed production. Best palms based on the phenotype were selected and crossed with pisifera of second cycle offspring of LM2T. [(DA3D × DA5D) self-pollinated × LM2T self-pollinated] progenies were field tested at La Dibamba (Cameroun) from 1987 to 1997. They were precocious with regard to the three-first years' bunch yields (13.16-15.77 t/ha). Homogeneity for all bunch yield components and homogeneity for vertical growth were illustrated by low values of the variation coefficient (5.75-7.75%). The oil yield was 107% of the control against 115% from [(DA3D × DA5D) × LM2T self-pollinated] progenies of the second cycle of RRS, mostly due to poor mesocarp to fruit and poor oil to mesocarp ratios which led to a low oil extraction rate. The extra selection phase led mainly to homogenisation of progenies but also reduced the fruit quality. However, three progenies whose average oil yield represented 115% of the control (4.87 t/ha) in addition to their precocity can be released to oil palm growers. The extension of RRS did not fully meet expectations and poses the problem of its reliability. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Inbreeding depression; La Dibamba; Oil palm; Reciprocal recurrent selection; Self-pollination; Yield components,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76149125140

Mathematical models of coevolution in obligate pollination mutualisms suggest that phenotype matching between plants and their pollinators can generate reproductive isolation. Here, we test this hypothesis using a natural experiment that examines the role of natural selection on phenotype matching between yuccas and yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) in mediating reproductive isolation between two varieties of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia var. brevifolia and Y. brevifolia var. jaegeriana). Using passive monitoring techniques, DNA barcoding, microsatellite DNA genotyping, and sibship reconstruction, we track host specificity and the fitness consequences of host choice in a zone of sympatry. We show that the two moth species differ in their degree of host specificity and that oviposition on a foreign host plant results in the production of fewer offspring. This difference in host specificity between the two moth species mirrors patterns of chloroplast introgression from west to east between host varieties, suggesting that natural selection acting on pollinator phenotypes mediates gene flow and reproductive isolation between Joshua-tree varieties. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Coevolution; Gene flow; Host specificity; Microsatellite markers; Mutualisms; Pollination; Sibship reconstruction; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71549120780

Its value for assessing fertility and ploidy level was assessed in British Sorbus L. Aims: To assess variation in pollen stainability within and between Sorbus taxa, and its relationship to ploidy level. Methods: Stainability of pollen was examined in herbarium specimens using Alexander's Stain. Results: The diploid species (S. aria, S. aucuparia, S. torminalis) have the highest pollen stainability, followed by tetraploids (S. croceocarpa, S. devoniensis, S. eminens, S. intermedia, S. lancastriensis, S. latifolia, S. leptophylla, S. pseudofennica, S. rupicola). The diploid hybrids (S.×thuringiaca, S.×vagensis) have lower stainability than their parents. Triploids (S. arranensis, S. bristoliensis, S. decipiens, S. leyana, S. minima, S. pseudomeinichii, S. whiteana, S. wilmottiana) usually have the lowest stainability. Conclusions: There is significant variation between taxa within each group, so stainability cannot be used as a proxy for ploidy level. The stainability also varies according to the parental combinations involved; hybrids with S. aucuparia have significantly lower stainability than other combinations. Assuming pollen stainability reflects pollen viability, there is potential for pollen grains of nearly all taxa to pass on genetic information to future generations through pollination of sexual taxa. © 2009 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",Alexander's stain; Fertility; Hybridisation; Ploidy level; Whitebeam,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958163941

Latex volume, instead of dry rubber, was collected as yield from each tapping. Dry rubber content (DRC) of top selections was determined for calculation of rubber yield. Distribution of seedlings in different girth, yield and DRC classes were studied. Mean range in latex yield noted in the full-sib progenies of Wickham × Wild accessions was 0.1 to 4.5 mL t-1t-1 (mL per tree per tapping) while in Wickham × Wickham progenies it was 0.1 to 19.6 mL t-1 t-1. In the clonal half-sibs (HS), mean yield was low in HS progenies of RRII 105 and PB 330 while in RRII 414 and RRII 429 it was higher. Maximum latex yield noted from a tapping was 33.0 mL t -1t-1. Dry rubber yield in the top 20% selections showed a range of 0. 7 to 4.1 g t-1 t-1 (grams per tree per tapping). Mean yield from 10 tappings ranged from 7 to 41 g t-1 10 t-1 (grams per tree per 10 tappings). DRC among the top 20% selections varied from 14.3% to 38%. In the low girth class only one was included in the top 20% of selections. Moderate and average girth classes each contributed 41 and 38 seedlings that included most of the top 20% of selections. It was concluded that test-tapping at age three, rather than at two, was more useful. Measurement of yield in terms of latex volume as opposed to that of dry rubber yield, can result in more accurate yield recording. Latex can be used for determining rubber content and biochemical and physiological determinants of yield that can further boost the probability of potential selections. For maximum genetic gain in juvenile selection, seedlings of moderate to high girth class and average yield seemed more promising.",Juvenile selection; Nursery screening; Seedling performance; Test-tapping,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849158714

Taking into account bees' contributions to other flowering agricultural crops, about one-third of our total diet comes directly or indirectly from bee-pollinated plants. However, in recent years there increasingly have been worrisome alarm sounds on serious bee mortalities and mysterious disappearance of bees from beehives. Among several environmental factors (e.g. climate and bee pathogens), stress factors arising from agricultural practices can potentially play a role in bee losses. Detailed knowledge on the effects of plant protection products is essential to improve usage with minimal risks. In order to identify potential medium- and long-term effects, we followed up various sublethal contaminated hives during the prolongation of the fruit-growing season. More specifically, a large-scale experiment was conducted in which at four distinct locations (in the Limburg region of Belgium) four different bee colonies (representing three different contaminations -imidacloprid, fenoxycarb, indoxacarb- and a non-contaminated control hive) were thoroughly monitored every 2-7 days. Our observations point towards decays of overall colony vitality for several hives a couple of weeks after treatment, as indicated by a set of carefully assessed parameters including the total amount of active and dead bees, total surface of capped brood and overall colony weight. These outcomes could be linked to subtle differences in foraging activity between distinct hives. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of potential short-term and long-term consequences of disturbed foraging ability triggered by exaggerated exposure to sublethal doses of crop protection chemicals, and its potential impact on colony health.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950468932

This partial niche separation has most often been explored using abiotic niche axes. However, if the sexes are truly separated in space, then they are apt to encounter different plant species that may heavily affect growth and reproduction. Also, to the extent that their niches differ, the sexes may respond differently to the same co-occurring species. Here we examine interspecific interactions that influence male and female reproductive potential in Atriplex bonnevillensis. Using Emlen's interaction assessment, a technique which assesses species interactions based on cover classes, we show that Salsola species compete significantly with females but not males, while Halogeton glomeratus competes with males but not females. The effect of competition only became apparent when we corrected for site-specific fertility.

The highest genetic diversity was found within plants from each state, and significant genetic differentiation (FST=0.1921, AFLPs and 0.1911, SSRs) was also observed among mango populations based on geographical origin and genetic status (cultivars versus landraces). Heterozygosity values ranged from low (0.38) to moderate (0.68), and no heterozygote deficits were found. The highest genetic variability was found in mango populations from Tabasco, Michoacn and Oaxaca.

However, site switching between patches tends to occur with low frequency while a given patch is still rewarding, thus reducing pollen dispersal and gene flow between patches. In principle, forager switching and gene flow between patches could be higher when close patches offer similar rewards. We investigated site switching during food recruitment in the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. Thus, we trained three groups of foragers to three feeders in different locations, one group per location. These groups did not interact each other during the training phase. Next, interaction among trained foragers was allowed. We found that roughly half of the foragers switched sites, the other half remaining faithful to its training feeder. Switching is influenced by the presence of recruitment information. In the absence of recruitment information (bees visiting and recruiting for feeders), employed foragers were site specific. Foragers only switched among feeders that were being visited and recruited to. Switching was not caused by learned aversion to experimental handling. Switching in response to recruitment could provide a fitness benefit to the colony by facilitating rapid switching among exploited patches and provide a benefit of increasing plant gene flow between patches. © 2009 El Colegio de la Frontera Sur.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449556457

Fruit normally develops from the ovary after pollination and fertilization. However, the ovary can also generate seedless fruit without fertilization by parthenocarpy. Parthenocarpic fruit development has been obtained in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) by genetic modification using auxin-synthesising gene(s) (DefH9-iaaM; DefH9-RI-iaaM) expressed specifically in the placenta and ovules. Findings. We have performed a cDNA Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis on pre-anthesis tomato flower buds (0.5 cm long) collected from DefH9-iaaM and DefH9-RI-iaaM parthenocarpic and wild-type plants, with the aim to identify genes involved in very early phases of tomato fruit development. We detected 212 transcripts differentially expressed in auxin-ipersynthesising pre-anthesis flower buds, 65 of them (31%) have unknown function. Several differentially expressed genes show homology to genes involved in protein trafficking and protein degradation via proteasome. These processes are crucial for auxin cellular transport and signaling, respectively. Conclusion. The data presented might contribute to elucidate the molecular basis of the fruiting process and to develop new methods to confer parthenocarpy to species of agronomic interest. In a recently published work, we have demonstrated that one of the genes identified in this screening, corresponding to #109 cDNA clone, regulates auxin-dependent fruit initiation and its suppression causes parthenocarpic fruit development in tomato. © 2009 Molesini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77049118055

Twenty commonly available S. japonica cultivars were evaluated for fertility using pollen and seed germination. Clones were grown in a randomized, replicated field plot, and additional seed samples were obtained from commercial nurseries and hand-pollinations in the greenhouse. Three sterile cultivars were identified: 'Crispa', 'Dart's Red', and 'Neon Flash'. These cultivars demonstrated poor anther dehiscence and very low mean pollen germination, 2.7%, 3.0%, and 1.3%, respectively, which often produced abnormal pollen tubes. None of these three cultivars produced viable seed in the field plot, at commercial nurseries, or when hand-pollinated in the greenhouse, whereas seed germination from fertile clones ranged from 91.5% to 100%. The other 17 cultivars tested, which should be treated as entirely fertile for the purposes of invasive plant management, were 'Albiflora', 'Anthony Waterer', 'Candlelight', 'Dakota Goldcharm', var. alpina 'Daphne', 'Flaming Mound', 'Flowering Choice', 'Froebelii', 'Golden Princess', 'Goldflame', 'Goldmound', 'Gumball', 'Lemon Princess', 'Little Princess', 'Magic Carpet', 'Norman', and 'Shibori'. Measurements of DNA content indicated that all tested clones are diploid; therefore, the observed sterility was not related to polyploidy. The identification of these three sterile cultivars can help reduce the use of fertile varieties in areas where Japanese spirea has shown the potential to become invasive.",DNA content; Introduced species; Spiraea ×bumalda; Spiraea japonica; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72849124072

In consequence, new genetic modified varieties (GMV) have been obtained by biotechnological methods, which offer a wide range of special oils for bio-energetic purposes. However, growing sunflower GMVs for biodiesel production could create a potential risk due to pollen flow from transgenic to non-transgenic varieties when grown in the same geographic areas. Presently, pollen flow analysis by DNA-based tools is expensive and time consuming, and new, cheap and rapid methods are needed. The goal of this research was to estimate pollen flow in sunflower by using a ""composite"" line, with a monogenic dominant marker (TT) for a high phenotypic expression of blue leaf nervure, as pollinator, and an inbred line and a cytoplasmic male sterile line (cms) as recipient plants.

To investigate the exact role that the PG gene has played in pollen development and about this family in general, one putative PG gene, Brassica campestris Male Fertility 9 (BcMF9), was isolated from Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis, syn. B. rapa ssp. chinensis) and characterized.MethodsRT-PCR, northern blotting and in situ hybridization were used to analyse the expression pattern of BcMF9, and antisense RNA technology was applied to study the function of this gene.Key ResultsBcMF9 is expressed in particular in the tapetum and microspore during the late stages of pollen development. Antisense RNA transgenic plants that displayed decreased expression of BcMF9 showed pollen morphological defects that resulted in reduced pollen germination efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the homogeneous pectic exintine layer of pollen facing the exterior was over-developed and predominantly occupied the intine, reversing the normal proportional distribution of the internal endintine layer and the external exintine in transgenic pollen. Inhibition of BcMF9 also resulted in break-up of the previously formed tectum and baculae from the beginning of the binucleate stage, as a result of premature degradation of tapetum. ConclusionsSeveral lines of evidence, including patterns of BcMF9 expression and phenotypic defects, suggest a sporophytic role in exine patterning, and a gametophytic mode of action of BcMF9 in intine formation. BcMF9 might act as a co-ordinator in the late stages of tapetum degeneration, and subsequently in the regulation of wall material secretion and, in turn, exine formation. BcMF9 might also play a role in intine formation, possibly via regulation of the dynamic metabolism of pectin.",BcMF9; Brassica campestris; Chinese cabbage; Exine; Intine; PG; Pollen wall; Polygalacturonase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73149090807

We studied the effect of honeybees on the foraging behavior of native solitary bees in Israel, within the natural distribution range of the honeybee, by manipulating the presence and absence of beehives in the study sites: Ramat Hanadiv Park and Carmel National Park. We examined the possible degree of competition between honeybees and native solitary bees by observing their foraging on focal nectariferous plants. Temporal introduction of hives increased the visitation frequencies of honeybees to our focal plants and decreased the overall average visitation frequencies of native solitary bees. However, the effect of honeybees varied among native bee species, focal plants, and years. In some cases, honeybees had a negative effect on visitation rates of the other bees, while in other cases we did not find such an effect. The other bees also did not shift to forage on other flowering plants, and did not change their temporal activity pattern as a response to increased foraging by honeybees. The results provide partial evidence for behavioral competition between honeybees and native bees. For this reason, we recommend prohibiting introduction of beehives to all nature reserves in Israel, as a precaution aimed at protecting the native bee fauna.

Q. Yin ex H. N. Qin & Phengklai (Nyssaceae) is a critically endangered range-restricted tree species known from only three small populations in a tropical forest area of southern Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Two types of individuals occur, one bearing staminate flowers and the other with morphologically perfect flowers that produce both pollen and fruit, suggesting an androdioecious breeding system. Field and laboratory studies conducted between 2004 and 2007 indicate, however, that N. yunnanensis is functionally dioecious: pollen from the morphologically perfect flowers is inaperturate and inviable, rendering the trees that bear these flowers functionally female. Field observations showed that the staminate flowers opened 10 to 15 days earlier than the protogynous female flowers but that flowering ceased at nearly the same time in both sexes. Thirty-six species of insects were observed and collected visiting the flowers of N. yunnanensis, four of which served as effective pollinators. Breeding system experiments demonstrated that the predominantly entomophilous pollination system is supplemented by anemophily and further indicated that N. yunnanensis is xenogamous and does not appear to exhibit parthenogenesis. The average sex ratio of individuals within the three populations was female-biased (0.571), but the ratio among flowers was male-biased (2.561) because flower production was higher in males. The 37 known trees of N. yunnanensis are likely the remnants of a once more widespread, abundant species that has been heavily impacted by human disturbance, a fate shared with many other threatened Southeast Asian taxa whose continued survival will require dedicated conservation efforts informed by a detailed understanding of population structure and reproductive biology. © Missouri Botanical Press 2009.",Androdioecy; Critically endangered; Cryptic dioecy; Floral phenology; IUCN Red List; Nyssa; Nyssa yunnanensis; Nyssaceae; Pollen viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449125435

Self-incompatibility is a genetic system that prevents the self-fertilization allowing the pistil to reject the pollen of genetically close individuals. Self-incompatibility is controlled by a single multi-allelic locus, the S locus. Sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) has been reported in: Asteraceae, Betulaceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophillaceae, Convolvulaceae and Sterculiaceae. The involved molecular mechanisms are still partly unknown except for the Brassicaceae. Studies on gene regulation of fertility, pollination and fertilization in hazelnut are very few; so with this research we propose to contribute to the knowledge about the mechanism of sporophytic self-incompatibility in hazelnut. The Differential Display technique was applied for the study of the female determinant of self-incompatibility. Two developmental stages of styles/stygmas were compared: before emergence from the bud and at full bloom. The results allowed isolation of partial sequences that showed an interesting homology degree with the transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptor of Brassica oleracea. Believing that the female determinant of self-incompatibility in hazelnut is very likely a membrane receptor, the effort in obtaining differentially expressed sequences of this type was increased. Primers were designed on conserved regions of serine-threonine kinase receptors.

We sought to elucidate the optimal date to close high tunnels to hasten vegetative and reproductive growth of organic southern highbush blueberry cultivars Emerald and Jewel grown in Georgia. The three dates selected to close the high tunnels were 15 Dec., 2 Jan., and 16 Jan. High tunnels raised soil and daytime air temperatures during winter months, but the tunnels did not retain heat at night and did not provide freeze protection without the use of propane heaters. The high tunnel microclimate advanced both vegetative and reproductive growth compared with outdoor plants. Averaged over the 2-year study, the 15 Dec. tunnel closure advanced flower initiation by 38 days for 'Emerald' and 39 days for 'Jewel' compared with outdoor control plants. Synchronization of flowering of the two cultivars was poor in 2007 when 'Emerald' flowered much earlier than 'Jewel' and much better in 2008. In 2007, flower and fruit development of 'Jewel' were faster than that of 'Emerald' with Jewel going from the appearance of individual flowers to ripe fruit in 80 days as compared with 105 days for 'Emerald'. Total yield was strongly correlated with fruit set (r = 0.94). 'Emerald' fruit contained higher concentrations of soluble solids and anthocyanins than 'Jewel' fruit, and anthocyanin concentrations increased throughout the harvest period. No fruit matured in 2008 as a result of freeze damage. The biggest obstacle for high tunnel production of southern highbush blueberries appears to be preventing freeze damage and assuring pollination. Cost-effective freeze protection and ways to promote good fruit set will be critical to successful production of early southern highbush blueberries in high tunnels.",Earliness; Freeze protection; Out-of-season; Pine-bark bed; Protected culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72849151608

Most of the biomass is contributed by cell walls that are distinct in composition from all other flowering plants. Identifying cell wallrelated genes and their functions underpins a fundamental understanding of growth and development in these species. Toward this goal, we are building a knowledge base of the maize (Zea mays) genes involved in cell wall biology, their expression profiles, and the phenotypic consequences of mutation. Over 750 maize genes were annotated and assembled into gene families predicted to function in cell wall biogenesis. Comparative genomics of maize, rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequences reveal differences in gene family structure between grass species and a reference eudicot species. Analysis of transcript profile data for cell wall genes in developing maize ovaries revealed that expression within families differed by up to 100-fold. When transcriptional analyses of developing ovaries before pollination from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize were contrasted, distinct sets of cell wall genes were expressed in grasses. These differences in gene family structure and expression between Arabidopsis and the grasses underscore the requirement for a grass-specific genetic model for functional analyses. A UniformMu population proved to be an important resource in both forward- and reverse-genetics approaches to identify hundreds of mutants in cell wall genes.

This insecticide has the active ingredient flonicamid (500 g/kg) belonging to a new chemical class, called pyridinecarboxamides: the product works systemic and is known as having a long lasting efficacy against all important aphid species. Bioagritest test facility of Pignola (PZ, Italy) has conducted in two successive production cycles an experimental trial on a tomato hydroponic cultivation within the Agricola Bonsai farm in Sibari (CS, Italy), whose objective was to measure the selectivity of flonicamid on Bombus terrestris, insects playing an important role in the pollination of certain species grown in greenhouse such as Tomato, Eggplant, Pepper and Cucumber. On the pollinated flower B. terrestris leaves some trace of its visit, a typical dark trademark: on the detection of the marking of flowers was based the testing program conducted by Bioagritest. Two thesis were compared: A, standard) treatment with a foliar insecticide, the neonicotinoide acetamiprid, normally used for control of aphids and whiteflies (unlike other neonicotinoides--imidacloprid and thiametoxam--quite selective about B. terrestris) and B, Teppeki) foliar treatment with Teppeki, to the maximum dose indicated on the label. The experimental design included the use of randomized blocks with 4 repetitions (4 plots/thesis with 100 plants each). In every thesis six B. terrestris hives were placed 2 days before treatment: the respective holes remained closed during the treatment and the 12 following hours. In order to verify the pollination, by the detection of the flower marking, 2 flowers per plant were observed, for a total of 200 flowers per plot. The measurements were made on the 3rd (I relief) and 8th day (II relief) after treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by the use of XLSTAT data analysis and statistical software. The analysis of collected data shows that flonicamid has a minor effect of interference with the activity of pollination by B. terrestris, compared to the standard used. 14 days after treatment, 3 hives per thesis were inspected in order to verify the status of the colonies (adults, larvae, eggs, pollen). The colonies appeared generally homogeneous as concerning the number of alive adults--100 for each--all at the end of the development cycle. There was no dead adult. Two colonies, one for thesis, presented evidence of eggs. All colonies had low stocks of pollen. Ultimately, treatment with Teppeki has not given any acute effect on B. terrestris, nor any effect of interference in respect of its pollination activity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950362082

Stylosanthes is an important range legume for humid to semiarid tropics. It is very good fodder for animals, containing about 15% crude protein with 61% in vitro dry matter digestibility. S. seabrana, in particular, is rich in lysine and sulphur-containing amino acids, which are limiting amino acids in ruminants' feed. Limited genetic variability in the germplasm and susceptibility to anthracnose disease are major challenges in Stylosanthes improvement. S. seabrana, being a self-pollinated and diploid species, has been identified as a candidate species for improvement through genetic transformation. In vitro plant regeneration is one of the pre-requisites for development of transgenic Stylosanthes with desirable traits. In the present study, we used apical meristematic axis from in vitro grown seedlings as expiant for multiple shoot induction. MS medium supplemented with BAP, Kn and TDZ, in different concentrations and combinations, were used for apical meristem culture. Best response, in terms of the number of shoots (4) per apical meristem, was observed on MS medium supplemented with 3.0mg/1 BAP. Shoot elongation was achieved on MS medium containing 2.0mg/1 GA and best rooting was induced on MS medium supplemented with 2.0mg/1 IAA. Tissue cultured plants showed normal growth, flowering and seed setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on plant regeneration via multiple shoot induction in S. seabrana. A standardized protocol would be very useful for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of Stylosanthes with the gene(s) of interest. © 2009 The Japan Mendel Society.",Direct regeneration; Multiple shoot induction; Range legume; Stylosanthes seabrana; Tissue culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953239538

Based on a large-scale inventory (100 km 2) in which all individuals of a naturally scattered forest tree (Sorbus domestica) were mapped, we inferred current gene flow by pollen using genetic paternity analysis. We detected an extensive network of effective pollen transfer. Although short pollen flow distances were most abundant, 10% of the assigned pollen donors were more than 2 km away from their female mating partners, and 1.8% were even at a distance of 12-16 km. This latter pollen flow shows that current long-distance gene flow over a fragmented landscape clearly occurs. Pollen dispersal was well described by a fat-tailed inverse curve. Using parentage analysis of established trees, maternally inherited chloroplast markers and diameter at breast height measurements as an indicator of individual tree age, we were able to infer regular seed dispersal distances over several hundred metres up to more than 10 km. We conclude that in temperate, insect-pollinated and animal-dispersed tree species such as S. domestica, fragmented subpopulations are functionally connected by gene flow through both pollen and seed. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Functional connectivity; Landscape genetics; Long-distance pollen flow; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70549108075

Seeds of this mutant frequently germinate on the head about 40 days after pollination. The cotyledons of this mutant remain green, whereas some other non-dormant mutants exhibit loss of pigmentation.

In the last few decades, the introduction of foreign varieties of pole string beans (Jerusalemski, Goldmarie, Blau Hilda, Meraviglia di Venezia) has been under way in the country as well. The vegetable breeding program of the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad, Serbia is aimed at the development of cultivars whose characteristics meet the demands of the market, processing industry, green market, intensive production and food standards and which are fully adapted to the local agroclimatic conditions. The traditional domestic local populations of pole string beans have a delicious taste. 'Tisa' and 'Resava', our new string bean cultivars, have been selected from local populations and combine superior market quality, high nutritive value and high and stable yield. The variety Tisa has pods that are long, yellow, broad, flat, and delicious to eat. It gives high and stable yields throughout the summer and fall up until the first frosts of the winter. The variety is suitable for late fall growing and indoor production. The cultivar 'Resava' has a pod that is long, green, round, crisp and succulent and has a pleasant taste.

For more than three decades, considerable resources have been spent on testing clones intended for clonal forestry, but the Swedish forestry never saw it worth to pay the added cost involved in the added gain. The efforts, however, resulted in many clone trials and developments in the technique for clone production and propagation. Theoretically, clone testing is faster and cheaper than progeny testing and more reliable than selecting individuals forwards. Nowadays, the main line in long-term breeding is to make crosses between the best trees and test-cloned full-sibs as a recruitment population for long-term breeding and seed orchards. Since controlled crosses are a bottleneck for long-term breeding, a possibility is to rely on wind pollination (Breeding Without Breeding; BWB) in trials for testing clones. The seed parent is known, and that the pollen parent is a desirable genotype can be checked by molecular markers. BWB has the potential to eliminate the waiting time between selection and recombination, which is particularly important in a late and irregularly flowering species such as Norway spruce. Clone testing ensures that the breeding values are known from the same tests as those used for BWB. Another option for BWB is to place in seed orchards a few ramets of clones belonging to the breeding population, but normally not deserving such a use, with the hope that their presence will make it possible to rely on wind pollination to recombine the whole breeding population.",Breeding without breeding; Long-term breeding; Norway spruce; Rooted cuttings; Seed orchards,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75449114093

Date of commencement of both pollen shed and female bloom varied between seasons and sites but the order of both pollen shed and female bloom for genotypes showed very little variation. The earlier the genotypes came into pollen shed, the longer the period that pollen was shed. The genotypes were protandrous. A study was undertaken using temperature controlled cabinets. Material from a range of genotypes was cut weekly and placed in cabinets where temperatures were maintained at 10°C and 15°C. Pollen shed was observed to occur in the cabinets up to nine weeks earlier than it occurred for the same genotype in the field but female bloom did not occur any earlier in the cabinets than in the field. It is hypothesised that there are two physiological processes affecting catkin extension: chilling, which causes a decline in a plant regulating substance preventing catkin extension and warmth, causing the production of a substance which stimulates catkin extension. Once the balance tilts in favour of the stimulating substance, catkin extension occurs. In the female flower, the principle factor is considered to be a decline in the retarding substance due to chilling; once this is at sufficiently low levels, flowering occurs. There is concern that with global warming, pollen shed may occur earlier, relative to female bloom, resulting in poor pollination for later blooming varieties.",Bloom; Hazelnut genotypes; Pollen shed; Temperatures,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75449102001

The mean number of roots per seedling (4.2) was greater for plantlets that derived from the cold pollination treatment compared to those from warm pollination (3.6). Weight of the seedlings, number of roots and the average root length were significantly affected by the interaction between pollination treatment and germination temperature. The weight, number of leaves, and average root length were significantly affected by the interaction between pollination treatment and incubator/growth chamber. The results indicated that seedlings derived from warm pollination were more vigorous under warm growing conditions and those derived from cold pollination were more vigorous under cold growing conditions. Genetic variation among 16 F1 seedlings randomly selected from various temperature treatments was analyzed. A dendrogram based on 651 loci resulted in three major groups and one subgroup. The groups and subgroup revealed common selection pressure during the gametophytic stage. The AFLP data support genetic differentiation of Phalaenopsis hybrids pollinated under different temperatures. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",AFLP; Certation; Male gametophytic selection; Moth orchid; Thermotolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76149095168

We have conducted a range-wide study of genetic diversity in a plant endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, Vriesea gigantea (Bromeliaceae), based on a combined data set of nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast (cp) DNA markers typed in 429 plants from 13 populations. The results indicate a strong negative correlation between genetic diversity and population latitude, consistent with historical forest expansion from the northern half of the present distribution range. A deep phylogeographic split exists between the Brazilian states of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro at ca. 23 °S latitude, probably reflecting past population isolation within more than one glacial refuge during the climatic changes of the Pleistocene. A comparison of genetic structures at cpDNA and nuclear markers revealed a pollen/seed flow ratio of more than 3:1, thus indicating an important role of the pollinating animals (that is, bats) in shaping the population genetic structure of this species. Diversity was reduced for cpDNA markers in the island populations off the coast, and reduced diversity and increased differentiation were observed for both nuclear and cpDNA at the edges of the species' range. The link between patterns of genetic and species diversity supports the hypothesis that both were shaped by the same biogeographic processes, triggered by the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Biodiversity; Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; Bromeliad; Marginal populations; Microsatellite; Population genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70549101153

In maize synthesis begin 10-12 days after pollination (DAP) and peaks about 18-24 DAP. The major fraction of storage proteins in maize is classified as prolamins, which are rich in the amino acids proline and glutamine. Although storage proteins can accumulate in embryo tissue, the maize prolamins, also called zeins, accumulate in the triploid endosperm. Localization in either embryo or endosperm, however, requires the onset of the synthesis of tissue-specific trans-acting factors in a temporal fashion. It was therefore unexpected that one of the zein genes is strongly expressed in tissue culture. When a chimeric gene controlling expression of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was introduced into immature cultured embryos by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, the GFP gave rise to green callus, indicating that the 27-kDa promoter of the gamma zein gene was active. Subsequent analysis of the endogenous 27-kDa gammazein gene showed that 27-kDa gamma-zein protein was made as well, indicating that expression of this gene was not due to the transformation procedure itself. This could be further demonstrated by the fact that the general transacting factor of prolamin genes, the prolamin-box-binding factor (PBF), was also expressed in the green callus. However, the 02 transcription factor that is required for the expression of a subset of alpha zein genes was not expressed, suggesting that tissue-specificity evolved into the combinatorial action of different trans-acting factors along with younger target genes arising from gene duplications.",Developmental gene expression; Gamma zein; Maize; Promoter specificity; Storage proteins,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951900471

Fruits growing in a commercial seed production field were collected every 7 days, starting 14 days after pollination (DAP) up to 63 DAP (commercial harvest time). Seeds were isolated and the proportion of nuclei with different DNA contents in the whole seeds and in the embryos was analysed. Germination capacity of fresh and dried seeds at 25°C was established. In addition, the same analyses were performed on the seeds after processing (fermentation, drying and cleaning), following 1 and 2 years of storage, and after imbibition for 3, 6 and 12 h. In the young developing seeds, endoreduplication up to 128C occurred but this decreased to 8C by maturity. The proportion of endosperm nuclei was the highest at 21 DAP (30%) and then decreased to below 14% at harvest and 8% after processing. In the mature processed seeds, the majority of embryo nuclei (about 80%) contained 2C DNA; however, about 2% of endoreduplicated (8C) nuclei were still present.

Efforts to control the disease and mitigate damage to date have been only somewhat effective. Recent efforts to improve the health of eastern white pine and reestablish the tree as a dominant species in the North Central United States have focused on identification and propagation of disease-free eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) growing in areas with a high incidence of blister rust. Many of these selections have been shown to resist infection following artificial inoculation with C. ribicola. In this study, 13 eastern white pine families derived from controlled pollination of selections previously determined to possess putative resistance as well as susceptible selections were inoculated with C. ribicola. Mortality data from inoculation studies show superior survivability in three families with over 60% of seedlings able to survive the 52 week post-inoculation monitoring period compared to 0-10% survival of the most susceptible families. Primary needles were collected for histological analysis from all inoculated families 4 weeks after inoculation and from selected families 6.5 weeks and 38 weeks after inoculation. Histological observations of infection sites show distinct resistance reactions in the families more likely to survive infection based on mortality data. Analysis of the reactions in susceptible families revealed extensive hyphal colonization of the vascular bundle and adjacent mesophyll cells that appear uninhibited by tree responses. In resistant families, collapsed cells adjacent to infection sites, heavy deposition of phenolic compounds and abnormal cell growth were documented more frequently and appear to play an integral role in the ability of these eastern white pine families to impede growth of C. ribicola in primary needle tissue. © 2009 University of Minnesota.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71449096591

Until recently, all of them were only known from the type specimens, for which reason it has been difficult to judge if some of them were actually conspecific. The recent discovery of two large populations of C. exigua in Thailand made it possible to describe the range of variation of this species in much more detail, and we then found it to be well distinguished from the others. A phylogenetic analysis based on nuclear rDNA ITS sequences corroborated the systematic position of C. exigua at the generic level. Examination of the previously neglected type of C. pusilla from Myanmar lead to the conclusion that this taxon of disputed generic affinity likewise belongs to Cephalanthera, and that it is a clearly distinct species. Finally, we accept that also C. ericiflora from Laos as well as C. gracilis and C. calcarata from Yunnan are probably distinct species. Cephalanthera exigua grows in hill evergreen forest, but we found little floristic similarity between its two localities in Thailand (IS S =22.5%). Ectomycorrhizal trees of the families Fagaceae and Ulmaceae are probably the ultimate carbon source for C. exigua at both sites, as the mycorrhizal partners of this orchid (basidiomycetes of the family Thelephoraceae) obtain their carbon nutrition through ectomycorrhizal association with forest trees. Pollination experiments demonstrated that the nectarless flowers of C. exigua are not spontaneously autogamous. Based on the pollination syndrome and previously published observations on other species of the genus, we suggest that C. exigua has an insect-operated breeding system acting by deceit, and that the pollinators are probably solitary bees. © The Authors.

In Poland one of the strictly protected plant requiring an active conservation is globeflower Trollius europaeus L. It is the perennial forb, consisted of numerous dark green, deeply cut basal leaves and generative shoots with flowers composed of several multi-ovulate carpels. The investigations of morphological traits of Trollius europaeus i.e. number and height of generative shoots and basal leaves as well as the production of flowers, multi-follicles and follicles at stem- and cluster levels, were carried out between 2005 and 2008 on two patches of Molinietutn caeruleae localized in Kraków vicinity (Southern Poland) and having different height of litter and herb layer. The study plot labelled NS- ""not shaded"" (2 000 m 2) was prevailed by perennials with delicate procumbent or erect stems, small-tussock grass or short rosetteforb species. The height of the tallest plant has not exceeded 98 cm, while the litter layer measured from 10 cm to 28 cm. The study plot named SH- ""shaded"" (6 000 m2 ) was characterised by presence of tall perennials as well as grass and sedges forming large compact tussocks. The tallest plants attained 186 cm, whereas the layer of litter reached from 18 cm to 42 cm. In NS plot -32 clusters were observed, whereas in SH plot 39 clusters occurred. In both populations, clusters were situated in close vicinity, forming large aggregations. The number of aboveground units per cluster in both populations were similar. The longer petioles (higher petiole average length), caused by maximization of light capture were noted in SH, than in NS plot. In SH plot higher sexual shoots were also noted as well as greater number of flowers per shoot. Such phenomenon presumably makes the plant more attractive for pollinators and thus pollen receipt and donation. The similar number of flowers and multi-follicles per cluster were observed in both populations, while the greater number of follicles was observed in NS, than in SH plot. Due to morphological plasticity established clusters of T. europaeus might presumably endure among the vegetation cover or adapt to new environmental conditions. It might be considered that making the gaps in vegetation cover and litter can be an effective way for active protection of Trollius europaeus populations.",Basal leaf; Cluster; Generative shoot; Plasticity; Trollius europaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149140824

The sediments were deposited in a marginal marine environment in an area presently occupied by the northern flank of the Venezuelan Andes. The palynofloras are well preserved and diverse and provide insight into the ancient vegetation of Venezuela. Pollen-bearing viscin threads from the Upper Cretaceous Mito Juan Formation are assigned to the genus Colombipollis Sarmiento Prez 1994. The pollen grains are tri(col)porate, normally quite smooth, and most often viewed in an oblate (flattened) state. The viscin threads are on the proximal and distal sides of the pollen and vary in length; they appear to have a simple morphology unlike the complex, ropelike threads seen on pollen of the Onagraceae and some other angiosperm families. All observations to date are made using a standard light microscope but more morphological detail could be revealed using scanning electron microscopy. The pollen exhibiting viscin threads from the Paleocene Los Cuervos Formation are clearly related to onagraceous types and are assigned to the genus Corsinipollenites Nakomen 1995. The pollen is triporate and the viscin threads originate from the polar regions of the pollen. They resemble pollen reported from Eocene to Miocene deposits in the southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand) although are smaller in overall dimensions. The Venezuelan pollen reported in this paper post date the earliest record of viscin threads in the Turonian of the eastern United States. They represent the first reported forms from the South American region. In modern plants the presence of viscin threads has been related to the development of highly specific plant-pollinator relationships; their presence in the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene in Venezuela may help constrain the timing of the origin of certain insect groups in this area. © 2009 by AASP Foundation.",Colombipollis; Corsinipollenites; Cretaceous; Onagraceae; Paleocene; South America; Viscin threads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76449097182

Lily (Lilium longiflorum) stigma/style Cys-rich adhesin (SCA), a plant lipid transfer protein (LTP), is a small, secreted peptide involved in pollen tube adhesion-mediated guidance. Here, we used a reverse genetic approach to study biological roles of Arabidopsis thaliana LTP5, a SCA-like LTP. The T-DNA insertional gain-of-function mutant plant for LTP5 (ltp5-1) exhibited ballooned pollen tubes, delayed pollen tube growth, and decreased numbers of fertilized eggs. Our reciprocal cross-pollination study revealed that ltp5-1 results in both male and female partial sterility. RT-PCR and ?-glucuronidase analyses showed that LTP5 is present in pollen and the pistil TT in low levels. Pollen-targeted overexpression of either ltp5-1 or wild-type LTP5 resulted in defects in polar tip growth of pollen tubes and thereby decreased seed set, suggesting that mutant ltp5-1 acts as a dominant-active form of wild-type LTP5 in pollen tube growth. The ltp5-1 protein has additional hydrophobic C-terminal sequences, compared with LTP5. In our structural homology/molecular dynamics modeling, Tyr-91 in ltp5-1, replacing Val-91 in LTP5, was predicted to interact with Arg-45 and Tyr-81, which are known to interact with a lipid ligand in maize (Zea mays) LTP. Thus, Arabidopsis LTP5 plays a significant role in reproduction. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75649130060

Six different repeat units, ranging from 11 to 49 base pairs, were clustered within a 0.6-kb intergenic region. The number of repeat units varied from two to six. After sequence analysis of diverse melon germplasms, four haplotypes of this cluster were identified. Length variations among the four haplotypes resulted from insertion or deletion of repeat sequences. Particularly, a tandem array of six repeats of 21 nucleotides was a hotspot for insertion/deletion mutations. A simple PCR-based marker was developed to identify haplotypes of this cluster based on the length polymorphism. In practice, this marker was successfully used in genetic purity tests of melon F1 hybrid cultivars. Four self-pollinated contaminants, which were confirmed by phenotypic examination in grow-out tests, were easily discriminated from 99 F1 hybrid individuals. In addition, the genetic distance between this marker and the andromonoecious (a) locus was calculated as 7.9 cM, after analyzing melon F2 populations originating from a cross between monoecious and andromonoecious parental lines.

It finds that the Forums have provided a hospitable environment for movement crossovers to shift priorities, resources, frames, claims, campaign strategies, and coalitions in response to the emergent threat of war. It then addresses the more polemical critique of whether the WSF inhibits alliance-building with the most decisive anti-neoliberal and anti-imperial forces of our time, by examining the Beirut and Cairo anti-war conferences. It finds that the polarization and power imbalances exacerbated in these two initiatives suggest that the proscriptions delineated in the WSF Charter aimed at preserving and promoting diversity within the Forum milieus should be maintained. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Alter-globalization movement; Anti-war movement; World social forum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956179635

Pollinators, non-pollinating fig wasps, and some insects that feed internally in syconia (the fruits of figs) synchronize their developmental stages with syconia. Other insects feed and develop externally on the syconia but little is known about adaptations in these insects. We investigated the life cycle of Elasmucha necopinata, a bug that develops externally on the syconia of Ficus hispida, a functionally dioecious fig. The bug oviposits about a week after fig receptivity, the nymphs feed externally on the syconia and eclosion occurs when the syconia mature. Thus, nymphs synchronize their developmental stages with the male syconia of F. hispida.

Nevertheless, the pollen dispersal pattern of dipterocarp, main canopy tree species in palaeo-tropical forest remains unclear, and flowering intensity variation in the field suggests heterogeneity of fecundity.MethodsPollen dispersal patterns and male fecundity variation of Shorea leprosula and Shorea parvifolia ssp. parvifolia on Peninsular Malaysian were investigated during two general flowering seasons (2001 and 2002), using a neighbourhood model modified by including terms accounting for variation in male fecundity among individual trees to express heterogeneity in flowering.Key ResultsThe pollen dispersal patterns of the two dipterocarp species were affected by differences in conspecific tree flowering density, and reductions in conspecific tree flowering density led to an increased selfing rate. Active pollen dispersal and a larger number of effective paternal parents were observed for both species in the season of greater magnitude of general flowering (2002).ConclusionsThe magnitude of general flowering, male fecundity variation, and distance between pollen donors and mother trees should be taken into account when attempting to predict the effects of management practices on the self-fertilization and genetic structure of key tree species in tropical forest, and also the sustainability of possible management strategies, especially selective logging regimes.",Dipterocarp; General flowering; Male fecundity variation; Microsatellite marker; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Shorea; Tropical forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73149083258

However, it suffers with narrow genetic diversity due to genetic bottlenecks such as the recent polyploidization and self pollinating nature of the crop. In such crop species, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), as compared to other marker systems such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have been found more informative for genetic studies and breeding applications. Therefore, with an aim to develop new SSR markers in groundnut, a SSR-enriched library was constructed from the genotype ICGV 86031. Out of 29 SSRs isolated, primer pairs were designed for 23 SSR loci, of which 14 (61%) primer pairs yielded scorable amplicons. Eight (57%) primer pairs showed polymorphism among 23 groundnut genotypes that are parents of different groundnut mapping populations at ICRISAT, India and EMBRAPA, Brazil. The polymorphism information content (PIC) for polymorphic SSR markers ranged from 0.13 to 0.36, with an average of 0.25. Newly isolated SSR loci showed good interspecific transferability rates ranging from 13% to 100% across seven legumes and 43% to 100% within the seven legumes. The present set of newly developed SSR markers enriches the existing groundnut SSR repertoire and the transferable SSR markers will be useful for comparative genome analysis in related legumes. ©IJIB, All rights reserved.",Genetic diversity; Groundnut; Microsatellite; Polymorphism; Transferability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549117425

For the purpose of revealing the factors leading to low seed set, we investigated pollen viability, germination behavior of pollen grains on stigmas and embryo development in the crosses between D. grandiflorum and three wild species, D. nankingense (Nakai) Tzvel., D. indicum (L.) Des Moul. and D. zawadskii (Herb.) Tzvel. using technique of paraffin section, and light, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated pollen viability of three wild species ranged from 20 to 25%. In the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. nankingense, very few pollen grains germinated on stigmas after pollination and most of them germinated abnormally. In addition, normal embryos were observed in 12% ovaries at 8 days after pollination and thereafter all the embryos aborted. In other two crosses, many pollen grains germinated on stigmas and pollen tubes penetrated stigmas normally after pollination. Moreover, normal embryos were observed in over 50% ovaries from 8 to 15 days after pollination in the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. indicum, and seed set was 59%. In the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. zawadskii, normal embryos were observed in 52% ovaries at 8 days after pollination. After that, however, most embryos degenerated and seed set was only 9%. These data suggest that pollen viability has no significant effects on seed set of the three crosses. Very few germinated pollen grains on stigmas and abnormal growth of most pollen tubes before fertilization, and embryo abortion are the main factors causing failure of the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. nankingense, whereas only embryo abortion is a main factor resulting in low seed set in the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. zawadskii and no barriers occur in the cross between D. grandiflorum and D. indicum. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Artificial crossing; Dendranthema grandiflorum; Embryo abortion; Seed set; Wild germplasm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76149087128

This research describes breeding procedures that have been used with the objective to breed novel, commercially valuable cold-hardy and fragrant flowered cultivars of Alstroemeria. Winter-hardy hybrids were developed by using the Chilean species Alstroemeria aurea; fragrant hybrids were developed by using the Brazilian species, Alstroemeria caryophyllaea. Interspecific hybrids were bred with the assistance of in vitro techniques such as in ovulo embryo rescue, micropropagation, and somatic embryogenesis. For embryo rescue, ovaries were collected 10-23 days after hand pollination and their ovules were aseptically excised. Ovules were placed in vitro on 25% Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium under dark conditions until germination. Three weeks after germination they were subcultured onto full-strength MS medium with 2 mg benzyl adenine (BA) per liter. Subsequently, plants were subcultured every three to four weeks onto a liquid MS medium with BA until they were large enough for rooting. After in vitro rooting, plants were transferred to the greenhouse for ex vitro acclimation. Successful hybrids were evaluated under both greenhouse and field trials to determine winter survival and performance. As a result of this research, the only fragrant cultivar of Alstroemeria, 'Sweet Laura', was developed. The new Alstroemeria cultivars 'Mauve Majesty' and 'Tangerine Tango' were recently patented and introduced by Cornell University. These plants are noteworthy by their winter hardiness, everblooming growth habit, and long flower stems. As new hybrids and cultivars were developed, further research was completed to develop production and propagation protocols for the plants.

DMMADS4 encodes for protein with a predicted length of 224 amino acids; it shares 89% identity with PeMADS4 at the amino acid level. DMPI encodes for a 210 amino acid protein that showed 94% identity to PeMADS6 from Phalaenopsis. The results from RT-PCR analysis showed that DMMADS4 was transcribed in petals, lip and column; however, DMPI was expressed in all four floral whorls. Expression pattern of DMMADS4 is broader than that of PeMADS4 which is expressed only in the part of the lip. Therefore, DMMADS4 does not specify only lip development like PeMADS4. Interestingly, the expression of DMMADS4 and DMPI were also detected during the ovule development. A high level of expression of both genes was found in pre-pollinated ovules of flowers. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that DMMADS4 and DMPI were able to form heterodimers. The phenotype of 35S::DMMADS4 transformed Arabidopsis plants was indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants except plants size was reduced. However, in the 35S::DMPI plants, flowers have conversed sepals into a petaloid-like structure in whorl 1. The crossing between 35S::DMMADS4 and 35S::DMPI resulted in the alteration of sepals into petaloid-like structures in whorl 1.

Chlorophylls are the most important pigments, as they are required for photosynthesis. Carotenoids are also necessary for their functions in photosynthesis. Other plant pigments such as flavonoids play a crucial role in the interaction between plants and animals as visual signals for pollination and seed scattering. Studies related to plant pigmentation are one of the oldest areas of work in plant science. The first publication about carotenoids appeared in the early nineteenth century, and the term ""chlorophyll"" was first used in 1818 (Davies, 2004). Since then, the biochemical structure of plant pigments has been revealed, as have the biosynthetic pathways for the major pigments that provide a useful variety of colors to blossoms and other plant organs. There is widespread interest in the application of molecular methods to improve our knowledge of gene regulation mechanisms and changes in plant pigment content. Genetic modification has been used to alter pigment production in transgenic plants. This review focuses on flower pigmentation, its biochemistry and biology.

In Israel, there is an extraordinary richness in plant species, and one of the dominant insect pollinators is the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). July to February is characterized as a period of low flower abundance for local species in general and for bee forage plants in particular. In this study, we monitored the amount and number of pollen sources collected by honeybees, and where possible also identified the plant source of pollen, in four geographically distinct sites in Israel. We also assessed honeybee colonies (population level, sealed brood area, and pollen and honey stores) and studied the effect of pollen levels on population growth. Our results show that peak pollen-collection times differ according to site. The number of pollen sources from trapped pollen pellets varied during the year, between sites, and between colonies in the same site, and ranged between 5 and 20 plant species per sampling date per site. The most abundant pollen source in each sample comprised between 22 and 94% of the pollen pellets. There were only a few cases in which pollen was collected from fewer than five or more than nine plants in each colony's sample. Thus, colonies seem to specialize in only a small number of species of the available flora. Overall, in all sites, the daily amount of pollen collected was significantly correlated with sealed brood and pollen store areas. © 2009 Science From Israel/LPPltd.",Apis mellifera; Brood; Pollen trap; Protein,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049184796

The mutant phenotype resulted from an insertion of 51 base pairs that consisted of a 43 base pair near perfect palindromic sequence and an 8 base pair target site duplication. Informatic analysis identified multiple sequences in the maize genome that had similarity to the insert through the terminus of the inverted repeat. These sequences ranged from 42 to 659 bp in length, were flanked by host site duplications of 8 or 9 base pairs, and are predicted to form stable fold-back structures. There was no evidence of an insertion site sequence preference. This transposon family, named Popin, has no homology to any previously identified transposon but does have characteristics consistent with the Mutator superfamily of elements.

Over the years, they have been cultivated more intensively. This has resulted in higher rates of pest infestation, especially by the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and higher pesticide use. This, in turn, has contributed to insecticide resistance, environmental degradation, and human health impacts, which have triggered a growing interest in alternative management techniques. There is a dearth of knowledge on current pest management practices in cabbage and crucifer. Knowledge about pest management practices is necessary to develop appropriate strategies such as Integrated Pest Management. The main purpose of this study was to obtain comprehensive information on pest management practices among farmers growing cabbage and cauliflower in India. A survey was conducted in the states of Gujarat, West Bengal, and Karnataka from October 2006 through January 2007. Three hundred farmers were interviewed to obtain information on pesticide use in cabbage and cauliflower production, the cost of pesticide use, and socioeconomic characters that influence cabbage and cauliflower production. Farmers relied on pesticides as the major and often exclusive crop protection strategy. Ten of the active ingredients (16.4% of all pesticides reported by all farmers in this survey) were listed as extremely or highly hazardous (classes Ia and Ib) by the World Health Organization. The results confirmed that pesticide use differs between states of India, but that location alone does not determine pesticide spraying pattern. A regression model was used to identify determinants of pesticide application frequency and pesticide cost per hectare. After controlling for location, individual level variables, such as age, education and experience, had significant effects on how often farmers sprayed. Farmers also spent more for pesticides, and sprayed more frequently on cauliflower than on cabbage and on open-pollinated varieties than on hybrid varieties. Our findings highlight the excessive use of pesticides in cabbage and cauliflower, and the reliance on pesticides as the only pest management strategy. The results confirm the need for alternative management strategies. Bt vegetables may be one of these alternative strategies. However, it is questionable whether cultivation of Bt vegetables will reduce the strong reliance on pesticides. Small-scale farmers will need training in the identification of pests, natural enemies, basic ecology, and integrated pest management strategies to ensure sustainable and safe vegetable production. © 2009 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.",Cabbage; Cauliflower; India; Pest management; Pesticides; Vegetables,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350002111

At the initial stage, no fertilization or plant regeneration occurred in vitro between the two species, although fertilization did occur in potted conditions to some extent. It was found that pollen tubes stopped on stigma, i.e. halfway to the ovules, under a fluorescent microscope. It was also found that boric acid or calcium ions stimulated pollen tube elongation on stigma and penetration into the ovules. Boric acid treatment remarkably improved fertilization and suggested that a barrier to the pre-zygotic stage was short elongation of the pollen tube. At the post-zygotic stage, the development of the fertilized ovules and immature embryos into young plants in vitro was stimulated with coconut water. In vitro born plants were regenerated from approximately 8% of the pollinated flowers and this figure was doubled in the field.

This stage of endosperm development is important in determining seed viability and size. To identify genes involved in syncytial endosperm development, we analyzed the endosperm transcriptome, obtained using laser capture microdissection of developing seeds at four days after pollination. Our results support the idea that similar sets of genes are required for conventional somatic mitosis with cytokinesis and syncytial proliferation. Furthermore, we identify cytoskeleton associated genes that may act to facilitate syncytial development thereby providing an important resource for further characterization of the processes involved in syncytial endosperm development. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Arabidopsis; Cytoskeleton; Endosperm; Seed; Syncytium; Transcriptome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450173926

In Brassica, it is controlled by a single multiallelic locus, the S-locus, encoding a receptor kinase (SRK) expressed in the stigma papilla cells and its ligand, a small protein (SCR) located in the pollen coat. Pollen rejection is achieved only when the receptor recognizes SCR coming from the same S-allele. If a single papilla cell is simultaneously pollinated by a self- and a cross-pollen grain, it is capable of distinguishing between the two and responding accordingly, rejecting self while accepting cross pollen. This phenomenon reveals that SI response is strictly localized and does not involve the whole papilla cell. It also suggests that the distribution of SRK inside the cell may play an important role in regulating this dual response. We have recently demonstrated that SRK is mostly intracellular, only small amounts being present in distinct domains of the plasma membrane (PM), where interaction with SCR occurs. Following ligand recognition, the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed and degraded. Based on this, we propose a model of the significance of SRK intracellular trafficking for the functioning and specificity of SI response. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Internalization; S-receptor kinase; Self-incompatibility; SI Domains,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450191695

The signals and rewards are expressed via traits of flowers and fruits. Pollinators and seed dispersers could act in synergistic or antagonistic ways to influence selection on these traits. Here, we address the issue of whether plant species might be constrained in signaling to and rewarding multiple mutualists that provide different types of benefits to plants. Specifically, does investment in one type of mutualist limit investment in another? We examined the correlation between flower size and fruit size for 472 plant species spanning three regional floras. Our analyses made the assumption that structure size is related to plant investment in signals and/or rewards. We expect that a constraint due to interguild mutualisms would be evidenced by a negative correlation between flower and fruit size. Instead, we found significantly positive relationships between flower size and fruit size in all three regional floras. These relationships remained robust after correcting for plant evolutionary history using phylogenetically independent contrasts. These patterns may reflect synergies in selection by pollinators and seed dispersers, genetically-based or resource-based constraints on investment in reproductive tissues, and/or an underlying trade-off in structure size versus number. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Anthocyanins; Carotenoids; Floral morphology; Frugivory; Fruit morphology; Mutualism; Nectar; Plant-animal interactions; Pollination; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450170144

The oil content was not affected by the pollination treatment, but self-pollination resulted In significantly higher values for oleic acid. For the tocopherol homologues, the a-tocopherol content of the self-pollinated kernels was intermediate between those obtained after cross-pollination with the two foreign pollens, but the self-pollinated kernels had higher values of ?-tocopherol than the cross-pollinated kernels.

Studies have shown that variation in flower size is lower in bilateral than in radial species, but whether bilateral flowers experience more stabilizing selection pressures by employing fewer, more specialized pollinators than radial flowers remains unclear. To test the PMSS hypothesis, we investigate plant-pollinator interactions from a whole community in an alpine meadow in Hengduan Mountains, China, to examine: (i) variance in flower size and level of ecological generalization (pollinator diversity calculated using functional groups) in 14 bilateral and 13 radial species and (ii) the role pollinator diversity played in explaining the difference of variance in flower size between bilateral and radial species. Our data showed that bilateral species had less variance in flower size and were visited by fewer pollinator groups. Pollinator diversity accounted for up to 40 per cent of the difference in variance in flower size between bilateral and radial species. The mediator effect of pollinator diversity on the relationship between floral symmetry and variance in flower size in the community is consistent with the PMSS hypothesis. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Bilateral and radial; Ecological specialization; Mediator effect; Pollinator diversity; Pollinator-mediated stabilizing selection; Variance in flower size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72749108887

Extensive mutualistic networks from tropical species-rich communities, however, are extremely scarce. We present fully quantitative pollination webs of two plant-pollinator communities of natural heathland sites, one of which was in the process of being restored, on the oceanic island of Mauritius. The web interaction data cover a full flowering season from September 2003 to March 2004 and include all flowering plant and their pollinator species. Pollination webs at both sites were dominated by a few super-abundant, disproportionately well-connected species, and many rare and specialised species. The webs differed greatly in size, reflecting higher plant and pollinator species richness and abundance at the restored site. About one fifth of plant species at the smaller community received <3 visits. The main pollinators were insects from diverse taxonomic groups, while the few vertebrate pollinator species were abundant and highly linked. The difference in plant community composition between sites appeared to strongly affect the associated pollinator community and interactions with native plant species. Low visitation rate to introduced plant species suggested little indirect competition for pollinators with native plant species. Overall, our results indicated that the community structure was highly complex in comparison to temperate heathland communities. We discuss the observed differences in plant linkage and pollinator diversity and abundance between the sites with respect to habitat restoration management and its influence on pollination web structure and complexity. For habitat restoration to be successful in the long term, practitioners should aim to maintain structural diversity to support a species-rich and abundant pollinator assemblage which ensures native plant reproduction. © 2009 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.",Alien invasive species; Complex mutualistic network; Oceanic island; Plant-animal interaction; Restoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349769401

If these networks have consistent properties, then studying the structure of well-understood networks could lead to extrapolation of these properties to others, including those that support emerging pathogens. Borrowing a quantitative measure of network structure from studies of mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators, we analyzed 29 ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks - including three derived from molecular bloodmeal analysis of mosquito feeding patterns - using measures of nestedness to identify non-random interactions among species. We found significant nestedness in ectoparasite-vertebrate host lists for habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to polar environments. These networks showed non-random patterns of nesting, and did not differ significantly from published estimates of nestedness from mutualistic networks. Mutualistic and antagonistic networks appear to be organized similarly, with generalized ectoparasites interacting with hosts that attract many ectoparasites and more specialized ectoparasites usually interacting with these same ""generalized"" hosts. This finding has implications for understanding the network dynamics of vector-born pathogens. We suggest that nestedness (rather than random ectoparasite-host associations) can allow rapid transfer of pathogens throughout a network, and expand upon such concepts as the dilution effect, bridge vectors, and host switching in the context of nested ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks. © 2009 Graham et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70849115505

A review of literature revealed the shortage of empirical studies that prove direct links between policy responses and specific pressures on the pollinators. Based on written evidence and expert judgement, land use practices and the use of agrochemicals were regarded as the most significant pressures on different functional groups of pollinators. As demonstrated in the study, agricultural and rural development policy has been the key driving force of these pressures. The application of the DPSIR framework proved to be useful in identifying the pathway of human pressures on pollinators. The study also concludes that there is further need for specific empirical research on the effects and effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures (agri-environment measures in particular) to support farming practices that facilitate the protection of the environment and the prevention of pollinator loss. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts. © 2009 Wang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70649104034

Hybridization events are relatively common in vascular plants. However, the frequency of these events is unevenly distributed across the plant phylogeny. Plant families in which individual species are pollinated by specific pollinator species are predicted to be less prone to hybridization than other families. However, exceptions may occur within these families, when pollinators shift host-plant species. Indeed, host shifts are expected to increase the rate of hybridization events. Pollinators of Ficus section Galoglychia are suspected to have changed host repeatedly, based on several cases of incongruence between plant phylogeny and taxonomy, and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. We tracked cyto-nuclear discordance across section Galoglychia as evidence for hybridization. To achieve a proper global view, we first clarified the monophyly of section Galoglychia as it had been questioned by recent phylogenetic studies. Moreover, we investigated if fig size could be a factor facilitating host shifts. Results. Phylogenetic chloroplast and nuclear results demonstrated the monophyly of section Galoglychia. Within section Galoglychia, we detected several cases of statistically significant cyto-nuclear discordance. Discordances concern both terminal nodes of the phylogenetic trees and one deep node defining relationships between subsections. Because nuclear phylogeny is congruent with morphological taxonomy, discordances were caused by the chloroplast phylogeny. Introgressive hybridization was the most likely explanation for these discordances. We also detected that subsections pollinated by several wasp genera had smaller figs and were pollinated by smaller wasps than subsections pollinated by a single wasp genus. Conclusion. As hypothesized, we discovered evidences of past hybridization in Ficus section Galoglychia. Further, introgression was only detected in subsections presenting incongruence between plant and pollinator phylogenies and taxonomy. This supports the hypothesis that host shift is the cause for plant-pollinator incongruence. Moreover, small fig size could facilitate host shifts. Eventually, this study demonstrates that non-coding chloroplast markers are valuable to resolve deep nodes in Ficus phylogeny.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350754628

Labor saving was achieved by moving the system continuously, which requires a 2.5-m gap between the unit outlet and the target, in order to avoid collisions with branches. Such a gap is in contrast with efficient electrostatic applications of dry matter since it dilutes the pollen cloud and reduces the space charge. A need to increase the velocity of the pollen-carrying air stream to overcome the prevailing wind also reduces the space charge. Therefore, laboratory tests to define favorable parameters were essential to define the specific design and construction of an efficient unit. Based on the laboratory findings, an accurate-aiming electrostatic field applicator was designed, constructed, and mounted on a mobile elevated platform for use in date orchards. Tests with the field unit showed that it enabled savings of up to 90% and 70% in pollen consumption and labor use, respectively, compared with the commonly used units, while maintaining the high fruit set provided by the commercial devices. Electrostatic charging enabled reduction of pollen consumption to 0.125 g per tree in a single application. By applying excess pollen and reducing fruit set, the new system can save additional labor in the thinning operations. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",Applicator; Automation; Date tree; Electrostatic; Pollination; Savings,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350776273

In mature green vanilla pods, radioactivities of 11, 15, 29, and 24% from 14C-labeled phenylalanine, 4-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and methionine, respectively, were incorporated into glucovanillin within 24 h. In the incorporation processes of methionine and phenylalanine into glucovanillin, some of the 14C labels were also trapped by the unlabeled ferulic acid. However, 14C-labeled 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol were not converted to glucovanillin.

Although 4-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol were converted to the respective glucose esters or glucosides and vanillin was converted to glucovanillin, their conversions were believed to be from the detoxication of the aglycones.

Kaulagarh Road, Dehradun 248195 (Uttarakhand), India","Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. is an important species for agroforestry and commercial plantations in India. Results of a combined provenance-progeny trial of E. tereticornis laid out in 2002 at Midnapore (West Bengal) located in eastern tropical region of India are reported and discussed. Twelve provenances representing 70 families from Australia and Papua New Guinea were evaluated up to the age of 3 years. As a local seed source open-pollinated seed collected from a land race, i.e., Mysore gum (commonly known as Eucalyptus hybrid) was used to serve as check material (control). Significant variation in plant height, clean stem height, girth at breast height (GBH) and field survival was observed due to provenances, as well as families within provenances. This offers an ample scope to a breeder for increasing the growth and productivity in E. tereticornis through selection of provenances and families having potential for higher productivity. Heritability (narrow sense) values were appreciable for growth traits. Within provenance individual tree heritability estimates for height, clean stem length, GBH and number of branches at age 3 years were 0.318, 0.215, 0.269 and 0.231, respectively (assuming a coefficient of relationship of 0.4 for open-pollinated families of E. tereticornis). Provenance of Walsh River, Queensland Australia performed best for plant height, clean stem height, GBH, number of branches and field survival. Apart from this, the provenance from Oro bay to Emo, Papua New Guinea and Burdekin river, Queensland also showed good performance. Provenance from Yurammie, SF from New South Wales performed poorest for growth and survival. Correlations on growth traits were high and statistically significant, indicating that substantial gains could be achieved through indirect selection for one trait based on the direct selection for another. Age-age genetic correlations between age 1 and 3 years for the growth traits were highly significant and positive. Geographic clinal variation pattern was observed as latitude was negatively correlated with height and GBH (P < 0.05); longitude with number of branches (negative, P < 0.05). Fair differences were observed between phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variability. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Poorly distributed or insufficient water for crop growth requirements decreases yields in drought-prone areas such as those with a Mediterranean type environment. Cereal grain yield is a complex trait of interrelated components: plants per unit land area, spikes per plant, spikelets per spike, grains per spikelet, and single grain weight (SGW). The effect of water limitation and timing on development of yield components was studied in detail at the spike level in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Amaretto. An experiment with three watering treatments (control watering, CONT; drought prior to pollination, DR1 and terminal drought, DR2) was arranged in a large greenhouse (20 m × 30 m), with the use of standard field-trial machinery. Automated blackout curtains were used to control day length, which was set to correspond to that at 40°N. With watering treatments, two N application rates (60 and 120 kg N ha-1) were used to investigate the N effect and potential watering × N interaction on yield formation and realisation. The water deficit effect exceeded the effect of N on fertile floret and grain number and SGW. DR1 strongly reduced the number of fertile florets and grains, whereas terminal drought reduced the number of grains per spike. Resuming the watering at pollination markedly enhanced photosynthesis, and hence grain filling capacity, resulting in the highest SGW in DR1. Enhancement in availability of key resources was associated with reduced rate of fertile floret and grain abortion, which resulted in higher grain to fertile floret ratio in DR1. Spikelets in the mid-section of the spike dominated yield formation in all treatments. In DR1 this was especially emphasised as 53% of the grain yield was produced in spikelets 4-6, whereas in DR2 and CONT this was 45 and 41%, respectively. Grains in proximal position in the spikelets produced about 80% of the spike grain yield, the proportion being slightly higher in stressed plants and plants receiving 60 kg N. No marked N × water deficit treatment interaction occurred for any of the measured parameters. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, detailed empirical investigations of the consequences of introducing an alien plant species into mutualistic networks are lacking. We present the first cross-European analysis by using a standardized protocol to assess the degree to which a particular alien plant species (i.e. Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis, Impatiens glandulifera, Opuntia stricta, Rhododendron ponticum and Solanum elaeagnifolium) becomes integrated into existing native plant-pollinator networks, and how this translates to changes in network structure. Alien species were visited by almost half of the pollinator species present, accounting on average for 42 per cent of the visits and 24 per cent of the network interactions. Furthermore, in general, pollinators depended upon alien plants more than on native plants. However, despite the fact that invaded communities received more visits than uninvaded communities, the dominant role of alien species over natives did not translate into overall changes in network connectance, plant linkage level and nestedness. Our results imply that although supergeneralist alien plants can play a central role in the networks, the structure of the networks appears to be very permeable and robust to the introduction of invasive alien species into the network. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Alien plants; Invader impact; Mutualistic relationships; Nestedness; Supergeneralist plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449717511

However, the discussion on the beneficial or detrimental nature of interactions is clearly absent, or at the most, inadvertently merged into the strength debate. This deficiency is emerging with the increasing interest in theoretical studies of interactions that shift in their nature; e.g. associations that present a mixture of mutualistic and antagonistic aspects, such as pollination; or species with changes in role, such as mutualistic ants that predate on aphid partners. By exploring these models, major controversies are revealed underlying some traditional perspectives: the original Levins' community matrix reformulated into interaction and jacobian matrices, that is, interaction coefficients reinterpreted as partial derivatives, fail to recognize the ecological context of interactions. The 'effect of one species on the other' is not necessarily quantified by 'the effect of varying species densities'; and shifts in the signs of jacobian elements do not correspond to shifts in types of interaction but to stability properties. Thus, the generalised use of these approaches must be revised. On the other hand, the comparison of ultimate performances of populations when growing alone or in association, here referred to as the relative performance approach, conceptually represents the original meaning of the community matrix. This conception, although measured at population levels, is a reflection of properties at the individual level. This article inspects and discusses the formalities and ecological contexts of these approaches to characterization by means of known population interaction models: linear and non-linear, variable and non-variable; aiming to disentangle crucial conceptions that are usually mingled in the literature: the strength (magnitude) and the nature (detrimental or beneficial) of the interaction, which are sometimes used interchangeably, and the stability properties of the system, which have been misleadingly associated with the latter. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A small but ecologically and economically important group of plants classified in 28 orders, 67 families and about 528 species of angiosperms are pollinated by nectar-feeding bats. From a phylogenetic perspective this is a derived pollination mode involving a relatively large and energetically expensive pollinator. Here its ecological and evolutionary consequences are explored.Scope and Conclusions This review summarizes adaptations in bats and plants that facilitate this interaction and discusses the evolution of bat pollination from a plant phylogenetic perspective. Two families of bats contain specialized flower visitors, one in the Old World and one in the New World. Adaptation to pollination by bats has evolved independently many times from a variety of ancestral conditions, including insect-, bird- and non-volant mammal-pollination. Bat pollination predominates in very few families but is relatively common in certain angiosperm subfamilies and tribes. We propose that flower-visiting bats provide two important benefits to plants: they deposit large amounts of pollen and a variety of pollen genotypes on plant stigmas and, compared with many other pollinators, they are long-distance pollen dispersers. Bat pollination tends to occur in plants that occur in low densities and in lineages producing large flowers. In highly fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in maintaining the genetic continuity of plant populations and thus have considerable conservation value.",Angiosperms; Nectar-feeding bats; Plant phylogeny; Pollen dispersal; Pollination modes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350518636

Flowering male trees were more abundant than female ones and produced about 10-fold more flowers. Flowers of both sexes produce copious amounts of nectar on disc-like nectaries accessible to short-tongued insects. The main flower visitors observed were cetoniid beetles, bees, and vespid wasps. Pollen load analysis indicated that these insects exhibit a high degree of fidelity to D. natalensis flowers. Insects effectively transfer pollen from male to female plants resulting in about 31% of female flowers developing fruits with viable seeds. Cetoniid beetles showed significant orientation toward the scent of D. natalensis flowers in a Y-maze olfactometer. The scents of male and female flowers are similar in chemical composition and dominated by fatty acid derivatives and isothiocyanates from the glucosinolate pathway.

We examined the stable occurrence of insect pollination and wind pollination over 4 years in a population of a biennial Aconitum species (. A. gymnandrum) with actinomorphic and degenerate sepals. The total frequency of visits of two bumblebee species showed no distinct fluctuations in the studied population among the 4 years. However, seed production of netted flowers after emasculation indicated wind pollination had occurred. The seed number of bagged flowers with one visit by bumblebees was significantly less than that of netted flowers after one visit, or in control flowers. Both seed number and fruit set of netted flowers were significantly lower than in control flowers. These results suggest that wind pollination provides supplementary pollen to unvisited and/or once-visited flowers, but accounts for only a small amount of seed production compared to bumblebee pollination in natural conditions. Such a combination of insect and wind pollination might play an important role in maintaining sexual reproduction of this biennial herb, allowing it to persist in arid habitats on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, especially during Quaternary glacial periods when pollinator populations oscillated extensively. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Aconitum gymnandrum; Ambophily; Bumblebee pollination; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73349112259

We measured bee traffic from the nest to a foraging arena, which is correlated with foraging activity under natural recruitment conditions. During continuous pheromone exposure bee traffic increased by 1.5 to 3.6 times, and this increase lasted up to 105 minute. Repeated 20 minute exposures of a colony to recruitment pheromone, with at least 30 minutes intermissions, triggered consistent traffic increases over a four week period. We conclude that artificial recruitment pheromone can reliably boost bee traffic leaving previously inactive colonies. This method could improve foraging activity and pollination in greenhouse colonies, especially young colonies reluctant to start foraging after introduction to the crop. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2009.",Artificial recruitment pheromone* Bombus terrestris; Chemical communication; Crop yield; Foraging activity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73249140530

C.C. Berg (Moraceae), a threatened wind-pollinated dioecious African tree, with typically low density (?10 adults/km2). Eight microsatellite markers were used to type 287 individuals in four Cameroonian populations characterized by different habitats and tree densities. Differentiation among populations was very low. Two populations in more open habitat did not display any correlation between genetic relatedness and spatial distance between individuals, whereas significant SGS was detected in two populations situated under continuous forest cover. SGS was weak with a maximum Sp-statistic of 0.006, a value in the lower quartile of SGS estimates for trees in the literature. Using a stepwise approach with Bayesian clustering methods, we demonstrated that SGS resulted from isolation by distance and not colonization by different gene pools. Indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances ranged from ?g = 1 to 7.1 km, one order of magnitude higher than most estimates found in the literature for tropical tree species. This result can largely be explained by life-history traits of the species. Milicia excelsa exhibits a potentially wide-ranging wind-mediated pollen dispersal mechanism as well as very efficient seed dispersal mediated by large frugivorous bats. Estimations of gene flow suggested no major risk of inbreeding because of reduction in population density by exploitation. Different strategy of seed collection may be required for reforestation programmes among populations with different extent of SGS. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Central Africa; Effective population density; Gene dispersal; Iroko; Milicia excelsa; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350070718

It has been shown that figs will lose their attraction to pollinators sooner in monoecious and male dioecious figs when multiple pollinators have entered the enclosed inflorescence. However, little is known about the nature of the stimulus inducing the loss of attraction. By conducting experiments on the functionally dioecious fig, Ficus hispida, we show that (1) different stimuli induce the loss of attraction in each sex, pollination in female figs, and oviposition in male figs; and (2) foundress number affects the loss of attraction in both sexes only when the prerequisites (i.e., pollination in female figs and oviposition in male figs) have been satisfied. In general, the more foundresses that enter, the earlier the fig will lose its receptivity.

This issue is tackled here using elaborated genetic models that enable genetic and nongenetic effects to be assessed for the effectiveness of EGT in terms of (i) the selection response at one or more early generations relative to the response to direct selection at homozygosity and (ii) the probability of retaining superior lines selected during EGT. The selection response to EGT is analyzed for a model with quadratic genetic components due to additive, dominance, additive × additive, and linkage effects in selfed populations derived from a cross between two inbreds. The response to one cycle of EGT is less than the response to direct selection and decreases with nonadditive effects, repulsion linkage and reduced heritabilities. The cumulative response to two or more cycles of EGT is greater than the response to direct selection unless there are strong nonadditive effects, strong repulsion linkage, and low heritabilities. The probability of retaining a superior line at EGT decreases with increased nonadditive effects and low heritabilities. The proportion of lines needed to minimize the risk of erroneously culling superior lines increases with increased nonadditive effects and low heritabilities. Thus, EGT should be used for populations or traits with little nonadditive effect, coupling linkage and high heritability. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70749102213

The objectives of the current study were to examine pollination by a native bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii (Radoszkowski), determine the bumble bee fauna associated with red clover in Oregon, and assess if seed set is limiting. In a cage study, yields with B. vosnesenskii (average = 661 kg ha-1) and honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) (average = 640 kg ha-1) were comparable. Yields were lower compared with open pollinated plots (average = 1127 kg ha-1), which was likely due to cage effect, as seed set (# seeds/# florets per seed head) was similar in all three treatments (excluding control). Examination of the diversity of endemic bumble bees through field counts and trapping in red clover fields indicated the presence of six species. Over 92% of these were B. vosnesenskii indicating that it is the key pollinator in Oregon. Seed set across four commercial fields was high (0.84-0.88) documenting that existing pollinators, including rented honey bees, and indigenous bumble bees and solitary bees, provide close to maximum pollination of red clover in Oregon. Higher yields will require improved production practices and new cultivars with more heads per plant. Sustainability of high yields in Oregon will depend on protection of indigenous bee pollinators through conservation of habitats that provide nesting sites, judicious pesticide use, and provision of floral resources before red clover bloom. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70749126262

The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of different pollinators on the rate of seed set in three soybean cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines, JLCMS9A, JLCMS82A, and JLCMS89A. The following five treatments were applied under net room isolation-conditions: (i) insecticide application and release of alfalfa leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata) during flowering; (ii) insecticide application in the absence of leafcutter bees; (iii) release of alfalfa leafcutter bees during flowering without insecticide application; (iv) the absence of insecticide or alfalfa leafcutter bees during flowering; (v) plants without a net cover and pesticide application. Results indicated that the rate of pod production and seed set differ significantly between CMS lines and between treatments. Alfalfa leafcutter bees were an effective pollinator as evidenced by increases in pod-bearing rate and seed-set rate respectively from 21.35 to 53.22% and from 19.91 to 58.77% in the three CMS lines. The three CMS lines also showed significant differences in seed set, with JLCMS82A exhibiting the highest rate in all five treatments, followed by JLCMS9A and then JLCMS89A. These results suggested that thrips (Sericothrips variabilis) might have some effect on soybean pollination, but did not elicit a major influence based on the low increases in seed production.

This pollination mechanism is often highly specific as it is based primarily on the mimicry of mating signals, especially the female sex pheromones of the targeted pollinator. Like many deceptive orchids, the Mediterranean species Ophrys arachnitiformis shows high levels of floral trait variation, especially in the colour of the perianth, which is either green or white/pinkinsh within populations. The adaptive significance of perianth colour polymorphism and its influence on pollinator visitation rates in sexually deceptive orchids remain obscure. Methods The relative importance of floral scent versus perianth colour in pollinator attraction in this orchid pollinator mimicry system was evaluated by performing floral scent analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and behavioural bioassays with the pollinators under natural conditions were performed. Key Results The relative and absolute amounts of behaviourally active compounds are identical in the two colour morphs of O. arachnitiformis. Neither presence/absence nor the colour of the perianth (green versus white) influence attractiveness of the flowers to Colletes cunicularius males, the main pollinator of O. arachnitiformis.ConclusionChemical signals alone can mediate the interactions in highly specialized mimicry systems. Floral colour polymorphism in O. arachnitiformis is not subjected to selection imposed by C. cunicularius males, and an interplay between different non-adaptive processes may be responsible for the maintenance of floral colour polymorphism both within and among populations.",Colletes cunicularius; Floral colour polymorphism; Floral odour; Mimicry; Ophrys arachnitiformis; Pollination by sexual deception; Pollinator attraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350488667

In total, 73 pollen taxa were identified in the pollen rain. Per relevé, moss polsters and pollen traps contained 21 pollen taxa on average. Redundancy analyses (RDA) of pollen rain spectra against vegetation types yielded similar results for moss polsters and pollen traps. Spectra from forest, páramo, and cultivated field/meadows were well separated along the principal RDA axes, showing the potential to distinguish these vegetation types in pollen records. The modern pollen spectrum from a patch of páramo vegetation located in Andean forest was similar to the spectra of the surrounding forests. Likewise, the pollen spectrum from a forest patch in páramo was similar to spectra from the nearby páramo matrix. The modern pollen spectra from cultivated field/meadows hardly contained pollen taxa typically found in páramo or forest. In both forest and páramo, pollen taxa with wind-dispersed pollination syndromes were overrepresented. Clusia, Ilex, and Weinmannia (only with high percentages) seemed best to infer local presence of forest from pollen records.

Insects may use the flags as indicators of food rewards in the inflorescences below, as long-distance cues for locating and choosing flowering patches, or both. Clipping of all flags from patches of inflorescences in the field reduced the number of arriving insects, but not the total number of inflorescences and flowers visited by them. The number of flowers visited per inflorescence increased with inflorescence size, and inflorescence and flower visits rates significantly increased with patch size. Six percent of the plants in the study population did not develop any flag during blooming, yet suffered no reduction in seed set as compared to flag-bearing neighboring individuals. Removal of flags from all inflorescences in a patch reduced seed set in comparison with untreated controls, while flag clipping from ten randomly selected inflorescences in a patch did not decrease seed production. These results suggest that flags signal long-distance information to potential pollinators (possibly indicating patch location or size), while flower-related cues may indicate inflorescence quality. Plants that do not develop flags probably benefit from the flag signals displayed by their neighbors, without bearing the costs of signal production. Greenhouse-grown S. viridis plants allocated a low proportion of their biomass to flags. Plants grown under water stress did not reduce biomass allocation to flags as compared to irrigated controls. Water loss rates of picked flags were lower than those of picked leaves. These findings suggest that the expenses of flag production and maintenance are modest, reducing the selective advantage of individuals that do not carry flags. We discuss additional potential evolutionary mechanisms that may select for flag production. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71949113941

This idea has been challenged in the past decades due to increasing evidence that most plants, including those exhibiting floral syndromes, are visited by large arrays of species that differ in their effectiveness as pollinators. Our study focuses on Mecardonia tenella (Plantaginaceae) from the Araucaria forest of southern Brazil, which exhibits characteristics of the oil flower pollination syndrome. However, it is visited by three types of functional groups of bees: male orchid bees, oil-collecting bees, and pollen-seeking bees. The relative contribution of each functional group to the plant's reproductive success was estimated based on their pollen load, visitation frequency, and morphology. We assessed resources, phenology, and breeding system of M. tenella. Our results indicate that flowers lack nectar, but volatiles, lipids, and pollen are resources that can be gathered by visitors. This combination of floral traits and visitors' assemblage makes M. tenella a challenge to the concept of pollination syndromes.

To better understand the evolutionary potential of floral homeotic mutants, we established as a model system Stamenoid petals (Spe), a natural variant of Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae). In the flowers of Spe plants, petals are transformed into stamens, whereas all other floral organs are unaffected. In contrast with most other homeotic mutants, the Spe variant occurs in relatively stable populations in the wild. In order to determine how the profound change in floral architecture influences plant performance in the wild, we performed common garden experiments running over 3 years. Here, we show that Spe and wild-type plants attract the same assemblage of floral visitors: mainly hoverflies, wild bees and thrips. However, floral visitation is about twice as frequent in wild-type plants as in Spe plants. Nevertheless, the numbers of seeds per fruit were about the same in both variants. Wild-type plants produced more flowers, fruits and seeds per plant than Spe plants, whereas the germination capacity of Spe seeds was higher than that of the wild-type. Determination of volatile composition revealed monoterpenes and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, which were detected only in wild-type flowers, presumably because they are produced only by petals. Our data indicate that the similar fitness of Spe and wild-type C. bursa-pastoris in the field results from complex compensation between plant architecture and germination capacity. In contrast, flower structure and floral visitation are only of minor importance, possibly because C. bursa-pastoris is mainly self-pollinating. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Capsella; Floral homeotic mutant; Floral visitation; Germination; Plant fitness; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350217315

The abandonment of traditional land-use practices is causing forest recovery throughout the Mediterranean mountains, by increasing reduction and fragmentation of open habitats. We investigated the population genetic structure and habitat dynamics of Plantago brutia Ten., a narrow endemic in mountain pastures of S Italy. Some plants were cultivated in the botanical garden to explore the species' breeding system. Genetic diversity was evaluated based on inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms in 150 individuals from most of known stands. Recent dynamics in the species habitat were checked over a 14-year period. Flower phenology, stigma receptivity and experimental pollinations revealed protogyny and self-incompatibility. With the exception of very small and isolated populations, high genetic diversity was found at the species and population level. amova revealed weak differentiation among populations, and the Mantel test suggested absence of isolation-by-distance. Multivariate analysis of population and genetic data distinguished the populations based on genetic richness, size and isolation. Landscape analyses confirmed recent reduction and isolation of potentially suitable habitats. Low selfing, recent isolation and probable seed exchange may have preserved P. brutia populations from higher loss of genetic diversity. Nonetheless, data related to very small populations suggest that this species may suffer further fragmentation and isolation. To preserve most of the species' genetic richness, future management efforts should consider the large and isolated populations recognised in our analyses. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Conservation; Genetic diversity; Habitat loss; Inter-simple sequence repeat; Narrow endemism; Plantago brutia; Protogyny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73349092458

Nevertheless, a posteriori univariate ANOVA showed that the pollinator visit frequency was more than twofold higher in small fragments, and that gall occurrence and fruit set did not show significant differences between small and large fragments. These results suggest that the habitat fragmentation does not affect the female reproductive success of B. sericea in the studied restinga areas because resource availability seems to be a more important factor for fruit set than pollen limitation due to pollination failure. This is the first work assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation in restinga areas, which are intensely impacted by urbanization, so that no generalization about the fragmentation consequences can still be made for this ecosystem. in Portuguese is available at © 2009 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Habitat fragmentation; Insect galls; Phenology; Plant-animal interaction; Pollination; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449497725

The plant, an annual, andromonoecious, trailing-vine species, is of high social, cultural and economic value for local communities. In order to improve the yield of this crop, the first step and our aim were to elucidate its breeding system. Methods Eight experimental pollination treatments were performed during three growing seasons to assess spontaneous selfing, self-compatibility and effects of pollen source (hermaphroditic vs. male flowers). Pollination success was determined by pollen tube growth and reproductive success was assessed by fruit, seed and seedling numbers and characteristics. The pollinator guild was surveyed and the pollination distance determined both by direct observations and by indirect fluorescent dye dispersal. Key Results The species is probably pollinated by several Hymenoptera, principally by Hypotrigona para. Pollinator flight distances varied from 25 to 69 cm. No evidence for apomixis or spontaneous self-pollination in the absence of insect visitors was found. The self-fertility index (SFI = 0) indicated a total dependence on pollinators for reproductive success. The effects of hand pollination on fruit set, seed number and seedling fitness differed among years. Pollen tube growth and reproductive success did not differ between self- and cross-pollinations. Accordingly, a high self-compatibility index for the fruit set (SCI = 1·00) and the seed number (SCI = 0·98) and a low inbreeding depression at all developmental stages (cumulative ? = 0·126) suggest a high selfing ability. Finally, pollen origin had no effect on fruit and seed sets. Conclusions This andromonoecious species has the potential for a mixed mating system with high dependence on insect-mediated pollination. The selfing rate through geitonogamy should be important.",Andromonoecy; Breeding system; Cucumis melo subsp. agrestis; Hand pollination; Inbreeding depression; Pollinators; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350520840

MS medium with 30 g l-1 sucrose was effective for germination. The effects of BA and light on germination of L. speciosa seeds differed with pod maturity. All mature seeds germinated using 0. 44 ?M BA and light. The highest frequency of germinated seedlings (60%) was obtained using mature seeds grown on MS medium without BA and under light conditions. For subculture, MS with 30 g l-1 sucrose, 2. 69 ?M NAA, and 0. 29 ?M GA3 was effective. Plantlets of 5 cm in length were transplanted to the greenhouse, and a 77. 5% of survival rate was obtained.

Plants were sampled every other week after pollination to track changes in root and shoot biomass. The carbohydrate allocation was smaller in the roots of sharers compared with owners at the pro-phase of grain filling and shoot accumulation was slightly accelerated during this period. However, at the lag phase, the accumulation rate in the shoots of individual plants was distinctly lower than in owners, as a result of earlier root senescence. Overall, shoot mass was reduced by 8% in sharers of both hybrids, while they showed a similar root to shoot ratio compared with the owners. Although the ""sharing"" treatment was confounded by larger soil spaces, the effects of larger soil volume and interplant root competition were different, and demonstrate that interplant root competition has an inhibitory effect on roots.

Apomictic seed production found in some bahiagrass cultivars may serve as a natural transgene containment system. Under greenhouse conditions, the average gene transfer frequency from an herbicide-resistant apomictic tetraploid to a population of sexual diploid bahiagrass genotypes or apomictic tetraploid bahiagrass was 0.16% when the transgenic pollen donor was placed at 0.5-1.5 m distance from the non-transgenic pollen receptors. The herbicide-resistant hybrids were characterized for transgene integration, expression and ploidy, by Southern blot analysis, immuno-chromatography and flow cytometry, respectively. Hybrids resulting from open pollination of non-transgenic diploid female plants with transgenic tetraploid male plants were triploids or near-triploids, with 2n = 26-34. These hybrids displayed a wide range of phenotypic variability, including some non-persistent or non-flowering dwarf-type hybrids with good vigor, or hybrids with vegetative growth similar to non-transgenic plants, but with significantly reduced seed set. Non-flowering aneu-triploids with good vigor/field performance will provide the highest level of transgene containment. Embryo sac analysis of pollinated spikelets confirmed a high proportion of aborted ovules. An apospory-linked RFLP marker was detected in 13 of the 15 near-triploid hybrids. All flowering aneuploid hybrids displayed significantly reduced seed set, and none of the sexual near-triploid hybrids produced any seeds. All tetraploid gene transfer events carried the apospory-linked RFLP marker, suggesting that despite the presence of the aposporus locus, a low degree of sexuality co-exists in apomictic tetraploid cultivars. Thus, tetraploid apomictic bahiagrass does not provide complete transgene containment, although intra-specific gene transfer is drastically reduced compared to sexually reproducing perennial grasses. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70949092420

Although many studies have demonstrated the crucial importance of odour signals in these systems, most flowers pollinated by pseudocopulation resemble, at least superficially, an insect body and these visual cues may be important to cheat pollinators. In this 2-year study, we show that the shape of the labellum of Geoblasta pennicillata is a target of pollinator-mediated natural selection. Contrary to our expectations, plants with a labellum shape more similar to female wasps were not favoured. The strength and pattern of phenotypic selection varied between study years and sexual functions. Although selection through female success was probably associated to the fine-tuning of the mechanical fit between flower form and male wasp, shape was the target of natural selection through male success in both study years indicating that male wasps use this trait when choosing flowers. The imperfect mimicry and patterns of selection observed indicated that an exact imitation is not needed to attract and deceive the pollinators and they suggested a receiver perceptual bias towards uncommon phenotypes. © 2009 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.",Geometric morphometrics; Labellum; Orchids; Phenotypic selection; Pollination; Pseudocopulation; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350407497

A common feature of all transfer cells is the labyrinth-like wall-in-growth (WIG) that increases the plasma membrane area, thereby enhancing transport capacity in these cells. To better understand WIG formation and roles of INCW2 in the BETC development, we examined wild-type and mn1 mutant developing kernels by cryofixation and electron microscopy. In Mn1 seeds, WIGs developed uniformly in the BETC layer during 7 to 17 d after pollination, and the secretory/endocytic organelles proliferated in the BETCs. Mitochondria accumulated in the vicinity of WIGs, suggesting a functional link between them. In the mn1 BETCs, WIGs were stunted and their endoplasmic reticulum was swollen; Golgi density in the mutant BETCs was 51% of the Mn1 Golgi density. However, the polarized distribution of mitochondria was not affected. INCW2-specific immunogold particles were detected in WIGs, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi stacks, and the trans-Golgi network in the Mn1 BETCs, while immunogold particles were extremely rare in the mutant BETCs. Levels of WIG development in the empty pericarp4 mutant was heterogeneous among BETCs, and INCW2 immunogold particles were approximately four times more abundant in the larger WIGs than in the stunted WIGs. These results indicate that polarized secretion is activated during WIG formation and that INCW2 is required for normal development of WIGs to which INCW2 is localized. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350686479

We asked whether cheatgrass is capable of becoming adapted to a marginal habitat, by investigating a population at a high elevation invasion edge. We used a combination of methods, including reciprocal field transplants, controlled environment studies and molecular analysis. High levels of SSR gene diversity (0.50 vs. 0.43) and comparable variation in phenotypic traits were observed at both the invasion edge and a low elevation, high-density population. Three heterozygotes were observed in the edge population, which is unusual in this predominantly self-pollinating plant. Plants from high elevations germinated more slowly in a growth chamber and had slower seedling growth rates. Survivorship was low at the edge (13%), compared with the low elevation site (55%), but surviving plants were of similar size and had equivalent reproductive output. Seed size positively affected survival and plant performance in the field and this trait was inherited. Emergence timing affected survival at the low elevation site and germination timing was also inherited. Local adaptation was seen in the low, rather than in the high elevation site, because of differential survival. While there was no evidence for local adaptation to the high elevation site observed in the field, family level and genotype-level differences in traits that affected field performance, high genetic diversity at the invasion edge, and evidence of outcrossing in this highly selfing species indicates that the potential for adaptation to a marginal habitat exists within this population. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Invasive species; Local adaptation; Natural selection; Range limits; Secondary invasion; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350041866

S-RNase is synthesized in the transmitting cell; its signal peptide is cleaved off during secretion into the transmitting tract; and the mature ""S-RNase"", the subject of this study, is taken up by growing pollen tubes via an as-yet unknown mechanism. Upon uptake, S-RNase is sequestered in a vacuolar compartment in both non-self (compatible) and self (incompatible) pollen tubes, and the subsequent disruption of this compartment in incompatible pollen tubes correlates with the onset of the SI response. How the S-RNase-containing compartment is specifically disrupted in incompatible pollen tubes, however, is unknown. Here, we circumvented the uptake step of S-RNase by directly expressing S2-RNase, S3-RNase and non-glycosylated S3-RNase of Petunia inflata, with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused at the C-terminus of each protein, in self (incompatible) and non-self (compatible) pollen of transgenic plants. We found that none of these ectopically expressed S-RNases affected the viability or the SI behavior of their self or non-self-pollen/pollen tubes. Based on GFP fluorescence of in vitro-germinated pollen tubes, all were sequestered in both self and non-self-pollen tubes. Moreover, the S-RNase-containing compartment was dynamic in living pollen tubes, with movement dependent on the actin-myosin-based molecular motor system. All these results suggest that glycosylation is not required for sequestration of S-RNase expressed in pollen tubes, and that the cytosol of pollen is the site of the cytotoxic action of S-RNase in SI. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Compartmentalization; Glycosylation; Petunia inflata; Pollen; S-RNase; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450066919

Roosevelt, B-1050 Bruxelles, Belgium","Habitat fragmentation, i.e., the reduction of populations into small isolated remnants, is expected to increase spatial genetic structure (SGS) in plant populations through nonrandom mating, lower population densities and potential aggregation of reproductive individuals. We investigated the effects of population size reduction and genetic isolation on SGS in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) using a combined experimental and simulation approach. Maritime pine is a wind-pollinated conifer which has a scattered distribution in the Iberian Peninsula as a result of forest fires and habitat fragmentation. Five highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellites were genotyped in a total of 394 individuals from two population pairs from the Iberian Peninsula, formed by one continuous and one fragmented population each. In agreement with predictions, SGS was significant and stronger in fragments (Sp = 0.020 and Sp = 0.026) than in continuous populations, where significant SGS was detected for one population only (Sp = 0.010). Simulations suggested that under fat-tailed dispersal, small population size is a stronger determinant of SGS than genetic isolation, while under normal dispersal, genetic isolation has a stronger effect. SGS was always stronger in real populations than in simulations, except if unrealistically narrow dispersal and/or high variance of reproductive success were modelled (even when accounting for potential overestimation of SGS in real populations as a result of short-distance sampling). This suggests that factors such as nonrandom mating or selection not considered in the simulations were additionally operating on SGS in Iberian maritime pine populations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Forest fragmentation; Genetic diversity; Iberian Peninsula; Pinus; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350754507

K. daigremontiana is autogamous, produces &gt;16,000 seeds per plant and also reproduces clonally. Despite low seed viability (17.9%) and germination rates (11.9%), seeds were present in the seed bank.

However, in the last decade, the presence of seeds in fruit of cultivars considered as seedless has become a problem in different citrus-growing areas because the commercial value is depreciated. Seeds have appeared concomitantly with the introduction of new cultivars that appear to be cross-compatible. To overcome this problem, different strategies have been explored, but a definitive answer is still elusive. The search for alternatives contrasts with how little is known about the basis of the problem: the pollen-pistil incompatibility reaction in mandarin, and the intercompatibility relationship between different cultivars. In this work, we characterized the pollen-pistil incompatibility in the two commonly grown mandarin cultivars Fortune and Nova, and evaluated the intercompatibility relationship between six cultivars with different genetic origins; these cultivars included Fortune (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan. × Citrus reticulata Blanco), Nova [(Citrus paradisi Macf. × C. reticulata) × C. clementina), Comune Clementine (C. clementina), Avana apireno (C. reticulata), Primosole (Citrus unshiu Marcov. × C. reticulata), and Simeto (C. unshiu × Citrus deliciosa Ten.). Following the controlled hand pollination in the field, we evaluated pollen tube performance after self- and cross-pollination, as well as intercultivar compatibility by observing pollen tube growth. The results show the self-incompatibility of these cultivars with the pollen tube having been arrested in the style, which explains their seedless condition when planted in solid blocks. The study of intercompatibility indicates a different pollen tube behavior depending on the genotype, as well as on the cross combinations. These results provide a basis to evaluate self- and intercompatibility in citrus, and the effect of close planting of some cultivars.",Citrus; Histology; Intercompatibility; Microscopic; Pollen-pistil interaction; Seedless,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949544146

Agronomic implications of saving seed from a canola crop were investigated by planting certified seed and saved-seed of an open-pollinated and a hybrid canola cultivar at eight site-years in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada. In one series of experiments cultivars and seed rates were compared, while in another experiment seed treatments and use of sized seed were investigated. Results tend to agree with similar studies with other crops where agronomic performance was unaffected when farm-saved seed from open-pollinated crops was used, but declined when this practice was used with hybrid cultivars. Using farm-saved seed from hybrid canola (HY-FSS) compared with hybrid certified seed (HYC) reduced plant population density by 16 to 18% at the time of crop maturity and yield by an average of 12%, delayed maturity by 2 d, reduced seed oil content by 5 g kg-1, and resulted in a small increase in incidence of green seed. Yield and quality loss associated with using HY-FSS could not be recovered by using increased seeding rates or by sizing and planting only large seed. The inability to use the most effective combined insecticide plus fungicide seed protectant treatments with farm-saved seed resulted in a 20% yield loss compared with treated certified hybrid seed.

Architectural effects and phenotypic plasticity in development can play an important role in intraplant floral variation, giving rise to gender dimorphism or sexual specialization. Amphicarpic plants have another source of floral variation that could also be influenced by positional effects. We studied the effects of resource availability and architecture in intraplant floral variability in two ecotypes of the amphicarpic Emex spinosa. Male flowers were smaller than females, irrespective of position or resource availability. Emex spinosa shows gender dimorphism not influenced by positional effects. Flower size differences among positions were mainly due to architecture, because the effects of resources on flower size were minimal. Architectural effects caused a decrease in female flower size from ground to apical positions but an increase in most male traits that resulted in sexual specialization at the end of flowering. In general, the ecotypes were similarly affected by resources or architecture. Differences between subterranean and aerial female flowers seem also to be a consequence of architecture. Our results contribute to the evidence that resource limitation is an overestimated effect and that architectural effects must be considered in studies of floral or fruit variation.",Amphicarpy; Architecture; Emex spinosa; Flower morphology; Monoecy; Polygonaceae; Positional effects; Sexual dimorphism; Wind-pollinated species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350707689

One example is Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae (Elaeocarpaceae), an insect-pollinated, perennial shrub confined to 4 ha of banded ironstone outcrops in the Windarling Range. Mining removed 1,900 of the 7,700 recorded plants in 2004. Further reductions could occur if it can be demonstrated that the viability of the remaining population is not threatened. To investigate the potential impact of reductions in population size due to mining we first used Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analysis to define population boundaries based on differentiated gene pools. The level of genetic diversity and spatial genetic structuring was then compared among populations that ranged in size from 46 to 4400 individuals. Analysis with 11 microsatellite loci revealed lower genetic diversity in small populations (AR = 4.5-4.8) than a large population (AR = 6.3) together with significant pair-wise differences among populations separated by distances of 80 m or more. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed the extent of spatial genetic structure differed among populations of different size, consistent with near-neighbour mating and limited dispersal. Fine scale spatial structure was consistent with historically low gene flow. Analysis of the impact of possible expansions in mining revealed small, isolated populations of T. paynterae subsp. paynterae were of high conservation value. While their removal would reduce plant numbers and genetic diversity by less than 5%, unique genotypes will be lost resulting in a 30% decline in genetic differentiation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Banded ironstone formation; Dispersal; Genetic structure; Microsatellite; Tetratheca paynterae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71349085826

The results indicate rapid changes in gene expression in early generations of C. × hytivus, which contributed to the evolution of this synthetic allotetraploid. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Allotetraploid; Cucumis; Evolution; Gene expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450230738

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Urtica dioica that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Urtica dioica is a tall, usually dioecious, rhizomatous, perennial herb with numerous stinging hairs, probably native in fens and semi-natural ancient woodlands, but widely naturalized in a range of habitats and abundant throughout the British Isles. British material is mainly ssp. dioica which also extends throughout Europe, and locally ssp. galeopsifolia (without stinging hairs) which is also found in western, central and eastern Europe. Urtica dioica is a moderately shade-tolerant species, which occurs on most moist or damp, weakly acid or weakly basic, richly fertile soils. A highly competitive ruderal species, Urtica dioica often forms monospecific stands which are not infrequently the product of a single individual that has spread by means of horizontal rhizomes. Urtica dioica has frequently been described as a nitrophile, but there are many soils in which the supply of inorganic nitrogen is adequate for growth. However, there are other soils in which growth is checked with symptoms of severe phosphorus deficiency unless soluble phosphate is added to the soil. This is especially so in the long-established deciduous woodlands, and where there has been no addition of fertilizers to the soil. The growth responses of U. dioica to the availability, source and utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus have been examined experimentally in some detail. Urtica dioica with its stems and leaves densely covered with stinging hairs, which release potential pain-inducing toxins when brushing contact is made with them, is rarely eaten by cattle and rabbits, but is palatable to some species of snail. It is the food plant of the larvae of a number of attractive butterflies and other phytophagous insects. Male clones of U. dioica flower in advance of female clones. The pollen grains are extremely small. It is usually wind-pollinated, but occasionally insect-pollinated. The low seed mass of U. dioica enables the production of vast numbers of seeds. Few of the seeds germinate in the period immediately following dispersal, and the species maintains a seed bank that changes little in size with season and is large in relation to annual seed production. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Communities; Conservation; Ecophysiology; Geographical and altitudinal distribution; Germination; Herbivory; Nutrients; Reproductive biology; Soils,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349898029

Most cultivars are diploids (2n=2x=18) and are susceptible to various diseases and insects. Polyploid cultivars in the species have some resistance to pests, but most lack cold tolerance. In this study, eight polyploid genotypes were crossed with six diploid cultivars to transfer pest resistance to the diploids. Because interploid crosses often result in aborted seed, it was necessary to use in vitro techniques. Using embryo rescue, 268 plants were recovered from 2,463 emasculated and pollinated florets (10.88% crossability). Because of the heterogeneous nature of the species, these purported hybrids could not be verified by phenotype. DNA markers were used for hybrid identification. A subset of 25 plants from crosses between the aneuploid cultivar Floratam (2n=4x=32) and five diploid cultivars were analyzed using 144 expressed sequence tags-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) developed from buffelgrass cDNA sequence data. Chi-square tests for paternal-specific markers revealed that all analyzed progeny were true F1 hybrids and none originated from self-fertilization or unintended outcrossing. In addition to identifying DNA polymorphism, the EST-SSRs revealed that genetic variation exists among all analyzed cultivars and is not partitioned between ploidy levels. The findings demonstrate that these embryo rescue techniques will enable the entire spectrum of St. Augustinegrass genetic variation to be better used through the recovery of interploid hybrids. © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2009.",Diploid; EST-SSRs; Floratam; Polyploid; Tissue culture; Turfgrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77349087796

One problem of meal quality is the dark polyphenolic pigments that accumulate in the seed coat. Seed coat-specific promoters are a pre-requisite to regulate the genes involved in seed coat development and metabolism. The ?-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was used to test an Arabidopsis promoter in developing and mature seeds of canola (Brassica napus). The promoter tested is the regulatory region of the laccase gene (AtLAC15) from Arabidopsis thaliana. The AtLAC15 promoter::GUS construct was inserted into canola double haploid line DH12075 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Southern blot analysis using a 536 bp GUS probe showed variation among the transformed plants in the T-DNA copy numbers and the position of the insertion in their genomes. Histochemical assay of the GUS enzyme in different tissues (roots, leaves, stem, pollen grains, flowers, siliques, embryos and seed coats) showed ascending GUS activity only in the seed coat from 10 days after pollination (DAP) to the fully mature stage (35 DAP). GUS stain was observed in the mucilage cell layer, in the outer integument layer of the seed coat but not in the inner integument.

Female gametogenesis in flowering plants, where a single haploid spore undergoes continuous growth and nuclear division without cytokinesis to form an eight-nucleate coenocytic embryo sac before cellularization, provides a good system to study the genetic control of such processes in multicellular organisms. Here, we report the characterization of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) female gametophyte mutant, slow walker2 (swa2), in which the progression of the mitotic cycles and the synchrony of female gametophyte development were impaired, causing an arrest of female gametophytes at the two-, four-, or eight-nucleate stage. Delayed pollination test showed that a portion of the mutant ovules were able to develop into functional embryo sacs and could be fertilized. SWA2 encodes a nucleolar protein homologous to yeast NUCLEOLAR COMPLEX ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1 (NOC1)/MAINTENANCE OF KILLER21 that, together with NOC2, is involved in preribosome export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Similarly, SWA2 can physically interact with a putative Arabidopsis NOC2 homologue. SWA2 is expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, at high levels in actively dividing tissues and gametophytes. Therefore, we conclude that SWA2 most likely plays a role in ribosome biogenesis that is essential for the coordinated mitotic progression of the female gametophyte. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350678730

Thirteen accessions, representing nine localities, are planted in a collection at the Instituto Dominicano de Investigaciones Agropecuarias y Forestales (IDIAF). We explored genetic diversity in 114 individuals from this collection. The main aim was to detect possible relationship with resistant varieties to coconut lethal yellowing (LY) disease. Contrarily to what happened in other Caribbean countries, LY never became an epidemic in the Dominican Republic. Thirteen simple sequence repeats markers from a kit dedicated to coconut diversity were used. In addition to diversity parameters, we used Bayesian assignment tests and cluster analysis to determine its population structure and its relationship with other coconut populations. The criollo coconut proved to be a typical Indo-Atlantic variety and is probably highly susceptible to the usual LY pathogens. Local conditions and the nature of the local phytoplasma strain probably explain the particular epidemiology of LY in the Dominican Republic. As a cross-pollinating variety, the criollo presents polymorphism within a population, but there is little if any variation among populations.

This phenomenon has been widely studied from a community-level perspective, but we know extremely little about how plants are able to synchronize reproduction. Here, we present the first experimental test of proximate mechanisms of mast-seeding, by preventing reproduction in an iteroparous, mast-seeding wildflower. Through a series of experiments, we show that mobile carbohydrate stores (NSC) control alternate-year flowering by individual plants; seed set depletes NSC which prevents flowering the following year. Plants are synchronized by density-dependent pollen limitation; when plants flower asynchronously, they set fewer seeds, which prevents NSC depletion. Therefore, these individual plants flower in subsequent years and become synchronized. Because mast-seeding is a consequence of physiological controls of reproduction, differences in plant resource acquisition and allocation could dramatically change patterns of seed production, and changes in plant consumers and pollinators could change selection on physiological and developmental pathways. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Alternate bearing; Astragalus scaphoides; Carbohydrate metabolism; Mast-seeding; Nonlinear dynamics; Pollen limitation; Synchrony,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350057445

Sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) is a common genetic mechanism in angiosperm that enables hermaphrodite plants to avoid selfing and promote outcrossing. The SSI phenotype is determined by the S locus and may depend on dominance relationships among alleles. Since most individuals are heterozygous at the S locus and recombination is suppressed in the Slocus region, it has been suggested that deleterious mutations could accumulate at genes linked to the S locus, generating a ""sheltered load."" In this article, we first theoretically investigate the conditions generating sheltered load in SSI. We show that deleterious mutations can accumulate in linkage with specific S alleles, and particularly if those S alleles are dominant. Second, we looked for the presence of sheltered load in Arabidopsis halleri using CO2 gas treatment to overcome self-incompatibility. By examining the segregation of S alleles and measuring the relative fitness of progeny, we found significant sheltered load associated with the most dominant S allele (S15) of three S alleles tested. This sheltered load seems to be expressed at several stages of the life cycle and to have a larger effect than genomic inbreeding depression.

However, despite its importance for conservation, little is known about the spatial scale over which these effects may arise. To investigate the consequences of between-population crosses at two distinct spatial scales, we conducted reciprocal crosses between four populations from two regions in the rare perennial herb Aster amellus. We assessed seed set and offspring fitness in a common garden experiment. Overall, between-population crosses within regions (10 km) resulted in 8% lower seed set than within-population crosses, while between-region crosses (70 km) resulted in 17% higher seed set than within-population crosses. Moreover, offspring from between-population crosses produced 18% more flower heads than offspring from within-population crosses. We conclude that hybridisation between A. amellus plants from different populations did not lead to immediate outbreeding depression and, thus, could represent a valid conservation option to increase genetic diversity. Moreover, our results suggest that the distance between populations affects the outputs of between-population crosses and therefore needs to be taken into account when promoting gene flow between populations. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Aster amellus; Conservation biology; Genetic restoration; Heterosis; Outbreeding depression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73349135666

The data model of the International Crop Information System (ICIS) allows breeding processes to be recorded unambiguously in a relational database. This paper describes this model, which underlies the Genealogical Management System (GMS) of ICIS. The model recognizes three classes of methods by which genetic material is advanced. Generative methods such as crossing or mutagenesis increase variation. Derivative methods usually involve selection, and maintenance methods conserve the genetic makeup of germplasm, such as in seed multiplications. Unlike systems that only track pedigrees, the model describes steps of selection. Applications are illustrated for self-pollinating, outcrossing, and clonally propagated crops. The ICIS GMS is in use for species including rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), lesquerella [Lesquerella fendleri (Gray) S. Wats.], and witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). The International Rice Information System, based on ICIS, holds more than 2.6 million unique identifiers for germplasm accessions, crosses, populations, and lines, requiring about 900 megabytes of storage space, which can easily be managed on a personal computer.

We used 11 allozyme markers to assay population genetic variation in six wild populations of S. laurentianum from the Magdalen Islands, Quebec (QC), the only remaining wild population from Prince Edward Island National Park (PEI), and a greenhouse population founded in 1999 with seed collected from PEI. Symphyotrichum laurentianum harbours moderate genetic diversity (Ps = 0.36, A8 = 1.54), with only modest spatial genetic structure (pairwise FST &lt; 0.15) and no significant isolation by distance. The PEI population had greatly reduced allelic diversity compared with the populations from the Magdalen Islands, which likely act as a reservoir of genetic variation in S. laurentianum. Recent loss of alleles during population decline in PEI is suggested by the retention of greater allelic diversity in the greenhouse population. Estimates of breeding structure suggest small but nonzero rates of outcross pollination (F Is = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.48-0.97; outcrossing rate ? 16%).

In an experiment, tunnel production of open-pollinated carrot varieties increased the yield and germination percentages when compared with normal field conditions. Yield was in the range of 100-250 g and 2-17 g seeds m-2 respectively, and germination percentage was 84-95 and 43-55, respectively. However, hybrid carrot seed production showed lower yields than did their open-pollinated counterparts.

Despite being components of most vegetation types, the community-level effects of parasitic plants are often ignored. The few studies adopting a broader view have revealed that these plants mediate a series of direct and indirect competitive and facilitative effects on community structure and ecosystem processes. I summarize findings from the two best-studied systems: a set of experimental and manipulative studies from northern Sweden and an integrated research programme in southern Australia, both focusing on the most abundant hemiparasite in the region -Bartsia alpina (Orobanchaceae; Lamiales) and Amyema miquelii (Loranthaceae; Santalales), respectively. Despite broad-based differences between these regions, their vegetation types and biotic constituents, rates of litter-fall, litter decomposition, nutrient return and plant growth all increased near the hemiparasites in both cases. This leads to changes in the abundance of other plants and the increased species richness and total biomass reflects an indirect form of facilitation. In addition to reallocation of nutrients from host tissues, some of the additional nutrients may be excreted by other organisms, such as visiting pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores and members of below-ground decomposer communities. Small-scale heterogeneity in nutrient availability could provide a mechanistic process underlying the role of parasitic plants as keystone resources. Parasitic plants can be regarded as either malevolent predators (Dracula) or charitable benefactors(Robin Hood), but may be better described as Dryads (Greek deities associated with specific trees, which, in addition to being reliant on their host for their wellbeing, affect nearby trees and visiting animals, rendering the surrounding stand a sacred grove). Synthesis. The Dryad role may be applicable to a wide range of facilitators, whereby indirect interactions with other organisms affect both hosts and adjacent plants, augmenting direct plant-plant interactions. However, while consistent with both case studies and information from studies of other parasitic plants, this role may be most apparent in low productivity systems. Addition, removal and animal exclosure experiments are highlighted as useful approaches to quantify the community-level influence of parasitic plants, in addition to dedicated work on the below-ground influences of parasitic plants. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Amyema; Bartsia; Facilitation; Hemiparasite; Keystone; Mistletoe; Productivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349902209

In the largest genus of Centrolepidaceae, Centrolepis, the reproductive structures are viewed either as highly unusual aggregations of reduced flowers (the pseudanthial interpretation) or as unique flowers evolved through extreme reduction in the androecium, usually accompanied by a drastic increase in carpel number and elaboration of the entire gynoecium. Comparative data are here presented on gynoecia of all three genera of Centrolepidaceae; these data strongly support the latter (euanthial) interpretation. The combined phenomenon of carpel multiplication and decrease in stamen number is unexpected in a predominantly wind-pollinated lineage.

The study included measurements of feed-borne contaminants, gene expression analyses of detoxifying and antioxidant pathways and measures of antioxidant and innate immune descriptors. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were almost undetectable in all diets, and the loading-charges of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin-like PCBs, organochlorine pesticides (OCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were at trace levels decreasing their concentrations according to the level of FO replacement with vegetable oils (0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%). Hepatic detoxifying pathways were down regulated by FO replacement, and the hepatic transcription of cytochrome P450 1A1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 was significantly reduced in fish fed the 100% vegetable oil diet. Dietary intervention did not alter the hepatic expression of the recycling glutathione reductase, whereas glutathione peroxidase-1 and phospholipid glutathione peroxidase were either down- or up-regulated by total FO replacement. This suggests that vegetable oils prime the in situ repair of peroxidized phospholipids rather than the increased turnover of membrane phospholipids from the undamaged pool of cytosolic free fatty acids. The hepatic expression of non-enzymatic antioxidants (metallothionein, glucose regulated protein 75) was down regulated in fish fed 66% and 100% vegetable oil diets. Hepatic glutathione levels and total plasma antioxidant capacity were also lowest in fish fed high levels of vegetable oils, but the concurrent increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio was interpreted as an index of reduced oxidative stress. This redox balance agrees with the enhanced respiratory burst of blood leucocytes after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation in fish feed the 100% vegetable oil. Total plasma peroxidases and plasma alternative complement pathway were not affected by dietary treatment, whereas plasma lysozyme was significantly decreased in fish fed the 66% vegetable oil diet. Taken together, the results suggest that the health and the antioxidant status of gilthead sea bream was not damaged by high levels of FO replacement in eco-friendly diets, but both the scavenging and production of reactive oxygen species were modulated in concert by complex and nutritionally mediated readjustments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The jungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) may have broken off the twigs either to peck the fruits while perching on stable branches, or possibly to remove twigs obstructing access to fruit. In contrast, brown-eared bulbuls (Hypsipetes amaurotis), oriental turtle doves (Streptopelia orientalis) and rove doves (Columba livia) ate fruits without breaking twigs. The interaction between C. camphora and C. macrorhynchos only extends back for about 20 years in urban Japan, indicating that this is unlikely to be a stable, co-evolved relationship. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Frugivores; Herbivory; Seed dispersal; Urban ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73349093762

This plant propagates by seed and the observations and field experiments revealed that it depends on bumble-bees for pollination and seed production. Fruit set as a result of spontaneous self-pollination or apomixes is low (less than 11% of the flowers excluded from pollinators mature to fruits). As a result of free pollination 45.8% of the flowers produce legumes and about half of their ovules mature to seeds.

Controlled pollination studies were also conducted on plants grown under hothouse. Observation reveals that ravine and scree wild habitats of alpine region had better flowers and seed production. Furthermore, hot house grown plants had far more superiority over wild populations for flowers and seed production. Protandry type of dichogamy was observed and is viewed as an anti-selfing mechanism. In general, higher pollen germination was achieved comparatively at low concentrations of GA3, IAA and IBA (1 ppm). Tube elongation was maximum upto 65 ?m in IAA 1 ppm and 63 ?m in IAA (5 ppm) and sucrose 5%. Dark condition along with violet color inhabits pollen germination whereas it enhances pollen tube elongation. Apomixis as well as autogamous self pollination was not observed in the species. However, fruit set differed significantly between the hand-selfed and hand-crossed treatments. Seed characteristics of open pollinated plants viz., number of seeds and seed yield per pod and plant were significantly at par than hand self pollinated flowers. Self-compatibility in the species may be a derived condition, considering that flowers are insect pollinated. The abundance and efficiency of pollinators may also affect mating patterns. The results of this study on the floral biology and breeding system of A. balfourii indicate reproductive potential of the species for cross-pollination, which would limit the production of selfed seeds and as such is likely to maintain sustainable levels of heterozygosity among the various populations. © 2009 Academic Journals Inc.",Apomixis; Control cross; Pollen germination; Protandry; Reproductive phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350300977

The aim of this study was to determine gene effects for sugar contents (sucrose, glucose, fructose and total sugar) in two waxy corns crosses (101su×101bt and 101su×216sh2-crosses). Three inbred lines (101su, 101bt and 216sh2) homozygous in waxy gene were used as parents to generate six basic populations (P1, P2, F1, F2, BC11 and BC12). Eleven entries were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The sugar contents were evaluated en masse from immature kernels at 21 days after pollination. The data were used in generation means analysis to understand gene effects. Dominance and epistatic gene effects explained most of genetic variation for sucrose and total sugar in both crosses. Negative dominance gene effect indicated that sugar content in the F1 hybrids were not as high as that of their parents. Significant additive gene effect also indicated the synergistic effect of the sweet gene combinations. Based on the results, backcross or three-way cross is the best choice to increase sweetness in waxy corn and the use of gene combinations is better than single gene.

The myrtaceous genus Balaustion Hook. is reduced to its original monotypic circumscription. Balaustion s. str. is closely related to Tilophloia Trudgen & Rye ms, both genera having stamens in a single circular series, broad filaments, a very large placenta and seeds with a large concave hilum, but Balaustion is distinguished by its prostrate habit with adventitious roots, basifixed anthers and long tubular flowers adapted to pollination by birds. A second bird-pollinated species with elongated flowers, previously known as B. microphyllum C.A.Gardner, is transferred into the new genus Cheyniana Rye as C. microphylla (C.A.Gardner) Rye. Since the type material of this species is missing, it is lectotypified on the original illustration. Another large-flowered species, but with more spreading, apparently insect-pollinated flowers, is described as C. rhodella Rye & Trudgen. Cheyniana is related to also Oxymyrrhine Schauer, which it resembles in its very reduced anthers and narrow filaments, but differs in its large colourful petals and woody indehiscent fruit.

This study determined the genetic control of heat tolerance through half diallel analysis of selected wheat genotypes. Heat induced damage o plasma membrane was assayed by membrane thermo-stability (MTS), which measure electrolyte leakage from leaf tissues after exposure to high temperature. Eight genotypes comprising heat tolerant and sensitive response to high temperature stress were hybridized in a half diallel. Electrolyte leakage or MTS was conducted at grain-filling stage of plant growth as ambien temperature become high enough to cause heat hardening of leaves. The mean square for GCA was higher in magnitude than that of SCA, but the components of genetic variance indicated considerable influence of dominance variance in determining inheritance of this trait. Results suggested that the selection for heat tolerant inbred lines based on MTS in this material may be more effective by reducing the dominance variance after a few generation of selfing particularly in a self-pollinated wheat crop.

To maximize the utility of Brachypodium as a model for basic and applied research it is necessary to develop genomic resources for it. A BAC-based physical map is one of them. A physical map will facilitate analysis of genome structure, comparative genomics, and assembly of the entire genome sequence. Results: A total of 67,151 Brachypodium BAC clones were fingerprinted with the SNaPshot HICF fingerprinting method and a genome-wide physical map of the Brachypodium genome was constructed. The map consisted of 671 contigs and 2,161 clones remained as singletons. The contigs and singletons spanned 414 Mb. A total of 13,970 gene-related sequences were detected in the BAC end sequences (BES). These gene tags aligned 345 contigs with 336 Mb of rice genome sequence, showing that Brachypodium and rice genomes are generally highly colinear. Divergent regions were mainly in the rice centromeric regions. A dot-plot of Brachypodium contigs against the rice genome sequences revealed remnants of the whole-genome duplication caused by paleotetraploidy, which were previously found in rice and sorghum. Brachypodium contigs were anchored to the wheat deletion bin maps with the BES gene-tags, opening the door to Brachypodium-Triticeae comparative genomics. Conclusion: The construction of the Brachypodium physical map, and its comparison with the rice genome sequence demonstrated the utility of the SNaPshot-HICF method in the construction of BAC-based physical maps. The map represents an important genomic resource for the completion of Brachypodium genome sequence and grass comparative genomics.

Landscape changes cause spatial and temporal bee community changes, but consequences how the community changes affect pollination is not well analyzed. This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination. The study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and coffee pollination. Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and 60% per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500 m isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit set per agro-forest. In conclusion, crops grown near intact rainforests and which profit from the pollination by many species may fluctuate less in bee-pollinated fruit set across crop plants than crop plants in isolated agriculture that receive low or even single species pollination services. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, better knowledge of which habitats bees utilize for foraging over their lifetime would inform a range of applied and theoretical questions. Traditional methods of studying foraging are either impractical for insects (e.g. radio tracking) or else are limited spatially or temporally (e.g. observations by researchers). Here we describe a method for using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from bee tissues to gain an integrated signal of which habitats a bee has foraged in over its lifetime, using three species of social stingless bee (Apidae: Meliponini) in a fragmented tropical forest landscape in southern Costa Rica as a test case. There were strongly significant differences in the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals of bees collected in the landscape extremes: the largest forests and largest open pastures in the region. We could not estimate proportions of dietary carbon and nitrogen derived from different habitats, however, due to the high sample variance. Still, isotope ratios reflect a signature of the habitat that a bee has foraged in, and we found significant relationships between foraging patterns and season, landscape context (proportion of forest surrounding sample sites) and local biotic context (bee and plant diversity and abundance). Landscape context was the most consistent factor among the analyses, in line with the idea that meliponines do not preferentially forage in deforested habitats. Bee and plant diversity and abundance showed various significant relationships with the isotopic values of the different species, but the patterns were inconsistent. These results are potentially consistent with habitat switching from pasture to forest in areas of greater competition, but the extreme spatiotemporal variability in resource density likely blurs these patterns. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

I studied the responses of social stingless (or ""meliponine"") bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) to surrounding forest cover and floral resources in 35 sites in a largely deforested landscape in Costa Rica over three years, sampling bees with a standardized netting protocol. I recorded a diverse fauna of meliponines, comprised of 20 species and nine genera. I found that meliponine species richness and abundance are strongly related to forest cover, but not floral resource variables (blooming plant species richness and abundance). The effect of forest on meliponine abundance, but not diversity, disappeared when the most common meliponine species, Trigona fulviventris (which comprised ?45% of sampled individuals), was excluded from analyses. Meliponine community composition, by contrast, was related most strongly to plant species richness, only weakly to forest cover, and not related to blooming plant abundance. This work differs from past work in the same landscape, which did not find evidence of changes in species richness or abundance of meliponines and forest-related variables (distance to forest or forest fragment size), but did find shifts toward meliponine-dominated communities near forests, especially larger ones. The larger true sample size (i.e. number of sample sites) of the present work likely improved the statistical power to detect these relationships. While meliponines are forest dependent, I recorded some species in the smallest forest fragments in the landscape, and as a group they respond strongly to overall forest cover in the landscape (i.e. including both small and large patches of forest). Both of these observations support arguments for preserving even small fragments of forest in agricultural landscapes. Given the ecological and economic importance of meliponine bees, it is imperative that we better understand their long-term conservation needs in the changing tropical landscapes of the world. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is unclear whether findings of these investigations also apply to networks of small size. This knowledge gap is of relevance for many biological applications, including meta-communities, plant-pollinator interactions and the spread of the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in networks of plant nurseries. Moreover, many small-size biological networks are inherently asymmetrical and thus cannot be realistically modelled with undirected networks. We modelled disease spread and establishment in directed networks of 100 and 500 nodes at four levels of connectance in six network structures (local, small-world, random, one-way, uncorrelated, and two-way scale-free networks). The model was based on the probability of infection persistence in a node and of infection transmission between connected nodes. Regardless of the size of the network, the epidemic threshold did not depend on the starting node of infection but was negatively related to the correlation coefficient between in- and out-degree for all structures, unless networks were sparsely connected. In this case clustering played a significant role. For small-size scale-free directed networks to have a lower epidemic threshold than other network structures, there needs to be a positive correlation between number of links to and from nodes. When this correlation is negative (one-way scale-free networks), the epidemic threshold for small-size networks can be higher than in non-scale-free networks. Clustering does not necessarily have an influence on the epidemic threshold if connectance is kept constant. Analyses of the influence of the clustering on the epidemic threshold in directed networks can also be spurious if they do not consider simultaneously the effect of the correlation coefficient between in- and out-degree. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For this, an analysis of viral distribution in apricot reproductive organs was carried out at different developmental stages. PNRSV was detected in reproductive tissues during gametogenesis. The virus was always present in the nucellus and, in some cases, in the embryo sac. Studies within infected seeds at the embryo globular stage revealed that PNRSV infects all parts of the seed, including embryo, endosperm and testa. In the torpedo and bent cotyledon developmental stages, high concentrations of the virus were detected in the testa and endosperm. At seed maturity, PNRSV accumulated slightly more in the embryo than in the cotyledons. In situ hybridization showed the presence of PNRSV RNA in embryos obtained following hand-pollination of virus-free pistils with infected pollen. Interestingly, tissue-printing from fruits obtained from these pistils showed viral RNA in the periphery of the fruits, whereas crosses between infected pistils and infected pollen resulted in a total invasion of the fruits.

Thus, a flexible and accurate numerical model is required to assess gene flow through pollen dispersal. A three-dimensional atmospheric model combined with a diffusion transport model would be a useful tool for predicting pollen dispersal since it would be flexible enough to incorporate the effects of factors such as the spatial arrangement of crop combinations, land use, topography, windbreaks, and buildings. We applied such a model to field measurements of gene flow between two adjacent maize (Zea mays) cultivars, with suppression effects due to windbreaks, in an experimental cornfield in Japan. This combined model reproduced the measured cross-pollination distribution quite well in the case of maize plots with plant windbreaks slightly taller than the maize and without windbreaks, but the model underestimated the effect of a 6-m-tall windbreak net beyond 25 m from the donor pollen source on cross-pollination. The underestimation was most probably due to the problem of assimilated wind data. The model showed that the 6-m-tall windbreak and the plant wind break suppressed average cross-pollination rate by about 60% and 30%, respectively. Half-tall and coarser mesh windbreak net suppressed cross-pollination rates by 40% by reducing the swirl of donor pollen by reduced wind speed. © 2010 ISBR, EDP Sciences.",Cross-pollination; Maize; Numerical prediction; Pollen dispersal; Windbreak,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957781875

Here, we investigate variation in levels of herkogamy (variation in stigma-anther separation distance) in a Puerto Rican population of hummingbird pollinated Gesneria citrina Urban. There is significant variation in herkogamy levels among individuals of this species and stigma-anther separation is negatively associated with the ability to set fruits and seeds in the absence of pollinators. The variation in levels of herkogamy may represent a mechanism to ensure the production of some self-fertilized progeny in the absence of hummingbird pollinators. We also describe a novel breeding system in G. citrina, where stamens elongate over time to reach stigma height, but stamen elongation is accelerated by pollination. These results suggest that once the flowers are pollinated, stamen elongation may favor increased pollen removal and siring success, while the reduction in stigma-anther distance no longer imposes the risk of interference between male and female functions.

Despite this, the role of floral scent in angiosperm speciation and evolution remains poorly understood. Modern population genetic approaches when combined with pollination ecology can open new opportunities for studying the evolutionary role of floral scent. 2. A framework of six hypotheses for the application of population genetic tools to questions about the evolutionary role of floral scent is presented. When floral volatile chemistry is linked to pollinator attraction we can analyse questions such as: Does floral volatile composition reflect plant species boundaries? Can floral scent facilitate or suppress hybridization between taxa? Can the attraction of different pollinators influence plant mating systems and pollen-mediated gene flow? How is population genetic structure indirectly influenced by floral scent variation? 3. The application of molecular tools in sexually deceptive orchids has confirmed that volatile composition reflects species boundaries, revealed the role of shared floral odour in enabling hybridization, confirmed that the sexual attraction mediated by floral odour has implications for pollen flow and population genetic structure and provided examples of pollinator-mediated selection on floral scent variation. Interdisciplinary studies to explore links between floral volatile variation, ecology and population genetics are rare in other plant groups. 4. Ideal study systems for future floral scent research that incorporate population genetics will include closely related taxa that are morphologically similar, sympatric and co-flowering as well as groups that display wide variation in pollination mechanisms and floral volatiles. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Floral scent; Fragrance; Gene flow; Genetics; Odour; Pollination; Population; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349313367

In order to gain a balanced perspective of the importance of both wild and managed pollination services, it is essential to compare these services directly, a priori, within a cropping landscape. This process will determine the capacity of other flower visitors to act as honeybee replacements. In a highly modified New Zealand agricultural landscape, we compared the pollination services provided by managed honeybees to unmanaged pollinator taxa (including flies) within a Brassica rapa var. chinensis mass flowering crop. We evaluate overall pollinator effectiveness by separating the pollination service into two components: efficiency (i.e. per visit pollen deposition) and visit rate (i.e. pollinator abundance per available flower and the number of flower visits per minute). We observed 31 species attending flowers of B. rapa. In addition to A. mellifera, seven insect species visited flowers frequently. These were three other bees (Lasioglossum sordidum, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp.) and four flies (Dilophus nigrostigma, Melanostoma fasciatum, Melangyna novae-zelandiae and Eristalis tenax). Two bee species, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp. and one fly, Eristalis tenax were as efficient as the honeybee and as effective (in terms of rate of flower visitation). A higher honeybee abundance, however, resulted in it being the more effective pollinator overall. Synthesis and applications. Alternative land management practices that increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa to levels resulting in visitation frequencies as high as A. mellifera, have the potential to replace services provided by the honeybee.

Here, we address the question of 'why' flowers produce scent by examining the ways in which olfactory learning by insect pollinators could influence how floral scent emission evolves in plant populations. 2. Being provided with a floral scent signal allows pollinators to learn to be specific in their foraging habits, which could, in turn, produce a selective advantage for plants if sexual reproduction is limited by the income of compatible gametes. Learning studies with honeybees predict that pollinator-mediated selection for floral scent production should favour signals which are distinctive and exhibit low variation within species because these signals are learned faster. Social bees quickly learn to associate scent with the presence of nectar, and their ability to do this is generally faster and more reliable than their ability to learn visual cues. 3. Pollinators rely on floral scent as a means of distinguishing honestly signalling flowers from deceptive ones. Furthermore, a pollinator's sensitivity to differences in nectar rewards can bias the way that it responds to floral scent. This mechanism may select for flowers that provide olfactory signals as an honest indicator of the presence of nectar or which select against the production of a detectable scent signal when no nectar is present. 4. We expect that an important yet commonly overlooked function of floral scent is an improvement in short-term pollinator specificity which provides an advantage to both pollinator and plant over the use of a visual signal alone. This, in turn, impacts the evolution of plant mating systems via its influence on the species-specific patterns of floral visitation by pollinators. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Generalization; Honest signal; Honeybee; Olfaction; Pollination; Signal evolution; VOCs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349315335

Three effect sizes were estimated from the literature: diurnal, nocturnal, and hand cross-pollination (an indicator of pollen limitation). Columnar cactus pollination systems ranged from purely bat-pollinated in the tropics to generalized pollination, with diurnal visitors as effective as nocturnal visitors in extratropical regions; even when phylogenetic relatedness among species is taken into account. Metaregressions identified a latitudinal increase in pollen limitation in columnar cacti, but this increase was not significant after correcting for phylogeny. The currently available data for agaves do not support any latitudinal trend. Nectar production of columnar cacti varied with latitude. Although this variation is positively correlated with pollination by diurnal visitors, it is influenced by phylogeny.

During investigations of the reproductive biology of the orchid genus Eulophia, consistently high rates of capsule set were observed in Eulophia clavicornis var. clavicornis, E. c. var. inaequalis, E. c. var. nutans and E. tenella. A breeding system experiment showed that E. c. var. nutans is capable of autonomous self-pollination. Emasculated flowers of this taxon did not set fruit, suggesting that agamospermy is unlikely. The likely mechanism of autonomous self-pollination in these taxa was identified as the partial or complete absence of rostellum tissue, allowing contact between pollinia and stigmatic fluid, and thus for pollen tubes to grow from in situ pollinia to the ovules. In some individuals, basal flowers on an inflorescence possess intact rostellae and functional pollinaria, whereas distal flowers lack pollinia. Neither of these two flower classes set capsules. A few individuals of the otherwise outcrossing E. zeyheriana, which normally have well-developed rostellae, show evidence of autonomous self-pollination resulting from interrupted rostellae in these plants. Other outcrossing Eulophia species (E. speciosa and E. streptopetala) sometimes show high levels of fruit set, seemingly without insect visitation. However, investigations showed that these are pseudo-fruits lacking seeds and are a result of insect parasitism. Therefore, high levels of fruit set alone should not be used to infer autonomous self-pollination in orchids. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have determined whether pollinator-attractive compounds could alone assure species-specificity ('private channel'), or whether specificity is mediated by more complex 'floral filters', of which scent is only one component. 2. We examined changes in the floral volatile compounds of Ficus semicordata, a dioecious fig species, during and after pollination using headspace collection and compound identification by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). One benzenoid compound, 4-methylanisole, was strongly predominant (94-98%) among the volatile compounds emitted by both male and female receptive figs of F. semicordata, whereas it was totally absent in the volatiles emitted by figs 4 days after pollination, as well as in receptive-stage volatiles emitted by two other sympatric fig species, Ficus racemosa and Ficus hispida. 3. Bioassays using the specific pollinator of F. semicordata, Ceratosolen gravelyi, in a Y-tube olfactometer showed that 4-methylanisole was attractive to C. gravelyi in a wide range of concentrations (from 1·22 × 10-2 ng/100 ?L to 1·22 × 106ng/100?L). Moreover, chemical blends lacking 4-methylanisole were unattractive to C. gravelyi. These non-active odour sources included volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs of the two other sympatric fig species and volatiles of F. semicordata post-pollination figs. 4. All these results suggest that 4-methylanisole is the main signal compound in the floral scent of F. semicordata that attracts its obligate pollinator to the host figs at the precise stage required for pollination and oviposition. Furthermore, the high proportion of 4-methylanisole in the odours of receptive figs of both sexes was consistent with the hypothesis of chemical mimicry in dioecious figs. 5. A simple signal comprised of one compound that is unusual among Ficus and that is an infrequent, usually minor, component of other floral odours, may thus function as a private channel in this specialized obligate mutualism. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",4-methylanisole; Behavioural tests; Ceratosolen gravelyi; Chemical mediation; Dioecy; Nursery pollination mutualism; Olfactory signal; Post-pollination changes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349310322

However, a weakness of many studies claiming specificity of plant-pollinator interactions is that they are often restricted to a single locality. The aim of the present study was to investigate pollinator effectiveness of the different flower visitors to the terrestrial orchid Eulophia alta at three different localities and to analyse whether differences in pollinator abundance and composition effect this plant's reproductive success.MethodsNatural pollination was observed in vivo, and manipulative experiments were used to study the pollination biology and breeding system of E. alta at three sites near Manaus, Brazil. To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pollinator attraction, nectar composition and secretion patterns were also studied, floral scent composition was analysed and a bioassay was conducted.Key ResultsFlower visitors, pollinator composition, pollinia transfer efficiency of particular pollinator species and natural fruit set differed among the investigated populations of E. alta. Flowers were self-compatible, partially autogamous and effectively pollinated by five bee species (four Centris species and Xylocopa muscaria). Visiting insects appeared to imbibe small amounts of hexose-rich nectar. Nectar sugar content was highest on the third day after flower opening. Floral fragrance analyses revealed 42 compounds, of which monoterpenes and benzenoids predominated. A bioassay using floral parts revealed that only floral tissue from the labellum chamber and labellum tip was attractive to flower visitors.ConclusionsThe data suggest that observed differences in reproductive success in the three populations cannot be explained by absolute abundance of pollinators alone. Due to behavioural patterns such as disturbance of effective pollinators on flowers by male Centris varia bees defending territory, pollinia transfer efficiencies of particular pollinator species also vary between study sites and result in differing reproductive success.",Eulophia alta; Floral biology; Floral volatiles; GC-MS; Nectar composition; Orchidaceae; Pollinator performance; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349603060

Here we focus on species with tubular flowers and ask: ""Do differences in tube length among plant species correspond to differences in bill length among the birds that serve as pollinators?"" To answer this question, we observed 1669 bird-plant interactions at thirteen bird-pollinated plant species across a spectrum of tube lengths. Only three nectar feeding bird species pollinated the focal plant species. The relatively short-billed species were the Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea); the only long-billed species was the Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa). We found that the groups of plant species pollinated by the long- and short-billed birds differed significantly in floral tube length. Short-billed sunbirds nevertheless often robbed long-tubed flowers by piercing the corolla, and there was a significant difference in floral tube length among those species that were robbed, and those that were pollinated by short-billed sunbirds. The presence of territorial Malachite Sunbirds depressed robbing rates by short-billed sunbirds at long-tubed flowers. In turn, the absence of Malachite Sunbirds from short-tubed plant species might be explained by the observed positive correlation between tube length and nectar volume. Together, these data suggest that there is a subset of the bird-pollinated plants at the Cape that are pollinated solely by the long-billed Malachite Sunbird, a pollination service irreplaceable by the more abundant, short-billed sunbird species. To extrapolate this finding to a greater subset of species in the Cape Floral Region, we measured flowers on herbarium specimens of all tubular putatively bird-pollinated plants. We find that floral tube length has a bimodal distribution with 37 Cape species potentially dependent on pollination by Malachite Sunbirds. © 2009 SAAB.",Floral tube length; Long-billed bird pollination; Malachite Sunbird; Nectar robbing; Nectar sugar; Nectarinia famosa,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350566802

Here we report the discovery of pollination by flower chafer beetles (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae) in two color forms of E. ensata and in E. welwitschii. Both species have congested, capitate inflorescences, traits that are generally associated with pollination by flower chafer beetles in Eulophia and other plant genera. Pollinarium reconfiguration, including pollinarium bending and anther cap retention, in these beetle-pollinated species is slow. Such slow reconfiguration is predicted by Darwin's hypothesis to be a mechanism that limits geitonogamous self-pollination by slow moving beetles. A breeding system experiment conducted on E. welwitschii showed that this species, like most others in the genus, is self-compatible, but is dependent on pollinators for fruit set. As all Eulophia species are non-rewarding, the basis of attraction of beetles to flowers of the study species seems to be the generalized resemblance of their inflorescence in terms of flower arrangement and color to the capitula of sympatric rewarding Asteraceae that are utilized as food or rendezvous sites (or both) by flower chafer beetles. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Given that both herbivores and pollinators consume and are dependent upon plant-derived nutrients and secondary metabolites, and utilize plant signals, plant chemistry should be one of the major factors mediating these interactions. 3. Here we build upon a conceptual framework for understanding plant-mediated interactions of pollinators and herbivores. We focus on plant chemistry, in particular plant volatiles and aim to unify hypotheses for plant defence and pollination. We make predictions for the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions by hypothesizing that conflicting selection pressures from herbivores and pollinators arise from the constraints imposed by plant chemistry. 4. We further hypothesize that plants could avoid conflicts between pollinator attraction and herbivore defence through tissue-specific regulation of pollinator reward chemistry, as well as herbivore-induced changes in flower chemistry and morphology. 5. Finally, we test aspects of our predictions in a case study using a wild tomato species, Solanum peruvianum, to illustrate the diversity of tissue-specific and herbivore-induced differences in plant chemistry that could influence herbivore and pollinator behaviour, and plant fitness. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Coevolution; Induced responses to herbivory; Plant defences; Plant-insect interactions; Pollinator limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349320375

Here we further document exclusive insect-pollination in Aloe minima and A. linearifolia, two short-tubed summer flowering aloes in the grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Despite sunbirds being present in the study area, only bee species were observed to visit and pollinate these two aloes. There was little difference in seed set between bird-excluded and open-pollinated treatments, indicating that bee visitors are effective as pollinators of these two species. In a few cases, a single visit by a bee was enough for successful fertilization. Other floral traits, including UV reflectance, small quantities of concentrated nectar, and the presence of floral scent (associated with pollination by insects), strengthen the argument for evolutionary specialization for exclusive insect-pollination in certain species of Aloe. © 2009 SAAB.",Aloe; Apidae; Asphodelaceae; Grassland; Pollination; Southern Africa,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350573046

Do species with longer styles exhibit greater inequalities in seed siring success among pollen donors? Does increased gametophytic competition (i.e. higher ratio of pollen load size to ovule number) lead to greater inequality in seed siring success among pollen donors? Are particular life-history traits (i.e. animal- vs. wind-pollinated species or wild vs. cultivated species) associated with greater inequality in seed siring among pollen donors? Data incorporated: I summarize the results of 51 studies that assessed the paternity of seeds produced following experimental pollinations in which pollen grains from two or more compatible donors competed for ovule fertilization. Method of analysis: Data from multiple studies were combined to determine the effects of style length, ratio of pollen load size to ovule number, and life-history traits on the degree of non-random mating among compatible mates. Conclusions: Style length had the strongest association with non-random mating. Surprisingly, species with shorter styles exhibited a significantly greater inequality in seed siring success among pollen donors.

The discovery of a large, well-pollinated population of H. epipactidea in the Eastern Cape allowed us to confirm the presence of this unusual pollen placement on a number of species of shorter-tongued hawkmoths. The long-tongued species Agrius convolvuli is likely to function as a nectar thief as the length of the tongue of this species relative to the nectar spur ensures that the forelegs are unlikely to come into contact with the viscidia. The legitimate hawkmoth pollinators removed a large proportion of pollinaria from the flowers and the majority of flowers had pollen deposited on their stigmas. Despite this, pollen transfer efficiency was relatively low at 8.4%. We also examined the scent production of H. epipactidea and show that volatile production increases markedly after 18:00, peaking at around 20:00. The scent of this species is dominated by methyl benzoate which makes up 99.4% of the floral scent at 20:00.

Inflorescences were placed in wire and shade-cloth exclosures and seed-set compared to controls in the field. Otomys irroratus, Aethomys namaquensis, Rhabdomys pumilio and Myomyscus (Praomys) verreauxi were captured and all tested positive for the presence of protea pollen. All, except O. irroratus, displayed legitimate pollination of P. nana. Myomyscus verreauxi was regarded as the most competent pollinator as it displayed superior climbing ability in comparison to the other rodent species. R. pumilio sometimes displayed highly destructive behaviour of P. nana inflorescences and is the likely explanation for the observed 20% reduction in average number of inflorescences per plant over a two month period.

A breeding system study revealed that Sisyrinchium is self- incompatible, potentially increasing its vulnerability to competition for pollination. Interspecific competition for pollinator visits occurred, as visit rates were lower for Sisyrinchium near Euphorbia than for Sisyrinchium more than 10 m from Euphorbia. However, supplemental hand pollinations of Sisyrinchium did not increase fruit or seed set either near to or far from Euphorbia, indicating that visits were not limiting. More than one- third of Sisyrinchium stigmas received Euphorbia pollen, but hand-pollination experiments detected no effect of Euphorbia pollen receipt on fruit or seed set, whether Euphorbia pollen was applied immediately or 2 h before application of Sisyrinchium pollen. Overall, this study suggests that Euphorbia does not reduce Sisyrinchium's pollination success despite competing for pollinator visits and being a source of heterospecific pollen on Sisyrinchium stigmas. © 2009, American Midland Naturalist.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649248757

'Orri' has an excellent taste, the rind is deep orange in color and easily removed, and it contains few or no seeds. However, 'Orri' grown in Israel suffers from inadequate yield and no published studies have yet addressed this problem. In the present study we determined that 'Orri' productivity depended on conditions being favorable to cross-pollination. Under cross-pollination conditions a positive correlation (R2 = 0.97) was found between yield per tree and number of fruits per tree, and more than 90% of the fruits exceeded 60 mm: the most profitable size range. These data suggest that the number of fruits per tree, and not fruit size, is the limiting factor for yield improvement in 'Orri' orchards. Studying seed set showed that 'Michal' mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) is a compatible pollenizer for 'Orri' flowers: the number of seeds per 'Orri' fruit increased as the distance from 'Michal' trees decreased.

We investigated this problem in the African milkweed Pachycarpus grandiflorus which has open flowers that produce copious amounts of exposed and concentrated nectar, yet is visited almost exclusively by spider-hunting wasps in the genus hemipepsis. 3. These wasps were the only visitors found to consistently carry pollinaria and a cage experiment showed that they are capable of successfully pollinating this plant. Furthermore, experimental hand-pollinations showed that P. grandiflorus is genetically self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinators for seed set. 4. We investigated the roles of chemical (nectar and floral scent) and spectral properties in the selective attraction of wasps and the filtering out of other potential flower visitors. Nectar palatability experiments showed that the nectar is unpalatable to honeybees but palatable to the wasps. Choice experiments conducted in the field and using a Y-maze in the laboratory showed that wasps are attracted primarily by scent rather than visual cues. Analysis of scent using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry showed that these inflorescences produce 36 different compounds, mostly monoterpenes and aliphatics. Analysis of spectral reflectance showed that flowers have similar colouring to the background vegetation. 5. We conclude that P. grandiflorus is specialized for pollination by Hemipepsis wasps, and in the absence of morphological filters, achieves specialization through unpalatable nectar, cryptic colouring and scent as a selective pollinator attractant. 6.

Here we provide a survey of the frequency and abundance of yeasts in floral nectar from 40 taxonomically diverse South African plant species, test whether they affect nectar properties, and investigate associations between yeast incidence and pollinator type. Microscopical observations of nectar samples revealed that yeasts are widespread in floral nectar of South African species, as revealed by the high percentage of plants (51.3%) and flowers (43.2%) containing those microbes, and that when present, they can reach high densities (up to 3.6 × 106 yeast cells/mm3 in Moraea graminicola). Further, a significant negative correlation was found between yeast density and sugar content (Rs = - 0.463, P = 0.039) and yeast density and nectar concentration (Rs = - 0.470, P = 0.037) in a Watsonia species. Interestingly, variation in yeast incidence among plant species was related to differences in pollinator type, in such a way that the plant species pollinated by birds showed the highest proportion of plants and flowers with yeasts, while those visited only by Hymenoptera showed the lowest values. Our study confirms the ubiquity of nectarivorous yeasts in plant communities and identifies novel ways of approaching the study of nectar characteristics and exciting new perspectives on the role of yeasts in plant-pollinator relationships. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the existence of a pollination system involving opportunistic nectarivores in Kniphofia caulescens, a high altitude member of a genus previously considered to contain only sunbird- and insect-adapted pollination systems. Plants of K. caulescens set approximately twice as many fruits and produced more seeds per fruit when exposed to both bird and insect pollination than to just insect pollination. Controlled pollination experiments showed that the species is genetically self-incompatible and thus totally reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Opportunistic nectar-feeding birds appear to be the most important pollinators of this plant. In particular, Drakensberg Siskins (Crithagra symonsi) and Yellow Canaries (Crithagra flaviventris) were the most frequent visitors and carried the highest pollen loads. The Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa), although often feeding on Kniphofia caulescens, carried very little pollen, presumably on account of its long bill which reduces contact between the floral anthers and its head feathers. Honey bees were also frequent flower visitors and made a secondary contribution to fruit set. Flowers of K. caulescens contained copious amounts (c. 30 ?l) of very dilute (c. 9%) hexose-rich nectar which is consistent with the pollination syndrome found in plants pollinated by opportunistic avian nectarivores. © 2009 SAAB.",Bird pollination; Breeding system; Drakensberg; Drakensberg Siskin; Honeybee; Nectar; Sugar composition,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350573617

Despite the conceptual importance of pollination syndromes, few macroevolutionary studies have statistically examined the relationship between pollinators and floral traits. Using 15 species of Iochroma, Smith et al. applied phylogenetically structured correlation analyses to test the relationship between floral variation and pollination system, quantified in terms of the importance of major pollinator groups. This study revealed that pollinator shifts are tied to changes in nectar reward and floral display but are not significantly correlated with changes in corolla length or color, contrary to what might be predicted from classical pollination syndromes. Fenster et al. question these findings because our pollinator importance estimates included recently introduced honey bees. To address this concern, we recalculated importance values excluding honey bees and repeated the analyses. We found the same patterns as in our original study with significant correlations between pollinators and nectar reward and display.

Reproductive isolation in Ophrys is based on the selective attraction of only a single pollinator species. A change of floral odour can result in the attraction of a new pollinator species that acts as an isolation barrier towards other sympatrically occurring Ophrys species. Ophrys lupercalis, Ophrys bilunulata, and Ophrys fabrella grow sympatrically and bloom consecutively on Majorca and are pollinated by three species of Andrena. We investigated variation of phenotypic and genotypic flower traits, aiming to study the role of the floral odour for reproductive isolation and speciation. Using chemical and electrophysiology (gas chromatography coupled with an electroantennographic detector) methods, we show that the three Ophrys species use the same odour compounds for pollinator attraction, but in different proportions. A comparison of the floral odour bouquets in a multivariate analysis revealed a clear grouping of plants from the same species, although with an overlap between species. A comparison of the same plants using molecular markers gave a contrasting result. Although O. lupercalis and O. fabrella were genetically well separated, plants of O. bilunulata did not form a distinct group but were similar to either O. lupercalis or O. fabrella. Our data indicate gene flow and hybridization to occur between O. bilunulata and O. lupercalis as well as between O. bilunulata and O. fabrella. All plants of O. bilunulata, despite having different genotypes, showed a very similar floral odour. This reflects a strong selective pressure by the pollinating males. The overlap of genotypes of O. bilunulata and O. fabrella supports our hypothesis that O. fabrella diverged from O. bilunulata by scent variation and the attraction of a new pollinator species, Andrena fabrella. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",AFLP; Floral odour; Hybridization; Ophrys; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349220829

Here, we present the results of extensive field work on twenty-one wildflower species with large, showy flowers, belonging to a broad range of angiosperm families. Most of the plant species investigated were found to be self-incompatible and therefore completely dependent on pollinators. Based on over 250 h of field observations during which we recorded over 1000 individual insects, 368 of which were examined for pollen loads, we identified pollination systems involving, inter alia, bees and flies (both short- and long-tongued), wasps, butterflies, hawkmoths, beetles, and sunbirds.

Yet, few studies have examined experimentally the independent and interactive effects of different aspects of flower morphology on plant reproductive success. In the orchid Platanthera bifolia, perianth size and spur length are positively correlated within and among populations. To test the hypothesis that pollination success and seed output increases with increasing perianth size and spur length, we manipulated the two traits in a factorial design in a long-spurred population of P. bifolia pollinated by long-tongued hawkmoths. Additionally, to determine whether differences in selfing rate can explain variation in fruit set and fruit size, we performed controlled self- and cross-pollination. Plants with long spurs had more flowers pollinated, more pollen removed and produced more and larger fruits compared to plants with short spurs. In contrast, perianth size did not affect the pollination success or fruit production of P. bifolia. Fruit production and fruit size did not differ among flowers pollinated with self- and cross pollen, respectively. This indicates that reduced pollen deposition rather than pollinator-mediated self-pollination caused the reduction in fruit set and fruit volume observed after shortening of the spur. The results demonstrate that spur length, but not perianth size, is critical for reproductive success in P. bifolia, and suggest that among-population differentiation in perianth size may reflect a correlated response to selection on spur length. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that visual display is less important than other cues for the reproductive success of P. bifolia, and underscore the necessity to experimentally examine the functional significance of putatively adaptive traits. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Floral display; Floral evolution; Flower morphology; Pollen removal; Pollination success; Seed output,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349304189

Despite the importance of pollinators, and their contribution to the global food supply, little is known about how they are affected by transgenic crops. Pollinator preferences affect plant mating patterns; thus understanding the effects of transgenic crops on pollinators will aid in understanding transgene movement. 2. Honey bee and squash bee visit number and duration were recorded on conventional and transgenic virus-resistant squash Cucurbita pepo planted in a randomized block design. Floral characters were measured to explain differences in pollinator behaviour. The effect of Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus infection on pollinator behaviour was also examined. 3. Honey bees visited female conventional flowers more than female transgenic flowers. Conventional flowers were generally larger with more nectar than transgenic flowers, although floral traits did not account for differences in pollinator visitation. 4. Squash bees visited male transgenic flowers more than male conventional flowers; squash bees also spent more time in female transgenic flowers than in female conventional flowers. Transgenic flowers were significantly larger with greater amounts of sweeter nectar and they were present in greater number. Floral traits accounted for some of the variation in pollinator visitation. 5. Squash bee visit number and duration did not differ between virus-infected and healthy plants, but this may be because pollinator behaviour was observed early in the virus infection. 6. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator behaviour controls patterns of plant mating thus non-target effects of transgenic resistance, such as those observed here, may influence transgene movement into wild populations. These results suggest that transgenic crops should not be planted within the native range of wild relatives because pleiotropic effects may affect crop-wild hybridization and transgene introgression into wild populations. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Apis mellifera; Cucurbita pepo; Genetically modified organism; GMO; Peponapis; Plant virus; Xenoglossa; Zucchini yellow mosaic virus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349653510

The popularity of kousa dogwood has increased in recent years as a result of its resistance to dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew as compared with flowering dogwood, which is typically susceptible to those diseases. This range of resistance allows the development of intraand interspecific cultivars with multiple disease resistance or a combination of disease resistance and specific ornamental traits. Breeding requires controlled crosses that are usually done manually, which is a labor-intensive process. Cornus florida and C. kousa have generally been found to be self-incompatible allowing for the breeding process to be made more efficient by not having to emasculate flowers. We have capitalized on the natural ability of honeybees and the self-incompatible nature of dogwood to perform self- and crosspollinations of flowering and kousa dogwood. Self-pollinations were conducted in 2006 and 2007 with C. florida 'Appalachian Spring' and 'Cherokee Brave' and with C. kousa 'Blue Shadow' and Galilean. The flowering dogwood self-pollinations resulted in no seed production, whereas the kousa dogwood self-pollinations resulted in low seed production, indicating self-incompatibility. Intra- and interspecific crosses of flowering and kousa dogwood cultivars and breeding lines were conducted in 2006 to 2008. Honeybees were effective in facilitating seed production for all intraspecific crosses conducted. Seedling phenotypes of putative intra- and interspecific hybrids are similar and practically indistinguishable, so dogwood-specific simple sequence repeats were used to verify a sample of the putative hybrids. The results demonstrated that honeybees were effective in performing controlled pollinations and that honeybee-mediated pollinations provide an alternative to time-consuming hand pollinations for flowering and kousa dogwood.",Flowering dogwood; Kousa dogwood; Pollen; Scanning electron microscopy; Self-incompatibility; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350424127

This contribution represents a study on recent trends in the principal meteorological parameters in these areas and their influence on the phenology of Urticaceae (nettle family) atmospheric pollen, one of the main causes of pollinosis in Spain. The study covers the period 1991-2006 for Malaga and 1995-2005 for Vigo, and compares the differences in climate and phenological behaviour observed at both localities. The sampling of atmospheric pollen was performed with Hirst volumetric pollen traps. The two localities present different tendencies as far as temperature is concerned: while the mean annual temperature in the Mediterranean region has increased by 0.06°C/year, the same parameter has decreased in the Atlantic area by 0.1°C/year. This tendency is even more pronounced as far as the minimum temperatures are concerned, especially during spring in Malaga and autumn in Vigo. On the other hand, wind speed has tended to increase, periods of calm have diminished and winds blowing off the sea have increased in both places. These changes in meteorological parameters have advanced the end of the pollen season in Malaga and delayed its start in Vigo. Total annual pollen counts have decreased in Vigo, while the number of pollen-free days has increased in both areas. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350712269

By measuring the length of all stamens and pistils in inflorescences and the reference growth rate of pistils, we constructed growth curves of pistils and stamens between stages 12 and 15 of flower development. Pistil growth was found to consist of a single exponential growth, while stamen growth consisted of three exponential phases. During the second exponential phase, the growth rate of stamen filaments was ?10 times greater than the growth rates in the other two phases. Consequently, stamens whose growth was initially retarded grew longer than the pistil, putting pollen grains on the stigma. msg2-1 stamens, on the other hand, exhibited a less obvious growth increase, resulting in less frequent contact between anthers and stigma. MSG2 was expressed in the stamen filaments and its expression almost coincided with the second growth phase. Stamen filaments appeared to elongate by cell elongation rather than cell division in the epidermal cell file. Considering that MSG2 is likely to be a direct target of the auxin F-box receptors, MSG2 may be one of the master genes that control the transient growth increase of stamen filaments. © Physiologia Plantarum 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349159462

Classification of the oak trees into species was performed using canonical discriminant analysis of a range of leaf morphological traits. Adult trees (365) and offspring (582) were genotyped with eight microsatellite markers. Seedlings were sampled in 2003 and acorns were collected in 2004.  Mating patterns of Q. robur and Q. petraea are expected to be different in the northern range of the distribution area and a larger hybridization rate is expected. It is further expected, that pollination from outside sources will be relatively less in small fragmented forest management systems compared to large scale oak forest. The conclusions should be verified through repeated year to year analysis of the mating pattern.  Phenological studies revealed that there was no difference in flowering time between species. Data for the adult trees revealed no significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions and there was weak, but significant spatial genetic structure, which supports the idea that the stand is of natural origin. Spatial genetic structure in the first distance class is stronger for Q. petraea. The genetic composition of the offspring was remarkably consistent from year to year. Paternity analysis revealed that, on average, 85% pollination came from fathers within the stand. The direction of the pollen flow varied from year to year. Inter-specific hybridization was high and ranged from 15-17% and from 48-55% for Q. petraea and Q. robur mothers respectively. Paternity analysis revealed that the population was basically outcrossing and only 3.7% of the analysed progeny were the product of selfing. Over the two years of study, approximately 200 trees contributed to the paternity of the next generations.  The study confirms earlier studies with a greater tendency for Q. robur mothers to produce hybrid seeds than Q. petraea mothers. The rate of hybridization is higher in this Danish stand than in comparable studies elsewhere in Europe.

I provide further support for this hypothesis by showing that states with the largest areas of open land have a significantly higher honey yield on a per colony basis.

Inland sand dunes and dry, oligotrophic grasslands have become rare habitat types in large parts of Central Europe and their restoration and management is of major importance for the preservation of many endangered plant and insect species. Within such habitats, it is important to restore key ecosystem services, such as pollination networks. As wild bees are the most important pollinators in many ecosystems, they represent a suitable key group to evaluate restoration measures. Furthermore, the recent decline of many bee species and the potential ecological and economic consequences are currently topics of strong scientific interest. We studied the succession of bee communities in response to restoration measures of sand dunes and sand grasslands and compared these communities with those of old sand dune complexes. Our results show that wild bees respond rapidly to restoration measures indicated by a high species richness and abundance. The community structure of bees at restoration sites converged only slightly to those of the target sites. A higher similarity was found between bee communities at the restoration sites (sand dunes and grasslands), indicating that their close proximity was an important determinant of species overlap. Environmental factors such as the number of entomophilous plant species and moisture had a strong influence on wild bee species composition. Synthesis and applications. The restoration of inland sand dune complexes provides opportunities for colonization by a diverse wild bee community. Although it is difficult to establish a given target community, restoration measures gave rise to a high pollinator diversity and abundance, suggesting that community function can be re-established. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Colonization; Community structure; Grassland management; Pollination; Succession,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349705609

The present study aims to describe the anatomical organization and ultrastructure of the pericarpial nectaries (PNs) in Erythrina speciosa, a bird-pollinated species, discussing functional aspects of these unusual structures.MethodsSamples of floral buds, ovaries of flowers at anthesis and fruits at several developmental stages were fixed and processed by the usual methods for studies using light, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Nectar samples collected by filter paper wicks were subjected to chemical analysis using thin-layer chromatography.Key ResultsThe PNs are distributed in isolation on the exocarp. Each PN is represented by a single hyaline trichome that consists of a basal cell at epidermal level, stalk cell(s) and a small secretory multicellular head. The apical stalk cell shows inner periclinal and anticlinal walls impregnated by lipids and lignin and has dense cytoplasm with a prevalence of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The secretory cells show voluminous nuclei and dense cytoplasm, which predominantly has dictyosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, plastids, mitochondria and free ribosomes. At the secretory stage the periplasmic space is prominent and contains secretion residues. Tests for sugar indicate the presence of non-reducing sugars in the secretory cells. Nectar samples from PNs contained sucrose, glucose and fructose.ConclusionsThe secretory stage of these PNs extends until fruit maturation and evidence suggests that the energetic source of nectar production is based on pericarp photosynthesis. Patrolling ants were seen foraging on fruits during all stages of fruit development, which suggests that the PNs mediate a symbiotic relationship between ants and plant, similar to the common role of many extrafloral nectaries.",Ant-plant interactions; Erythrina speciosa; Fabaceae; Faboideae; Fruit anatomy; Nectar secretion; Nectary; Post-floral nectaries,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349600349

Zygomorphy evolved once in Ranunculaceae, in the speciose and derived tribe Delphinieae. This tribe consists of two genera (Aconitum and Delphinium s.l.) comprising more than one-quarter of the species of the family. In this paper, the establishment of zygomorphy during development was investigated to cast light on the origin and evolution of this morphological novelty.MethodsThe floral developmental sequence of six species of Ranunculaceae, three actinomorphic (Nigella damascena, Aquilegia alpina and Clematis recta) and three zygomorphic (Aconitum napellus, Delphinium staphisagria and D. grandiflorum), was compared. A developmental model was elaborated to break down the successive acquisitions of floral organ identities on the ontogenic spiral (all the species studied except Aquilegia have a spiral phyllotaxis), giving clues to understanding this complex morphogenesis from an evo-devo point of view. In addition, the evolution of symmetry in Ranunculaceae was examined in conjunction with other traits of flowers and with ecological factors.Key ResultsIn the species studied, zygomorphy is established after organogenesis is completed, and is late, compared with other zygomorphic eudicot species. Zygomorphy occurs in flowers characterized by a fixed merism and a partially reduced and transformed corolla.ConclusionsIt is suggested that shifts in expression of genes controlling the merism, as well as floral symmetry and organ identity, have played a critical role in the evolution of zygomorphy in Delphinieae, while the presence of pollinators able to exploit the peculiar morphology of the flower has been a key factor for the maintenance and diversification of this trait.",Delphinieae; Development; Evo-devo; Evolution; Nectar spurs; Ontogenic spiral; Ranunculaceae; Zygomorphy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349606100

Despite the presence of such structures few studies have demonstrated their efficacy in limiting the nectar intake by nectar thieves. The flowers of Strelitzia reginae are regularly visited by sunbirds that do not effect pollination and act solely as nectar thieves. In this species, the nectary is covered by the convoluted bases of the petals (""nectar barriers""). In this study we investigate how non-pollinating sunbirds interact with these nectar barriers and whether nectar barriers play a role in limiting the amount of nectar sunbirds can steal. We quantified the volume of nectar that sunbirds consume while visiting flowers where nectar barriers were present and in flowers where these were experimentally removed. We found that sunbirds consume a median of 106.8 ?l of nectar when visiting flowers with nectar barriers present and consumed a significantly greater volume of nectar (median = 158.03 ?l) in flowers without nectar barriers. These results suggest that the convoluted petals that cover the nectary of S. reginae may function to reduce nectar theft but are likely to be more effective against insect nectar thieves. This is one of the first studies to quantitatively demonstrate the role of flower features that may function to limit nectar theft. © 2009 SAAB.",Nectar theft; Robbery; Strelitzia reginae; Sunbirds,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350572452

While there have been reports that duration of receptivity of syconia can be prolonged in response to pollinator limitation, the effect of pollination rate on the duration of phenological phases over a year has not been examined. Percentage of unpollinated syconia, number of foundresses per pollinated syconium, duration of receptivity, frequency of single-sex broods, crop size, frequency of parasitisation, persistence of ripe syconia, and mass abscission were recorded for Ficus superba at the crop level. Percentage of unpollinated syconia is significantly negatively correlated with the number of foundresses per syconium, and positively correlated with the duration of receptivity, and the persistence of ripe syconia. Despite the absence of sesonality in reproduction, the occurrences of receptive syconia and ripe syconia showed unimodal and bimodal peaks, respectively, owing to prolongment of these phases. This is attributable to meteorological factors, which are hypothesized to influence pollinator dispersal, or population dynamics, and thus pollination rate. This highlights the overlooked significance of pollinator, and possibly frugivore phenology in accounting for Ficus reproduction, and suggests that while reproduction may be aseasonal, reproductive potential may not be. Furthermore, crop size was shown to affect the number of foundresses per syconium, duration of receptivity, and persistence of ripe syconia.

In this study, we investigated the value of hedgerows as foraging habitat for native bees in mosaics of small-scale agriculture and natural vegetation in two riparian landscapes in southeast Arizona, USA. In the summers of 2002 and 2003, we surveyed bees and flowers in four habitats: hedgerows, agricultural fields, woodlots, and native woodland. We asked: (1) How do hedgerows compare to other available habitats in bee abundance and species richness? (2) How does bee species composition in hedgerows compare to species composition in agricultural fields and woodland? (3) How do flower resources in hedgerows compare to those in fields and woodland? We found that hedgerows were attractive foraging habitat for native bees, especially in early summer, when hedgerows tended to have higher species richness than other agricultural or natural habitats. Cumulative species richness was highest in agricultural fields, although cumulative species richness did not significantly differ among fields, hedgerows, and woodland. While bee faunas overlapped among habitats, bee assemblages in hedgerows were more similar to those in woodland than to those in fields. The hedgerow herbaceous flora was roughly intermediate to that of fields and woodland; hedgerows also supported high densities of woodland-characteristic shrubs. These flowering shrubs were important in attracting bees that were otherwise uncommon in the landscape, including some species that are potentially valuable pollinators of agricultural crops. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a 34-yr record of flowering times and flower abundance for four species (two Delphinium [Ranunculaceae] species and two Mertensia [Boraginaceae] species) from a subalpine plant community near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to test the hypothesis that the phenologies of early-flowering species change more rapidly in response to climatological and other abiotic cues than do late-flowering species, a pattern previously found in plant communities in North America and Europe. We also explored a related hypothesis, that flower abundance of late-flowering species is more responsive to changes in climate than that of early-flowering species. The Delphinium species did not support these hypotheses, but the Mertensia species did. The difference between the peak flowering times of the early and late Mertensia species is expanding, leading to a period of diminished resources for pollinators that specialize on this genus. Mertensia ciliata populations are already severely declining in our study area, possibly as a result of earlier snowmelt. Together, these results show that the reported differences between early and late-flowering species may be widespread, but they are not ubiquitous.",Boraginaceae; Climate change; Delphinium; Flower abundance; Flowering phenology; Frost; Global warming; Mertensia; Ranunculaceae; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Snowmelt,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349897463

However, the contribution of minor genes endowing substantial plant survival at sublethal herbicide doses may be a potential complementary path to herbicide resistance evolution in weed populations under selection. Here, we subjected a number of susceptible individuals of Lolium rigidum to recurrent glyphosate selection to test the potential for sublethal glyphosate doses to additively select for glyphosate resistance. After 3-4 cycles of glyphosate selection in two distinct environments, the progenies of the initially susceptible population were shifted toward glyphosate resistance. The results indicate progressive enrichment of minor gene trait(s) contributing toward plant survival in the glyphosate-selected progenies. After three generations of selection, the estimated LD 50 values were doubled compared with the original population and up to 33% plant survival was obtained in the glyphosate-selected progeny at the recommended glyphosate label rate. This level of resistance probably was the maximum shift achievable with sublethal glyphosate dose selection in this small population. Cross-pollination was a crucial factor enabling the rapid rate of accumulation of minor glyphosate resistance gene trait(s) that are likely to be present at a relatively high frequency in a small susceptible population. The mechanistic basis of the moderate glyphosate resistance level selected by sublethal glyphosate doses remains unknown and warrants future research.

It has been hypothesized to reduce the gender conflict inherent in hermaphrodite flowers. In particular, the reciprocal arrangement of male and female parts promotes precise pollen transfer between morphs, and the heteromorphic incompatibility system that is associated with distyly can eliminate uniparental inbreeding depression. We studied the syndrome of floral traits associated with distyly in Sebaea grandis, a perennial herb common in South African grasslands. Flowers have the reciprocal reproductive organ arrangement characteristic of the distylous syndrome, and L- and S-morphs occurred at equal frequencies in the two populations that were studied. S- and L-morph flowers did not differ significantly in size, although the S-morph produced larger pollen grains and pollen exine sculpturing differed between the two morphs. Approximately 80% of the pollen deposited on the stigmas of either morph was legitimate (intermorph), suggesting that distyly in this species promotes cross-pollination. A controlled pollination experiment suggests that S. grandis possesses a heteromophic incompatibility system: no fruits were produced following intramorph pollinations, whereas intermorph pollinations resulted in 70% of flowers setting fruit.

In Tritoniopsis revoluta, an irid with a very long corolla tube conforming to the long proboscid fly pollination syndrome, we determine visitation rates of bees and long proboscid flies, as well as ascertain whether bees could be important pollen vectors in this system. We confirmed the presence of extremely long proboscid Prosoeca longipennis flies in one T. revoluta population, but found that fly visitation was absent in most populations. Instead, we found that in the absence of flies, nectar wells up the corolla tubes and becomes accessible to Amegilla bees, which were the most frequent visitors to T. revoluta at most sites and carried pollen, suggesting they could effect pollination. The highest bee visitation rates were in T. revoluta populations with unusually short tubed plants, where nectar was more accessible than in plants with long corolla tubes. Short tubed populations with more bee activity had higher average seed set than long tubed populations, suggesting that bees might contribute significantly to fitness in this apparently long-proboscid fly pollinated plant. Although these results do not support the use of syndromes for predicting all of a flower's important pollinators, they do support the idea that floral morphology will be shaped by the most effective pollinators at the time. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This transition is often, but not always, accompanied by the evolution of sexual dimorphism in attractive traits, and floral scent is no exception. In this review I aim to improve our understanding of variation in sexual dimorphism in floral scent characteristics by first explicating the relevant hypotheses, and then deriving explicit predictions for the pattern of floral scent from each. Next, I synthesize and qualitatively review published data on floral volatile emission rate and composition in 33 gender dimorphic species to identify emerging patterns, and evaluate these in light of predictions derived from the hypotheses. Although conclusions must be viewed as preliminary, a handful of strong patterns were revealed: (1) in the majority of the species studied males emit more volatiles per flower than females, (2) in over half of the species studied the sexes differed in at least one aspect of scent composition, (3) sexual dimorphism in scent composition was less common in species with rewardless females and/or brood site pollination than those that offered nectar and/or pollen, (4) a one-to-one correspondence between sex differences in overall scent composition and male organ-specific scent production is largely not found. This review has highlighted gaps in our understanding of the genesis of patterns of sexual dimorphism in floral scent, and makes clear that to move the field forward we need to shift our focus from pattern to process, and this will be best achieved by simultaneously testing alternative hypotheses at the same level of analysis. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Allometry; Dioecy; Floral volatiles; Genetic constraints; Gynodioecy; Insect pollination; Mimicry; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349334506

This aids, in turn, the estimation of the appropriate population sizes needed to maintain both genetic and species' diversity. Little is known about plant reproductive biology in the Monte Desert (Patagonia, Argentina), a habitat threatened by desertification as a result of human impact. The mating systems, flowering phenologies and pollinator networks were studied in five representative plant species of the Monte Desert. The mating systems studied ranged from anemophilous pollen dispersion in the dioecious Atriplex lampa, to a gradient of dependence on pollinators, from the less dependent (facultative self-compatible) Gutierrezia solbrigii and two Larrea spp. (L. divaricata and L. cuneifolia) to the most dependent Grindelia chiloensis (self-incompatible). Flowering phenology was restricted to spring and coincided with pollinator abundance. Solitary bees were the main pollinator group, but beetles, flies and butterflies were also important. The four insect-pollinated species were moderately generalist, but they maintained their own pollinator assemblage. Coleopterans depended more on Grindelia chiloensis and dipterans on Gutierrezia solbrigii. Lepidopterans frequently visited Gutierrezia solbrigii and Larrea divaricata, whereas hymenopterans visited both Larrea spp. more frequently. The studied plant species are ecologically important, not only as resources for a wide range of pollinator species but also for other insects. The Monte Desert is a very disturbance-sensitive environment and, as these plant species hardly show vegetative regeneration, sexual reproduction is essential for their survival. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",Flowering phenology; Hand pollination; Mating systems; Pollination ecology; Pollinator network,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350214667

Some species show very high rates of respiration through the alternative pathway, and some are thermoregulatory, with increasing respiration at decreasing ambient temperature. This study assesses the intensity and regulation of respiration in three species of African Hydnora that represent the Hydnoraceae, an unusual family of holoparasitic plants from arid environments.MethodsLong-term respirometry (CO2 production) and thermometry were carried out on intact flowers of H. africana, H. abyssinica and H. esculenta in the field, and short-term measurements were made on floral parts during the protogynous flowering sequence.Key ResultsFor H. africana, there was no temperature elevation in either the osmophores or the gynoecial chamber in any phase, and mass-specific respiration rates of the flower parts were low (maximum 8·3 nmol CO2 g-1 s-1 in osmophore tissue). Respiration tracked ambient and floral temperatures, eliminating the possibility of the inverse relationship expected in thermoregulatory flowers. Hydnora abyssinica flowers had higher respiration (maximum 27·5 nmol g -1 s-1 in the osmophores) and a slight elevation of osmophore temperature (maximum 2·8 °C) in the female stage. Respiration by gynoecial tissue was similar to that of osmophores in both species, but there was no measurable elevation of gynoecial chamber temperature. Gynoecial chamber temperature of H. esculenta could reach 3·8 °C above ambient, but there are no respiration data available. Antheral tissue respiration was maximal in the male phase (4·8 nmol g-1 s -1 in H. africana and 10·3 nmol g-1 s-1 in H. abyssinica), but it did not raise the antheral ring temperature, which showed that thermogenesis is not a by-product of pollen maturation or release.ConclusionsThe exceptionally low thermogenesis in Hydnora appears to be associated with scent production and possibly gynoecial development, but has little direct benefit to beetle pollinators.",Flowers; Hydnora; Insects; Pollination biology; Respiration rate; Temperature; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349604424

To understand the developmental mechanisms that might underlie this change in flower shape, and associated change in pollination syndrome, we analyzed the role of CYC-like genes in P. lanceolata. Related zygomorphic species have two CYC-like genes that are expressed asymmetrically in the dorsal region of young floral meristems and in developing flowers, where they affect the rate of development of dorsal petals and stamens. Plantago has a single CYC-like gene (PlCYC) that is not expressed in early floral meristems and there is no apparent asymmetry in the pattern of PlCYC expression during later flower development. Thus, the evolution of actinomorphy in Plantago correlates with loss of dorsal-specific CYC-like gene function. PlCYC is expressed in the inflorescence stem, in pedicels, and relatively late in stamen development, suggesting a novel role for PlCYC in compacting the inflorescence and retarding stamen elongation in this wind pollinated species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",CYCLOIDEA; Flower shape; Plantago; Protogyny; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249220105

In 2004 and 2005, 690 pollen traps were arranged at different locations relative to three maize fields: in the maize fields itself, and in fields adjacent to the maize fields, consisting either of grassland or wheat stubble. The traps were positioned along strings over maize, wheat stubble and grassland at two fixed heights relative to the maize plants: immediately above (0 m) and 1 m above tassel height (1 m). Whereas the traps positioned at 0 m over maize indicated the amount of pollen shed, those located at 1 m above tassel height indicated airborne pollen flow to this upper air layer. The amount of pollen at 1 m relative to the amount of pollen just above the tassel, ranged from 4% to 40%; very high values correlated with strong winds during flowering. These winds were not strong enough to transport significant amounts of pollen farther than a few meters away from the pollen source because above both adjacent grass and wheat stubble environments, the amount of pollen at 1 m above tassel height was similarly low. In one single experiment and at 0 m above tassel height, a significantly higher amount of pollen was found over wheat stubble than over grassland. During this experiment, high temperatures and low wind speeds coincided with pollen shed, which may have favored the generation of thermals over hot surfaces, capable of lifting pollen grains. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, this taxon has suffered severe declines as a result of agricultural intensification. Conservation efforts largely focus on providing forage resources for bumblebees through the summer, but providing suitable habitat during the period of nest foundation in early spring could be a more effective method of boosting local bumblebee populations. This study assesses the attractiveness of three different farmland habitat types (hedgerow, field margin and grassland), and the relative merits of respective land management prescriptions under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme to nest site searching and foraging bumblebee queens during the period of queen emergence and colony foundation. Hedgerows were the least attractive habitat type to spring queens. Rural Stewardship species-rich grassland comprised a complex vegetation structure attracting nest site searching queens, whilst grassland that had been abandoned allowing natural regeneration contained more flowers, attracting foraging queens. Field margin habitats were the most attractive habitat type, and Rural Stewardship field margins attracted both nest site searching and foraging queens at relatively high densities. This management option consisted of a sown grass mix, giving rise to the complex vegetation structure preferred by nest site searching queens, but regular disturbance allowed invasion by early flowering bumblebee forage plants. These findings suggest that it should be possible to develop simple combined management strategies to provide both suitable nesting sites and spring forage resources on farmland, promoting bumblebee colony foundation and therefore abundance in the agricultural environment. © 2009.",Agri-environment; Agriculture; Bombus; Farm; Land management; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349152831

Even if the appeal of visual appearance is based on consumer perception rather than on established quality factors, breeders must usually select within the range of acceptance, at least in some countries. Mango selection using multiyear breeding programs is slowly replacing the former method by which most earlier cultivars were selected, namely from chance seedlings either from planned or unplanned crosses. The knowledge of heritability of traits as they are controlled by genetics and experimental design and the effects and interaction of these two sets of factors on achieved gain have become more critical. The use of portable colorimeters has been shown to give repeatable scores in a quantitative, three-dimensional space for fruits and vegetables. In this experiment, we calculated broad-sense heritability estimates for five color traits, three morphological fruit traits, and one disease resistance trait (anthracnose expressed on the fruit). Estimates were found to be relatively high, indicating good potential for improvement through breeding. For nearly all traits measured, variance within families was greater than that among families, illustrating the likely importance of heterozygosity, dominance, and epistasis in these crosses. The careful estimation of heritability and repeatability will help prioritize and increase the efficiency of trait improvement as breeding methods become more sophisticated and competition for funding increases.",Colorimetric measurments; Mangifera indica; Mango breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350173305

The extent to which frost susceptibility was related to phenology and the relationship between population differentiation and climatic conditions was studied.  Twigs were collected in March and November from saplings (5-year-old trees) of 41 open-pollinated families from the six populations in a provenance-progeny test, and were subjected to artificial freezing. Damage to each twig was assessed as visible browning of bud and of stem tissues.  Population differences as regards frost damage traits were highly significant (p < 0.01)) in both spring and autumn. Family differences within populations were low, often non-significant, and in all cases smaller than differences among populations. Population means were closely correlated with the parental drought and frost conditions. Populations originating from dry areas or from regions where frost seldom occurs were the least resistant.  Drought is suggested to be the one of the most important selective agents that shapes population differentiation in Spanish wild chestnut, while frost may be more important in northern Spain. Phenological differences are not always good predictors of the degree of frost damage. Thus, freezing tests should be used to detect frost susceptibility in chestnuts. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.",Freeze testing; Frost resistance; Genetic variation; Phenological traits; Wild chestnut,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449597689

The first programme produced cultivar Virtue and was done as part of a research programme on heterosis. It involved the production and trialling in 1991 of 95 F6 families from a single cross made in 1985 between lines derived from cultivars Criffel and Marian. Six F6 families were mass multiplied in polythene tunnels in 1992, using blowflies as pollinators, and trialled in 1993 and 1994 before Virtue was entered into National List (NL) trials in 1995. The second programme was done as a commercially funded breeding programme and involved the production and trialling in 1999 of 1,037 F6 families from 15 crosses made in 1993. Fifty F6 families were advanced to F7 in a glasshouse in 2000 and assessed in 2001. Six F7 families were mass multiplied in polythene tunnels in 2002 and trialled in 2003. Two cultivars, Gowrie and Lomond, from the cross between Airlie and Invitation, were produced from the programme and entered NL trials in 2004. The SSD was traditional in the sense that each advanced family was descended from a different F2 plant without selection and a glasshouse was used for the selfing generations. However, it differed from the schemes that have been operated for soybean and spring cereals in that it was not possible to grow two or three generations a year because of the vernalization requirements of swedes, and it was not possible to grow a large number of plants at really high density because the inflorescences needed to be covered with Glassine bags to prevent cross pollination. In yield trials over 4 years, Gowrie had the highest dry-matter yield (12.59 t/ha) of the three new cultivars, out yielded Magres (11.28 t/ha) and other shopping swedes, but was not as high yielding as cultivar Kenmore (13.44 t/ha) which had been produced by pedigree inbreeding with selection.

Tillage levels (zero and conventional) were assigned to the main plots, populations (90000, 60000 and 30000 plants ha-1) to the sub-plots and four types of mulches (weeds mulch, black plastic mulch, white plastic mulch and mungbean as living mulch), a hand weeding and a weedy check were allotted to sub-sub plots, respectively. Data were recorded on fresh weed biomass (kg ha-1), leaf area of maize plant-1 (cm2), leaf area index and biological yield (kg ha-1). Fresh weed biomass was not affected significantly by the years, whereas all other factors affected the fresh weed biomass. Zero tillage resulted in maximum fresh weed biomass of 183 kg ha-1 as compared to 165 kg ha-1 in the conventional tillage. While lesser weed biomass (151 kg ha-1) was recorded in the highest population of 90000 plants ha-1 as compared to 60000 plants ha-1 (168 kg ha-1) and 30000 plants ha-1 (183 kg ha-1), respectively. Minimum fresh weed biomass was recorded in hand weeding (112 kg ha-1) and statistically at par with black plastic mulch (120 kg ha-1), followed by weeds mulch (164 kg ha-1), white plastic mulch (191 kg ha-1) and living mulch (195 kg ha-1) as compared to weedy check (260 kg ha-1). With zero-tillage biological yield was 7708 kg ha-1 as compared to 7980 kg ha-1 in conventional tillage. Similarly, increasing crop density increased biological yield, having 7000, 7992 and 8541 kg ha-1 in 30000, 60000 and 90000 plants ha-1, respectively. However, biological yield of individual plants was decreased with increasing plant population. Similarly, mulches, hand weeding and weedy check also affected the biological yield of maize. Significantly higher biological yield of 9118 kg ha-1 was recorded in the hand weeding as compared to weedy check (5537 kg ha-1) and black plastic mulch (8982 kg ha-1). However, based on high cost of plastic, its use is not economical. With weeds mulch (7956 kg ha-1), white plastic (7934 kg ha-1) and living mulch (7540 kg ha-1) yield was not enhanced, as otherwise expected. Based on two years study it is suggested that even if tillage options and plant populations are a part of the weed management program, it should not be used as a sole management tool, instead it must be integrated and supplemented with other control methods, like mulches, hand weeding and/or herbicides.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70849115643

However, studies comparing the toxicity of pesticides to different individuals and species are lacking, making it difficult to evaluate their short- and long-term effects on colonies and populations of these insects. In this work, we tested the lethality of compounds from the main pesticide groups on stingless bees of the species Melipona beecheii Bennett, Trigona nigra Provancher, and Nannotrigona perilampoides Cresson. The LD50 (in micrograms per bee) for each pesticide was calculated for callow workers and foragers of the three species as well as for gynes and drones of M. beecheii. The results showed that all species were highly susceptible to the evaluated compounds. Nicotinoid pesticides were the most toxic, followed in descending order by permethrin, diazinon, and methomyl. We found evidence of a relationship between the body weight of the species and their LD50 for permethrin and methomyl (r = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively) but not for diazinon (r = -0.089). An analysis of contingency tables showed that within each species, callow workers had higher mortalities than foragers (P &lt; 0.01). In M. beecheii at similar pesticide dose more males died compared with females [?(0.01),1 = 10.16]. However, gynes were less resistant than workers [?(0.01),1 = 8.11]. The potential negative consequences of pesticides to native stingless bees are discussed considering the reproductive biology of these insects.

However, the study of the effect of multiple pests on agricultural productivity has remained largely disconnected from the ongoing debate on how species diversity affects the productivity of ecosystems. The aim of our study is to use information from crop studies to inform the debate on species diversity and ecosystem productivity. We present the results of an experimental study that manipulated the species richness of three tuber feeding moth species (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) at constant larval density. We measured the influence of this manipulation on (1) damage to the economically most important crop in the Andean region, the potato Solanum tuberosum and (2) the performance of the moths as a consequence of feeding rates. Our results showed that the three pest species together cause more damage to the crop than is predicted from the effects of each pest alone. This resulted in significant increases in pupal biomass and fecundity. Potential mechanisms to explain our results are (1) more complete resource utilization and thus greater crop damage (feeding complementarity) and (2) negative interactions, where intra-specific interactions are greater than inter-specific interactions. Synthesis and applications. Our findings may have important consequences for integrated pest management in poor tropical countries. Biodiversity in many tropical countries is decreasing rapidly, leading to reductions in ecosystem services such as biocontrol and pollination. At the same time an increasing number of species, many of them agricultural pests, are being introduced by humans. Our results show that the potential complementarity effects among pest species may increase damage to field crops to a larger extent than previously expected. Control strategies to limit the introduction of new pest species are therefore urgently needed in these countries where the daily management of biological resources is largely in the hands of poor rural people and local government staff with limited funding. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Additive effects; Biocontrol; Biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship; Complementarity; Crop damage; Fitness; Potato moths,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349671171

To produce immature embryos routinely and continuously requires a well-equipped greenhouse and laborious artificial pollination. To overcome this limitation, an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system using explants of type II embryogenic calli was developed. Once the type II embryogenic calli are produced, they can be subcultured and/or proliferated conveniently. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate a stable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize using explants of type II embryonic calli and to evaluate the efficiency of the protocol in order to develop herbicide-resistant maize. The type II embryogenic calli were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying binary vector pTF102, and then were subsequently cultured on the following media: co-cultivation medium for 1 day, delay medium for 7 days, selection medium for 4 × 14 days, regeneration medium, and finally on germination medium. The T-DNA of the vector carried two cassettes (Ubi promoter-EPSPs ORF-nos and 35S promoter-bar ORF-nos). The EPSPs conferred resistance to glyphosate and bar conferred resistance to phosphinothricin. The confirmation of stable transformation and the efficiency of transformation was based on the resistance to phosphinothricin indicated by the growth of putative transgenic calli on selection medium amended with 4 mg l-1 phosphinothricin, northern blot analysis of bar gene, and leaf painting assay for detection of bar gene-based herbicide resistance. Northern blot analysis and leaf painting assay confirmed the expression of bar transgenes in the R1 generation. The average transformation efficiency was 0.60%. Based on northern blot analysis and leaf painting assay, line 31 was selected as an elite line of maize resistant to herbicide. © Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer 2009.",Agrobacterium; Genetic transformation; Type II embryogenic calli; Zea mays L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350448623

This study examines whether ecological isolation can explain the continuing integrity of Silene dioica and S. latifolia where floral isolation is weak and hybrids are fully viable. Eighteen small replicate founder populations of 6 individuals (3 males and 3 females) of either S. latifolia, S. dioica or hybrids were created in woodland and in open sites in southern UK. Survival, reproduction and introgression of these populations were examined over 9 years. S. latifolia and hybrid plants suffered higher mortality than S. dioica in woodland. In open sites, there was extensive introgression, with few or no pure S. latifolia or S. dioica surviving by the end of the experiment. The experiment suggests that the integrity of S. dioica is maintained by its ability to survive in shaded habitats where S. latifolia and hybrids cannot persist. However, how S. latifolia survives as a distinct species in the study area remains a puzzle. Immigration from regions where S. latifolia occurs in isolation (i.e. large-scale ecological isolation) may balance introgression in the study area. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Hybrids; Introgression; Pollination; Seed predation; Survival,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350605532

Though morphological modification of carnation is very important to its commercial value, there have been no relevant reports until now. PttKN1 (Populus tremula × Tremuoides knotted1), isolated from the vascular cambial region of hybrid aspen, is a novel member of KNOX gene family. In this paper, we transformed 35S:PttKN1 to carnation via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. All primary transformants subsequently obtained were placed into phenotypic categories and self-pollinated. A total of 32 T0 progeny with aberrant phenotypes were obtained. PCR assay proved the validity of these transgenic plants. Phenotypes of 32 35S:PttKN1 plants were distinct from those of wild-type plants, including: (1) modification of phyllotaxis (15/32): wild-type carnation was with typical opposite phyllotaxis, while transgenic plants displayed tricussate whorled and multiple-cussate whorled phyllotaxis. Irregular modification of phyllotaxis was also observed; (2) modification of stem (9/32): wild-type stems were round; however, some transgenic plants exhibited much thicker and flatter stem; (3) the whole transgenic plants of carnation (8/32) became dwarf. These morphological modifications of carnation indicate that we have successfully attained some novel lines of carnation. These lines can have potential practical applications. In conclusion, the selection of stably genetic lines is discussed. © Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków 2009.",Dianthus caryophyllus L.

Seed addition increased internal invader seedling densities and the probability of successful colonization per species. Legumes, tall herbs and species with large and long-lived seeds or a requirement for specific vectors for pollination and dispersal benefited from seed addition most. The number of successfully established internal invader species was highest in plots with low initial species richness and in the regularly weeded treatments and lowest in plots with high initial species richness and in the never weeded treatments, indicating decreased recruitment with increased successional age. Resident plant communities with legumes had mostly negative (legume and small- and tall-herb internal invaders, external invaders) or neutral (grass invaders) effects on seedling density and colonization probability of invader species whereas resident communities with grasses had positive effects on the colonization probability of invader species except grasses themselves. These results show that seed limitation, invader characteristics, and community characteristics all can affect recruitment success in predictable ways, suggesting non-random community assembly during succession starting from different initial species pools. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349694044

Hybridization between the parental species is rare under natural conditions and difficult using controlled pollination because of phenological and genetic incompatibilities. The identification of hybridogenic parents is the first step toward obtaining hybrid progeny. We report the application of microsatellite markers for DNA fingerprinting and parentage analysis of half-sib families collected in a natural mixed population for which no phenological and morphological data were available. Ten nuclear, neutral, simple sequence repeat markers were used to analyse 600 samples. The high levels of polymorphism detected positively influenced the exclusion and identity probabilities. The assignment analysis revealed the presence of 198 diploid J. × intermedia hybrids among the seedling progeny. Maternity checks were performed on all individuals and few errors of sampling were found. Four distinct hybridogenic mother trees were identified, each showing different reproductive success rates. The 198 diploid hybrids belonged to four open-pollinated families based on an analysis of paternity using a likelihood approach. Differential male reproductive success was observed among pollen donors within the research site. Forty-nine of the 198 diploid hybrids detected in four progenies were sired by only three J. regia genotypes.

Genetic structure was quantified at three spatial scales: (1) within apparent clones (intrapatch), (2) among clones within a field, and (3) among fields separated by as much as 65 km. Of five ""clones"" or putative individuals examined in the intrapatch study, two showed complete genetic homogeneity within the patch, while three showed some band differences at their edges compared with their interiors. These differences at the edges, however, matched adjacent clones (so-called ""intruders""), from which it was concluded that lowbush blueberry exhibits a fairly tight, phalanx clonal architecture with no evidence of invasive seedling establishment within clones. No significant correlation between genetic and physical distance was found among clones within fields via several statistical approaches. Significant among-field genetic differentiation was found via AMOVA (øPT = 8.4%; p ? 0.01) based upon transect samples across four fields ranging from 12.5 to 65 km apart. Principal component analysis and spatial autocorrelation (SA) corroborated these findings. Significant positive SA was found at the within-field distance class of &lt;350 m, but SA decreased to an insignificant value by the first interfield distance of 12.5 km. A special form of SA analysis was employed to detect ""hotspots"" of genetic similarity between pairs of adjacent clones in two fields. Results indicated that 5 of 23 pairs of clones (21.7%) were genetically similar to each other, while the majority of pairs (18 of 23; 78.3%) showed random, decreasing patterns of genetic similarity.

Based on distribution records of 645 species incorporated in the ""Southern African Bee Database"" (SouthABees), the pattern of bee diversity was analysed on a 2° × 2° grid. The resulting map shows a bicentric pattern, with highest species diversity located in the arid west and in the relatively moist east. The investigation of distribution patterns of 516 South African species identified twelve distribution types that largely coincide with patterns in the seasonality of precipitation: winter rainfall, early to mid summer rainfall, late to very late summer rainfall and rain all year. The largest number of bee species is associated with the winter rainfall area (46.3% of the fauna) and with the early to mid summer rainfall area (36.5% of the fauna). Consequently South Africa is a centre of bee diversity of global significance. The most important centres of endemism are the winter rainfall area in the west (27.3% of total fauna endemic) and the early to mid summer rainfall area (29.1% of total fauna endemic) in the east.

Maximum fresh-mass-specific CO2 production rate was 0.17 ?mol s-1 g-1 to achieve a 10.9 °C temperature elevation by the appendix, and 0.92 ?mol s-1 g-1 to achieve a 4.8 °C elevation by male florets.

It began in 1991 and has involved cycles of crossing, selection between from 120 to 145 progenies (full-sib families), and clonal selection within the selected progenies. We have shown that the breeding scheme can operate on a 3-year cycle with limited within progeny selection, and on a 5- or 6-year cycle with more extensive within progeny selection. Six years are required when resistance to late blight is assessed in the tubers as well as the foliage. The more extensive within progeny selection is recommended once genes have been combined from sufficient parents to achieve one's objectives. The yield increase after three cycles of indirect selection through breeders' visual preference was only modest because it was operating against a decrease which would occur in the absence of selection. A practical improvement in the scheme would be to increase the number of progenies assessed to over 200, given the moderate to high heritabilities of the progeny and clonal tests. But this would require a considerable effort because the success rate achieved with the potato pollinations was typical at just over 30%.

Using microsatellite markers, we estimated outcrossing in a commercial California 'Hass' avocado orchard with adjacent 'Bacon' pollinizers. Seedlings grown from mature harvested fruit of both cultivars were genotyped with five fully informative microsatellite markers and their parentage determined.

Among the 850 seedlings of 'Bacon', 382 (45%) were hybrids with 'Hass' and the remaining 468 (55%) seedlings were selfs of 'Bacon'. The high outcrossing rate observed in the 'Hass' seedlings was expected, because adjacent rows of opposite flowering types (A versus B) are expected to outcross. However, the high selfing rate in 'Bacon' was unexpected. A previous study in Florida using the cultivars 'Simmonds' and 'Tonnage' demonstrated differences in outcrossing rates between complementary flowering type cultivars. In both Florida and California, the A type parents ('Hass' and 'Simmonds') had similar outcrossing rates ('75%); however, the B type parents ('Bacon' and 'Tonnage') had highly skewed outcrossing rates of 45% and 96%, respectively.

In angiosperms, molecular mechanisms have recently been revealed that are crucial for the dialog between male (pollen tube) and female gametophytes required for successful sperm delivery. When pollen tubes reach the female gametophyte, they arrest growth, burst and discharge their sperm cells. These processes are under the control of the female gametophyte via the receptor-like serine-threonine kinase (RLK) FERONIA (FER). However, the male signaling components that control the sperm delivery remain elusive. Here, we show that ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 (ANX1, ANX2), which encode the closest homologs of the FER-RLK in Arabidopsis, are preferentially expressed in pollen. Moreover, ANX1-YFP and ANX2-YFP fusion proteins display polar localization to the plasma membrane at the tip of the pollen tube. Finally, genetic analyses demonstrate that ANX1 and ANX2 function redundantly to control the timing of pollen tube discharge as anx1 anx2 double-mutant pollen tubes cease their growth and burst in vitro and fail to reach the female gametophytes in vivo. We propose that ANXRLKs constitutively inhibit pollen tube rupture and sperm discharge at the tip of growing pollen tubes to sustain their growth within maternal tissues until they reach the female gametophytes. Upon arrival, the female FER-dependent signaling cascade is activated to mediate pollen tube reception and fertilization, while male ANX-dependent signaling is deactivated, enabling the pollen tube to rupture and deliver its sperm cells to effect fertilization.",ANXUR; Arabidopsis; CrRLK1L; Discharge; FERONIA; Fertilization; Gametophyte; Pollen tube; Pollination; Receptor-like kinase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349931758

When fruit set consistently falls below acceptable levels, growers may attempt to increase fruit set by increasing the availability of compatible pollen. We describe the use of the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) as a genetic marker to quantify the relative contributions of competing pollen sources in achieving fruit set in 'BalatonTM' sour cherry. Pollen race experiments were conducted to determine if nonself-pollen provided in a pollen mixture was more competitive than self-pollen in achieving fruit set in 'Balaton'. We further investigated what pollen set the 'Balaton' crop in two commercial 'Balaton' orchards where multiple potential pollinators were planted in adjacent orchards. S-allele genotyping using DNA extracted from the seed was done to discriminate among the competing pollen sources. The results suggest that in certain environmental conditions, nonself-pollen may be more competitive in achieving fruit set in 'Balaton' than self-pollen.

Although many members of this family have been implicated in plant growth, development and signal transduction, only a few ANK genes have been reported in rice. In this study, we analyzed the structures, phylogenetic relationship, genome localizations and expression profiles of 175 ankyrin repeat genes identified in rice (OsANK). Domain composition analysis suggested OsANK proteins can be classified into ten subfamilies. Chromosomal localizations of OsANK genes indicated nine segmental duplication events involving 17 genes and 65 OsANK genes were involved in tandem duplications. The expression profiles of 158 OsANK genes were analyzed in 24 tissues covering the whole life cycle of two rice genotypes, Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Sixteen genes showed preferential expression in given tissues compared to all the other tissues in Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Nine genes were preferentially expressed in stamen of 1 day before flowering, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in pollination and fertilization. Expression data of OsANK genes were also obtained with tissues of seedlings subjected to three phytohormone (NAA, GA3 and KT) and light/dark treatments. Eighteen genes showed differential expression with at least one phytohormone treatment while under light/dark treatments, 13 OsANK genes showed differential expression.

This is partly because of the inherent variation in mating patterns which may exist within species and the fact that few studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of forest fragmentation on contemporary mating patterns, including effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired fragmented and continuous populations on the island of Tasmania and in Victoria on mainland Australia. The mating patterns in the two continuous populations were similar, despite large differences in population density. In contrast, the two fragmented populations were variable and idiosyncratic in their mating patterns, particularly in their pollen dispersal kernels. The continuous populations showed relatively high outcrossing rates (86-89%) and low correlated paternity (0.03-0.06) compared with the fragmented populations (65-79% and 0.12-0.20 respectively). A greater proportion of trees contributed to reproduction in the fragmented (de/d? 0.5) compared with the continuous populations (de/d = 0.03-0.04). Despite significant inbreeding in the offspring of the fragmented populations, there was little evidence of loss of genetic diversity. It is argued that enhanced medium- and long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes may act to partly buffer the remnant populations from the negative effects of inbreeding and drift. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Effective density; Eucalypt; Forest remnants; KINDIST; Mating patterns; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349876453

How prey is actually lured into the traps, however, is less well understood. Trapping prey may be achieved in a random way, for example by camouflaging the traps (hiding them in the surrounding vegetation), so that prey is trapped by accidental landing on the trap leaves or wind drift, or in the other extreme, trapping may involve mimicry of other attractive resources such as fruits or flowers by using specific visual or olfactory signals to attract a specific prey assemblage. 2. We investigated for the first time volatiles of the trapping leaves of carnivorous plant species by dynamic headspace methods. We present data on the venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula, the sundew Drosera binata, and the North American pitcher plants Sarracenia flava, Sarracenia leucophylla, Sarracenia minor, and Sarracenia purpurea. A large number of compounds and relatively high emission rates were found in three of the North American pitcher plants (S. flava, S. leucophylla, and S. minor) with compounds typically found in flowers or fruits. This suggests together with other features (e.g. colour, nectar production) that these traps are possibly flower or fruit mimics. The leaves of S. purpurea, Dionaea muscipula, and Drosera binata emitted much weaker scents with lower numbers of components, consisting mainly of volatiles typically emitted from green leaves. 3. We discuss whether or not the use of volatiles for attracting prey animals is linked with specific trapping mechanisms and whether carnivorous plants can be grouped into specialized 'olfactory syndromes'. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Insectivorous plants; Pollinator-prey conflict; Trap volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349321502

Relict trees serve as ""regeneration foci"" because they ameliorate the soil microclimate and serve as safe spots for dispersers. Here, we describe another mechanism by which remnant trees may facilitate pasture regeneration: the presence of seed banks in the canopy soil that accumulates from decomposing epiphytes within the crowns of mature remnant trees in tropical cloud forest pastures. We compared seed banks of canopy soils (histosols derived from fallen leaves, fruits, flower, and twigs of host trees and epiphytes, dead bryophytes, bark, detritus, dead animals, and microorganisms, and dust that accumulate on trunks and the upper surfaces of large branches) in pastures, canopy soils in primary forest trees, and soil on the forest floor in Monteverde, Costa Rica. There were 5211 epiphytic and terrestrial plant seeds in the three habitats. All habitats were dominated by seeds in a relatively small number of plant families, most of which were primarily woody, animal pollinated, and animal dispersed. The density of seeds on the forest floor was greater than seed density in either pasture-canopy or forest-canopy soils; the latter two did not differ. Eight species in 44 families and 61 genera from all of the habitats were tallied. There were 37 species in the pasture-canopy soil, 33 in the forest-canopy soil, and 57 on the forest floor. Eleven species were common to all habitats. The mean species richness in the pasture canopy was significantly higher than the forest canopy (F = 83.38; p < 0.02). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that the communities were distinct. Greenhouse experiments verified that many of these seeds were viable, with 29 taxa germinating (23 taxa in pruned mats [mimic of exposed conditions] and 16 taxa in control mats [intact conditions]) within 2 months of observation. Nearly half the species that germinated were characteristic of primary forests (primary forest samples, 19%; pasture samples, 29%). This supports the idea that canopy seed banks of pasture trees can function as time capsules by providing propagules that are removed in both space and time from the primary forest. Their presence may enhance the ability of pastures to regenerate more quickly, reinforcing the importance of trees in agricultural settings. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.",Biodiversity conservation; Monteverde; Pasture tree; Regeneration foci; Relict tree; Remnant tree; Seed bank; Tropical cloud forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349208655

San Martín 4453, C1417DSE Buenos Aires, Argentina","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is common in cereals that lack grain dormancy if maturing grain is exposed to rain. This phenomenon leads to immediate loss of seed viability, and since the malting process requires germination, its occurrence is highly undesirable in malting barley crops. Dormancy release rate is genetically and environmentally controlled. We evaluated the effect of temperature during grain filling on the dormancy release pattern (and then on the PHS susceptibility) of grains from five malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars widely sown in Argentina, with the aim of predicting PHS susceptibility of a barley crop from easy-to-gather data. Barley cultivars (Quilmes Ayelén, Q. Palomar, Q. Painé, B1215 and Scarlett) were sown on different dates over a 3-year period for generating variability in the thermal environment during grain filling. The period from pollination to physiological maturity (PM) was adjusted to a thermal time (TT) scale, which was then arbitrarily divided into 50 °C d intervals. Mean air temperature within each interval and for the whole filling period was calculated for the different sowing dates. Dormancy release pattern was followed by determining a weighed germination index (GI) throughout grain filling and maturation. We sought a linear relationship between temperature during grain filling and GI at some moment after PM. For all barley cultivars, except B1215, a significant (p < 0.001) and positive correlation was found between the GI of grains with 10-20% moisture content (fresh basis) and mean temperature within TT intervals located at the last stages of seed development. Then, simply temperature-based models for predicting crop PHS susceptibility were generated for each barley cultivar. Moreover, we intended a single, universal prediction model constructed with data from all cultivars. Two general forms were proposed, but the relationships were slightly less tight when each barley cultivar model was used. A preliminary validation for each cultivar model was done for three genotypes with independent data from four sites of the major barley production area in Argentina. When comparing experimental and field data regressions we did not find significant differences in slope for any cultivar (p > 0.25). However, most of the observed GIs were higher than predicted. This upwards displacement of GI-temperature relationship suggests the role of other environmental factors (i.e. water and soil N availability, day length), differing among tested locations. We are currently evaluating and quantifying the effect of these factors with the aim of improving PHS susceptibility prediction in malting barley crops. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Disturbance to habitat structure can have a major impact on insect diversity and composition, potentially reducing fruit yields. We investigated the impact of habitat disturbance on the fig wasp community associated with male figs of Ficus tinctoria in Xishuangbanna, China. The community comprised one pollinator species Liporrhopalum gibbosae and six non-pollinating wasp species: Sycoscapter sp.1, Philotrypesis ravii, Philotrypesis sp.1, Neosycophila omeomorpha, Sycophila sp.1, and Walkerella sp.1. More disturbed areas were characterized by higher temperatures, less shade, and more vehicle noise. The response of the fig wasp community was complex, with no simple relationship between intensity of disturbance and pollinator abundance. However, the sex ratios (proportion of male progeny) of pollinators increased significantly in more disturbed areas. We conclude that potential changes in fig wasp community composition brought about by disturbance, are unpredictable, with unclear consequences for tropical rainforest biodiversity. © Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Disturbance; Ficus tinctoria; Fig/fig wasp mutualism; Wasp community,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349438913

But ants are rarely pollinators, and their visits to flowers may be detrimental to plant fitness. 2. Plants therefore have various strategies to control ant distributions, and restrict them to foliage rather than flowers. These 'filters' may involve physical barriers on or around flowers, or 'decoys and bribes' sited on the foliage (usually extrafloral nectaries - EFNs). Alternatively, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used as signals to control ant behaviour, attracting ants to leaves and/or deterring them from functional flowers. Some of the past evidence that flowers repel ants by VOCs has been equivocal and we describe the shortcomings of some experimental approaches, which involve behavioural tests in artificial conditions. 3. We review our previous study of myrmecophytic acacias, which used in situ experiments to show that volatiles derived from pollen can specifically and transiently deter ants during dehiscence, the effects being stronger in ant-guarded species and more effective on resident ants, both in African and Neotropical species. In these plants, repellence involves at least some volatiles that are known components of ant alarm pheromones, but are not repellent to beneficial bee visitors. 4.

'La France' and 'Ballade' with the Citrus FLOWERING LOCUS T (CiFT) gene, which induces early flowering. Subsequent DNA blot analysis of the transformed and wild-type plants indicated that the transformed plants carried 1-4 copies of CiFT. Of the 8 transformed 'La France' and 7 transgenic 'Ballade' plant lines obtained, 7 and 5 lines respectively, flowered early when cultivated in vitro in a micropropagation medium. No correlation was found between the CiFT copy number and early flowering in vitro, however, the results of RNA gel blot analysis indicated a strong correlation between the expression of the CiFT gene and floral bud differentiation in vitro. Flowers that developed in vitro differed from wild-type flowers in terms of phenotypic traits, such as the number of pistils, petals, sepals, and stamens. To investigate the inheritance pattern of the CiFT gene, we obtained 15 seeds from the fruits of P. communis L.

Of 7 seedlings that expressed the CiFT gene, 5 flowered within 10 months after they were transferred to a greenhouse.

Here, we used plant species richness and morphometric traits data across steep elevational gradients in the Helan Range of Northwestern China in an attempt to separate general trends (temperature related) from regional peculiarity (moisture related). Based on the floristic data of the Helan Range as well as plot-based data, both drought (at low elevation) and low temperature (high elevation) are associated with low species richness presumably also explaining the peak in diversity at mid-elevation, where climatic conditions are moderate. However, this mid-elevation peak in diversity is not mirrored in trends of plant traits such as leaf size and inflorescence size, which show either unidirectional trends or no change with elevation (with impacts of drought and low temperature perhaps gradually replacing each other). Our analysis illustrated the taxonomic and plant functional type (PFT)-related biases in functional trait studies and showed that consistent patterns only emerge after careful data stratification, with taxonomy (family level) holding more promises than PFTs. Inflorescence size increased with elevation in major insect-pollinated families, a trend not seen in wind-pollinated (graminoid) families. However, the reproductive effort expressed as inflorescence/leaf length ratio increases with elevation in the majority of plant families, irrespective of their pollination system. The fact that these biometric responses to elevation do not correlate with responses in species richness (which peaks at mid-elevation) may reflect contrasting drivers of trait selection and biodiversity. Based on our plot-based data, this analysis also confirmed the usefulness of floristic archive data for testing ecological theory related to elevational gradients. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Elevational gradient; Flowering; Mountain climate; Plant functional types; Reproduction; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350613230

GMS and CMS are two types of male sterility system that currently employed in pepper breeding. Conversion from GMS to CMS will increase the male sterility proportion of female parent from 50 to 100%. In this study, segregation analysis of four male sterile mutants consisting of one CMS mutant (CA1) and three GMS mutants (GA1, GA3 and GA4) showed that each had single recessive gene inheritance. A modified complementation test was performed by replacing male sterile mutants with their maintainer line as male parent. The nuclear restorer gene for CMS was independent of all nuclear restorer genes for GMS and all nuclear restorer genes for GMS were independent each other. Further observation on CMS and GMS male sterility loci revealed that GA1 and GA3 had mutated in both nuclear restorer genes for CMS and GMS, while CA1 and GA4 each carried mutation in single male sterility system of nuclear restorer gene for CMS and GMS, respectively. Conversion from GMS to CMS in the case of lines carried mutations in both sterility systems required only S-type cytoplasm donor, while lines carried mutation in single nuclear restorer gene for GMS required not only S-type cytoplasm but also rf allele donors. The important finding is the broader function of maintainer line in certain male sterility system that can be used as a maintainer or restorer line for other male sterility systems.

A Bayesian approach, implemented using Gibbs sampling algorithm, was used in data analyses. Precocity was assessed as a binary response at age three and was found to be highly heritable. The estimates of posterior mean and of the 95% posterior interval of the heritability were 0.51 and [0.46-0.56], respectively. Estimated genetic gain ranged from 36.15 to 41.22% (selection intensities of 14.29 and 7.48%, respectively). Total height, basal diameter and survival (measured at age 5) had a positive and relatively moderate genetic correlation with early flowering (r = 0.23, 0.29 and 0.11, respectively) indicating that selection for early flowering alone would have a moderate impact on growth and survival.

Embryogenic cell lines of P. pinaster were established from immature zygotic embryos excised from seeds obtained from open-pollinated trees. During the maturation stage, phenotype of somatic embryos was characterized as being either normal or abnormal. Based upon the prevalent morphological traits, different types of abnormal embryos underwent further classification and quantification. Nuclear DNA content of maritime pine using the zygotic embryos was estimated to be 57.04 pg/2C, using propidium iodide flow cytometry. According to the same methodology, no significant differences (P ? 0.01) in DNA ploidy were detected among the most frequently observed abnormal phenotypes, embryogenic cell lines, zygotic and normal somatic embryos, and somatic embryogenesis-derived plantlets. Although the differences in DNA ploidy level do not exclude the occurrence of a low level of aneuploidy, the results obtained point to the absence of major changes in ploidy level during the somatic embryogenesis process of this economically important species.

Additionally, phenotypic observations are highly influenced by genotype-by-environment interaction effects. Usually, Bayesian approaches to predict breeding values (in self-pollinating crops) omit genotype-by-environment interactions in the statistical model, which may result in biased estimates. In our study, a Bayesian Gibbs sampling algorithm was developed that is adapted to the high degree of inbreeding in self-pollinated crops and accounts for interaction effects between genotype and environment. As related lines are supposed to show similar genotype-by-environment interaction effects, an extended genetic relationship matrix is included in the Bayesian model. Additionally, since the coefficient matrix C in the mixed model equations can be characterized by rank deficiencies, the pseudoinverse of C was calculated by using the nullspace, which resulted in a faster computation time. In this study, field data of spring barley lines and data of a 'virtual' parental population of self-pollinating crops, generated by computer simulation, were used. For comparison, additional breeding values were predicted by a frequentist approach. In general, standard Bayesian Gibbs sampling and a frequentist approach resulted in similar estimates if heritability of the regarded trait was high. For low heritable traits, the modified Bayesian model, accounting for relatedness between lines in genotype-by-environment interaction, was superior to the standard model. © 2009 Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349236008

Larval feeding provides most of the nutrients for development of these insects but is not thought to influence the de novo production of the fatty-acid derived compounds used as pheromones by most species. Feeding on plant nectar (sugar) by adult moths is important for increasing female fitness and also for the pollination of many plant species. In this paper, I show that feeding on sucrose solution, as opposed to water, increases sex pheromone titre in mated, but not virgin, female Heliothis virescens. Mating caused a rapid decrease in haemolymph trehalose concentration, which was restored to near-virgin levels by sugar ingestion. When isolated mated female abdomens were cultured with different concentrations of trehalose, pheromone titre increased with increasing trehalose concentration. This effect was not observed when abdomens were cultured on saline containing the sugar rhamnose, which insects cannot metabolise to glucose. Virgins injected with the juvenile hormone (JH) analogue, methoprene, showed the same effects as mated females with respect to pheromone titre and haemolymph trehalose concentration. Thus, following mating increases in JH titre increase demand for, and lowering of, blood sugar to develop oocytes, which can be compensated for by sugar ingestion. Haemolymph trehalose concentration probably influences glycolysis in gland cells and, consequently, levels of cytosolic citrate and acetyl-CoA for pheromone biosynthesis. This increase in pheromone titre in sugar-fed, mated females may facilitate further mating and increased fecundity. Thus, exogenous sugar feeding is behaviourally and physiologically integrated with endogenous JH titre to maximise female fitness.",Juvenile hormone; Methoprene; Nectar feeding; Pheromone biosynthesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349230928

The method, as applied on the material in hand, allows the capture of 75-85% of the genetic response to selection attained through conventional programmes without the need to do any controlled pollination and simplified or possibly no experimental field testing: both considered to be the most resource-demanding activities in breeding programmes. BWB combines the use of genotypic or phenotypic pre-selection of superior individuals, informative DNA markers for fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction of offspring to assemble naturally created full- and half-sib families resulting from mating among selected parents, and quantitative genetics analyses to identify elite genotypes for further genetic improvement or the establishment of production populations. BWB utility is demonstrated using a retrospective study of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) progeny tests consisting of offspring produced from 150 controlled crosses among 60 parents and established over three sites. The empirical results are supported by theoretical expectations demonstrating anticipated minimum genetic response compared with conventional approaches. The method's simplicity offers an exceptional opportunity for the development of comparable breeding efforts in developing countries, advanced and new breeding programmes, and economically important and 'minor' species. © 2009 Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349243804

The present study applies the conceptual model of a hierarchy of causes to Lasiopetalum pterocarpum E.M.Benn. K.Shep. (a critically endangered species) to understand better its reproductive and ecological attributes, possible reasons for its rarity and to determine whether this model assists in developing management strategies. L. pterocarpum subpopulations from Serpentine National Park were censused to record abundance, plant health, phenology, flower and fruit production and the presence of any seed bank. These characteristics were matched to criteria in the hierarchies of cause model. There was no evidence of recent seedling recruitment at any subpopulation. Hand-pollination produced a flower-to-fruit conversion proportion similar to that found in the field and self- and cross-pollinations produced virtually the same fruit set. Seed store in soil from beneath the native subpopulations and at a translocation site showed seed was patchily distributed and infrequent. L. pterocarpum is an obligate seeder, killed by fire and dependent on disturbance to break seed dormancy. However, smoke has no effect on germination. Seed production does not constrain population growth, because seedling regeneration after fire in 1999 was prolific at sites where plants had been growing. In the hierarchies of cause framework, the main causes of rarity for this species are taxon ecology, life-history strategy and stochasticity. Thus, concentrating active management on factors related to life history such as mosaic patch burning, fencing after fire to exclude vertebrate grazers, weed control and establishment of translocated populations will aid the preservation of this species in the wild. © CSIRO 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349231379

Here, we develop a computational algorithm for simultaneously estimating the recombination fraction and LD in a natural outcrossing population with multilocus marker data, which are often estimated separately in most molecular genetic studies. The algorithm is founded on a commonly used progeny test with open-pollinated offspring sampled from a natural population. The information about LD is reflected in the co-segregation of alleles at different loci among parents in the population. Open mating of parents will reveal the genetic linkage of alleles during meiosis. The algorithm was constructed within the polynomial-based mixture framework and implemented with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The by-product of the derivation of this algorithm is the estimation of outcrossing rate, a parameter useful to explore the genetic diversity of the population. We performed computer simulation to investigate the influences of different sampling strategies and different values of parameters on parameter estimation. By providing a number of testable hypotheses about population genetic parameters, this algorithmic model will open a broad gateway to understand the genetic structure and dynamics of an outcrossing population under natural selection. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249169369

It is utilized by commercial beekeepers as a food for honey bees for several reasons: to promote brood production, after bees have been moved for commercial pollination, and when field-gathered nectar sources are scarce. Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a heat-formed contaminant and is the most noted toxin to honey bees. Currently, there are no rapid field tests that would alert beekeepers of dangerous levels of HMF in HFCS or honey. In this study, the initial levels and the rates of formation of HMF at four temperatures were evaluated in U.S.-available HFCS samples. Different HFCS brands were analyzed and compared for acidity and metal ions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Levels of HMF in eight HFCS products were evaluated over 35 days, and the data were fit to polynomial and exponential equations, with excellent correlations. The data can be used by beekeepers to predict HMF formation on storage. Caged bee studies were conducted to evaluate the HMF dose-response effect on bee mortality. Finally, commercial bases such as lime, potash, and caustic soda were added to neutralize hydronium ion in HMF samples, and the rates of HMF formation were compared at 45°C. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",Apis mellifera; High-fructose corn syrup; HMF; Honey bees; Hydroxymethylfurfural,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349196352

The objects of the study were four ornamental, annual species of the Malvaceae family. Each were examined during three vegetation seasons. The species were: Alcea rosea L., Malope trifida Cav., Malva mauritiana L. and Malva moschata L. The observations were focused on the time and length of the flowering period. The observations were focused, as well, on some morphological features of the flowers and seed sets when allowed free access by pollinating insects, and when the flowers were isolated. In the climatic conditions of Lublin, the flowering period of the investigated species started in June or early July (Malope trifida) and lasted till late September (10.5-15.5 weeks). A single flower blooms for 2.5-5.5 days. During the vegetative season, one plant developed an average of 243-1374 flowers. The flowers consist of numerous stamens forming a staminal tube which encloses the gynoecium. Depending on the species, one flower develops an average of from 62.5 (Malva moschata) to 309.1 (Alcea rosea) stamens. The number of ovules in one flower fluctuated between 9.7 (Malva mauritiana) to 54.3 (Malope trifida). Seed setting was strictly dependent on insect pollination. When allowed free access by pollinating enthomofauna, the flowers of the examined malvaceous developed 70.5-89.7% of seeds.

The effect of weather and floral age on nectar volume, existence, and total and relative amounts of the various compounds was explored. The proportion of sugars was rather constant within a given species whereas the composition, number, and total quantity of amino acids showed great intraspecific and intra-plant variability; these nectar properties were independent of floral stage or meteorological conditions. Species belonging to the same subgenus displayed equivalent sugar ratios and similar total amount of amino acids, so these characteristics might be conservative in the genus. For all species, the amino acid concentration surpassed known values for their respective pollination syndromes, viz. bee and wasp-pollinated flowers. No relationship emerged between pollinators with different glossa length and nectars with distinct sugar ratios.

All of these can potentially affect the populational structure of native species. We analyzed genetic variability and populational structure of Melipona scutellaris, based on five microsatellite loci, using heterologous primers of M. bicolor. Samples were taken from 43 meliponaries distributed among 30 sites of four northeastern states of Brazil (Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia). Thirty-one alleles were found to be well distributed among the populations, with sizes ranging from 85 to 146 bp. In general, there was a variable distribution and frequency of alleles among populations, with either exclusive and/or fixed alleles at some sites. The population of Pernambuco was the most polymorphic, followed by Bahia, Alagoas and Sergipe. The heterozygosity was Ho = 0.36 on average, much lower than what has been reported for M. bicolor (Ho = 0.65). Most populations were not under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We found a higher variation within rather than among populations, indicating no genetic structuring in those bees maintained in meliponaries. This apparent homogenization may be due to intense beekeeping activity, including exchange of genetic material among beekeepers. Based on our findings, we recommend more studies of meliponaries and of wild populations in order to help orient management and conservation of these native pollinators.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70149099126

Plants often change the genome size and organization during evolution by rapid proliferation and deletion of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Precise transposon sequences throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and the trans-acting mutations affecting epigenetic states make it an ideal model organism with which to study transposon dynamics. Here we report the mobilization of various families of endogenous A. thaliana LTR retrotransposons identified through genetic and genomic approaches with high-resolution genomic tiling arrays and mutants in the chromatin-remodelling gene DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1). Using multiple lines of self-pollinated ddm1 mutant, we detected an increase in copy number, and verified this for various retrotransposons in a gypsy family (ATGP3) and copia families (ATCOPIA13, ATCOPIA21, ATCOPIA93), and also for a DNA transposon of a Mutator family, VANDAL21. A burst of retrotransposition occurred stochastically and independently for each element, suggesting an additional autocatalytic process. Furthermore, comparison of the identified LTR retrotransposons in related Arabidopsis species revealed that a lineage-specific burst of retrotransposition of these elements did indeed occur in natural Arabidopsis populations. The recent burst of retrotransposition in natural population is targeted to centromeric repeats, which is presumably less harmful than insertion into genes. The ddm1-induced retrotransposon proliferations and genome rearrangements mimic the transposon-mediated genome dynamics during evolution and provide experimental systems with which to investigate the controlling molecular factors directly. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349276670

High levels of pollen immigration from outside of the study plot were detected in both sampled seed-years (?49%) suggesting long distance pollen gene flow. Low levels of self-fertilization were also detected (?2%).

Patterns of pollen dispersal distance within the plot were also found to be shorter than the distances between potential male parents and seed-trees.

Sexual selection theory predicts that males are limited in their reproductive success by access to mates, whereas females are more limited by resources. In animal-pollinated plants, attraction of pollinators and successful pollination is crucial for reproductive success. In dioecious plant species, males should thus be selected to increase their attractiveness to pollinators by investing more than females in floral traits that enhance pollinator visitation. We tested the prediction of higher attractiveness of male flowers in the dioecious, moth-pollinated herb Silene latifolia, by investigating floral signals (floral display and fragrance) and conducting behavioral experiments with the pollinator-moth, Hadena bicruris. Results. As found in previous studies, male plants produced more but smaller flowers. Male flowers, however, emitted significantly larger amounts of scent than female flowers, especially of the pollinator-attracting compounds. In behavioral tests we showed that nave pollinator-moths preferred male over female flowers, but this preference was only significant for male moths. Conclusion. Our data suggest the evolution of dimorphic floral signals is shaped by sexual selection and pollinator preferences, causing sexual conflict in both plants and pollinators. © 2009 Waelti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69949114546

Older pods had a higher content of glucovanillin, vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde glucoside, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and sucrose, while younger pods had more bis[4-(?-D-glucopyranosyloxy)benzyl]-2- isopropyltartrate (glucoside A), bis[4-(?-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-benzyl]-2- (2-butyl)tartrate (glucoside B), glucose, malic acid, and homocitric acid. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis targeted at phenolic compound content was also performed on the developing pods and confirmed the NMR results. Ratios of aglycones/glucosides were estimated and thus allowed for detection of more minor metabolites in the green vanilla pods.

Both genotypes showed extremely high levels of total cytokinins during the very early stages of development, followed by a marked and genotype specific reduction. While the decrease of cytokinins in Mn1 was associated with their deactivation by 9-glucosylation, the absolute and the relative part of active cytokinin forms was higher in the mutant. During the exponential growth phase of endosperm between 6 d after pollination and 9 d after pollination, the mean cell doubling time, the absolute growth rate and the level of endoreduplication were similar in the two genotypes. However, the entire duration of growth was longer in Mn1 compared with mn1, resulting in a significantly higher cell number in the Mn1 endosperm. These data correlate with the previously reported peak levels of the Mn1-encoded cell wall invertase-2 (INCW2) at 12 d after pollination in the Mn1 endosperm.

As a consequence, tens of indices are available to address similar questions, differing in specific detail, sensitivity in detecting the property in question, and robustness with respect to network size and sampling intensity. Furthermore, some indices merely reflect the number of species participating in a network, but not their interrelationship, requiring a null model approach. Here we introduce a new, free software calculating a large spectrum of network indices, visualizing bipartite networks and generating null models. We use this tool to explore the sensitivity of 26 network indices to network dimensions, sampling intensity and singleton observations. Based on observed data, we investigate the interrelationship of these indices, and show that they are highly correlated, and heavily influenced by network dimensions and connectance. Finally, we re-evaluate five common hypotheses about network properties, comparing 19 pollination networks with three differently complex null models: 1. The number of links per species (""degree"") follow (truncated) power law distributions. 2. Generalist pollinators interact with specialist plants, and vice versa (dependence asymmetry). 3. Ecological networks are nested. 4. Pollinators display complementarity, owing to specialization within the network. 5. Plant-pollinator networks are more robust to extinction than random networks. Our results indicate that while some hypotheses hold up against our null models, others are to a large extent understandable on the basis of network size, rather than ecological interrelationships. In particular, null model pattern of dependence asymmetry and robustness to extinction are opposite to what current network paradigms suggest. Our analysis, and the tools we provide, enables ecologists to readily contrast their findings with null model expectations for many different questions, thus separating statistical inevitability from ecological process. © Dormann et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.",Connectance; Linkage density; Nestedness; Network; Pollination web; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549098123

The main goal of this synthesis for this special issue on the ecology and management of tropical dry forests in the Americas is to present a summarized review of the current knowledge of the ecology and management implications associated to TDF succession. We explore specific issues associated to tropical dry forest succession with emphasis on the use of chronosequences, plant diversity and composition, plant phenology and remote sensing, pollination, and animal-plant interactions; all under the integrating umbrella of ecosystem succession. We also emphasize the need to conduct socio-ecological research to understand changes in land-use history and its effects on succession and forest regeneration of TDF.

Nuclear male-sterile, female-fertile ms3 mutant is a single recessive gene and displays high outcrossed seed set with pollinators. Our objective was to map the ms3 locus. A segregating population of 150 F2 plants from Minsoy (PI 27890) × T284H, Ms3ms3 (A00-68), was screened with 231 simple sequence repeat markers.

Six Govenia species belonging to three groups characterized by different pollinator attraction strategies were studied: (a) small inflorescences with three to eight whitish or greenish flowers, (b) medium-sized inflorescences with 15-30 white flowers, and (c) large inflorescences with 30-50 or more yellowish flowers. Genetic variation was assessed using starch gel electrophoresis to resolve 17 allozyme loci in 13 populations, to determine the level and distribution of genetic variation, and to evaluate the association between genetic diversity and pollinator attraction strategy. A high level of genetic variation and a low genetic differentiation among species were found. The mean number of alleles per locus was higher among species with strategy c than species with strategy a (A = 2:23 vs. 2.0), and the genetic diversity within populations was higher among taxa with strategy a than with strategy c (Ho = 0:72 vs. 0.46), while population differentiation was lower for strategy a than for strategy c (Fst = 0:056 vs. 0.155). Our results suggest that the amount and distribution of genetic variation observed in Govenia are the result of incipient divergence and have been significantly affected by drift. Pollinator attraction strategy plays an important role in the genetic identity and genetic structure of Govenia and could be the main cause of the differences between species; the different strategies have an effect on reproductive success and therefore on gene flow. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Allozyme; Genetic diversity; Govenia capitata; Govenia dressleriana; Govenia mutica; Govenia purpusii; Govenia superba; Govenia tequilana; Orchidaceae; Pollinator attraction strategies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349171323

A spatially explicit approach is needed to develop specific recommendations regarding the design of agricultural landscapes to sustain wild pollinator communities and the services they provide. I modeled pollination services in agroecosystems using a pair of models: a stochastic individual-based simulation model of wild pollinators, pollinator-dependent plants, and crop pollination; and a set of coupled difference equations designed to capture the nonspatial component of the simulation model. Five spatially explicit models of habitat conversion to crops were simulated, and results for pollination services were compared. Mean-field behavior of the simulation model was in good agreement with analysis of the difference equations. A major feature of the models was the presence of a cusp leading to loss of stability and extinction of pollinators and pollinatordependent plants beyond a critical amount of habitat loss. The addition of pollen obtained from crop visitation caused a breakdown of the cusp preventing extinction of pollinators, but not of wild pollinator-dependent plants. Spatially restricted foraging and dispersal also altered model outcomes relative to mean-field predictions, in some cases causing extinction under parameter settings that would otherwise lead to persistence. Different patterns of habitat conversion to crops resulted in different levels of pollination services. Most interesting was the finding that optimal pollination services occurred when the size of remnant habitat patches was equal to half the mean foraging and dispersal distance of pollinators and the spacing between remnant patches was equal to the mean foraging and dispersal distance. Conservation of wild pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants in agroecosystems requires careful attention to thresholds in habitat conversion and spatial pattern and scale of remnant habitats. Maximization of pollination services was generally incompatible with conservation of wild pollinator-dependent plants. My prediction is that pollination services will be maximized by providing islands of nesting habitat where interisland distance matches mean foraging distances of wild pollinators. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Agroecosystems; Allee effect; Conservation; Difference equations; Ecosystem services; Habitat conversion; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape model; Mutualism; Pollination services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449103198

Most studies on diversity-functioning relationships have focused on ecosystem and community levels, leaving the extension of those relationships to other organization levels, such as populations, as a challenging and unsolved issue. Empirical studies have shown links between pollinator diversity and plant fecundity, suggesting that a diversity- functioning relationship at the population level may occur in pollination systems. We theoretically explored the effect of pollinator diversity on plant reproduction. We found that low pollinator diversity is beneficial when the most abundant pollinators are the most effective. In contrast, when the most effective pollinators are not the most abundant, we found an optimal value of pollinator diversity at which plant fecundity is maximized. When we parametrized our model with real data, we obtained that an increase in pollinator diversity was beneficial for the reproduction of some plants whereas it was harmful for other plants, the outcome depending exclusively on the differences in effectiveness among pollinators. Consequently, our theoretical approach suggests that in pollination systems the diversity-function relationship may be explained as the consequence of the interaction between among-pollinator differences in effectiveness and frequency of interaction, without the need to invoke additional ecological mechanisms.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549103198

Such variation reduces expected female and male success if seed production decelerates with increasing pollen receipt, because less than average receipt diminishes mean seed production more than copious pollination increases it (Jensen's inequality). We report empirical studies of the nature and magnitude of pollen dispersal variance, which provide the basis for a numerical model of the consequences of dispersal for expected seed production. Model fitting revealed that dispersal of Brassica napus pollen by bumblebees and especially butterflies exhibited much more variation than is expected of a binomial process and was best modeled as a beta-binomial process with a constant mean. Overdispersion arose primarily during pollen dispersal by individual insects, since differences between individuals of the same pollinator type were limited. Our model revealed, variance limitation as a previously unrecognized, substantial, and ubiquitous component of pollen limitation of seed production. Variance limitation should select for floral traits that increase pollinator visitation, reduce dispersal variance, or reduce the postpollination nonlinearities that cause Jensen's inequality. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Jensen's inequality; Model selection; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70149104832

Changes in the odor composition can lead to hybridization and speciation by the attraction of a new pollinator that acts as an isolation barrier toward other sympatrically occurring Ophrys species. On Sardinia, we investigated the evolutionary origin of two sympatrically occurring endemic species, Ophrys chestermanii and O. normanii, which are both pollinated by males of the cuckoo bumblebee Bombus vestalis. Chemical and electrophysiological analyses of floral scent and genetic analyses with amplified fragment length polymorphisms and plastid-markers clearly showed that O. normanii is neither a hybrid nor a hybrid species. The two species evolved from different ancestors, viz. O. normanii from O. tenthredinifera and O. chestermanii from O. annae, and converged to the same pollinator attracted by the same bouquet of polar compounds. In spite of sympatry, pollinator sharing and overlapping blooming periods, no evidence has been obtained for gene flow between O. chestermanii and O. normanii indicating an unusual case among sexually deceptive orchids in which postmating rather than premating reproductive isolation mechanisms strongly prevent interspecific gene flow. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Genetic analyses; Ophrys; Pollinator-attracting scent; Reproductive isolation; Sexual deception; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249165825

Pollination by wild insects is under-researched in the tropics, where many crops may require or benefit from wild pollinators. Papaya is a dioecious tree crop widely cultivated throughout the tropics. In East Africa, papaya is an important component of rural smallholder farming systems. Traditional agricultural systems are currently under stress due to landscape degradation. These trends are of special concern with respect to pollination services provided by wild insects. Investigation of the role of hawkmoths as pollinators of papaya on subsistence farms in Kenya was conducted over a period of 3 years. Hawkmoths were the most abundant and reliable visitors to both female pistillate and male staminate papaya flowers. Hawkmoths accounted for >95% of legitimate visits and xenogamous pollination of papaya flowers. Hippotion celerio, Nephele comma and Agrius convolvuli were the main pollinators. Sites in two districts with similar climates and natural vegetation, but different levels of habitat degradation were chosen for comparison of pollinators and pollination services. Hawkmoth abundance and visitation rates declined sharply with increasing distance of natural habitat patches from the crop. Fruit set was also reduced at sites with high levels of disturbance/poor agricultural practices. Natural habitat containing larval food plants and other nectar resources for hawkmoths therefore supports adjacent cultivated papaya with pollination services. Understanding the links between wild biodiversity, in this case pollinating hawkmoths, and agricultural productivity can help bridge the gap between agricultural development and biodiversity conservation. © 2009 ICIPE.",Agrius; Carica papaya; Hippotion; Nephele; Overlooked ecosystem services; Pollinator conservation; Sphingidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949121067

Solitary bees are the most important vectors, and among them members of the tribe Centridini depend on oil from flowers (mainly Malpighiaceae) to feed their larvae. This specialized relationship within 'the smallest of all worlds' (a whole pollination network) could result in a 'tiny world' different from the whole system. This 'tiny world' would have higher nestedness, shorter path lengths, lower modularity and higher resilience if compared with the whole pollination network. In the present study, we contrasted a network of oil-flowers and their visitors from a Brazilian steppe ('caatinga') to whole pollination networks from all over the world. A network approach was used to measure network structure and, finally, to test fragility. The oil-flower network studied was more nested (NODF = 0·84, N = 0·96) than all of the whole pollination networks studied. Average path lengths in the two-mode network were shorter (one node, both for bee and plant one-mode network projections) and modularity was lower (M = 0·22 and four modules) than in all of the whole pollination networks. Extinctions had no or small effects on the network structure, with an average change in nestedness smaller than 2% in most of the cases studied; and only two species caused coextinctions. The higher the degree of the removed species, the stronger the effect and the higher the probability of a decrease in nestedness. We conclude that the oil-flower subweb is more cohesive and resilient than whole pollination networks. Therefore, the Malpighiaceae have a robust pollination service in the Neotropics. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that each ecological service is in fact a mosaic of different subservices with a hierarchical structure ('webs within webs'). © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Community structure; Melittophyly; Modules; Mutualism; Subwebs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149114136

Bumblebee workers were exposed under laboratory conditions to each MCA at its maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) via three different routes of exposure: dermal contact and orally via either treated sugar water or pollen. RESULTS: The tested MCAs were found to be safe for workers of B. terrestris, with the exception of Botanigard® and Serenade®. Exposure to Botanigard® via contact at its MFRC caused 92% mortality after 11 weeks, while the 1/10 MFRC killed 46% of exposed workers. For Serenade®, topical contact and oral delivery via sugar water resulted in 88 and 100% worker mortality respectively. With lower concentrations (1/2, 1/5 and 1/10 MFRC) the toxicity decreased, but the effect depended on the route of exposure. In addition to lethal effects, nests were also evaluated for sublethal effects after treatment with the seven MCAs at their respective MFRCs over 11 weeks. In these bioassays, only Botanigard® and Serenade® gave rise to a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in drone production. Sublethal effects on foraging behaviour were also evaluated, and only Botanigard at its MFRC delivered via treated sugar water induced negative effects. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that most of the MCAs tested can be considered safe for use in combination with B. terrestris, based on the International Organisation for Biological Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC) classification.

The effect of breeding system on seed viability and germinability and seedling development was also investigated. Incidences of spontaneous autogamy in E. alta were rare at the study site, resulting in only 7.1% of observed flowers forming capsules. In addition, hand pollination resulted in significantly greater capsule formation when flowers were subjected to induced autogamy (46.4%), artificial geitonogamy (64.3%) and xenogamy at both short (pollen source 10-100 m away; 42.9%) and long (pollen source > 10 km away; 67.9%) distances. Pollen source had little effect on seed viability and germinability or seedling growth rates. However, seed resulting from spontaneous autogamy developed more slowly than seed originating from the other treatments. These data indicate that spontaneous autogamy is rare in E. alta and that naturally forming capsules may be the result of unobserved pollination events. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 161, 78-88.",Asymbiotic germination; Auto-pollination; Breeding system; Crossing distance; Fitness; Optimal out; Orchid; Sexual reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350149972

Here, we contrast the impact of two kinds of pollinators on reproductive success via male and female functions in the Rocky Mountain columbine, Aquilegia coerulea. We set up pollinator exclusion treatments in each of three patches where Aquilegia plants were visited by either day pollinators (majority bumble bees), by evening pollinators (hawkmoths), or by both (control). Day pollinators collected pollen and groomed, whereas evening pollinators collected nectar but did not groom. Maternal parents, potential fathers and progeny arrays were genotyped at five microsatellite loci. We estimated female outcrossing rate and counted seeds to measure female reproductive success and used paternity analysis to determine male reproductive success. Our results document that bumble bees frequently moved pollen among patches of plants and that, unlike hawkmoths, pollen moved by bumble bees sired more outcrossed seeds when it remained within a patch as opposed to moving between patches. Pollinator type differentially affected the outcrossing rate but not seed set, the number of outcrossed seeds or overall male reproductive success. Multiple visits to a plant and more frequent visits by bumble bees could help to explain the lack of impact of pollinator type on overall reproductive success. The increase in selfing rate with hawkmoths likely resulted from the abundant pollen available in experimental flowers.

However, under field conditions stochastic pollen arrival times may result in disproportionate fertilization success of the first-arriving pollen, even to the detriment of the recipient plant's and offspring fitness. It is therefore critical to evaluate the relative importance of arrival times of pollen from different donors in determining siring success. Methods Hand pollinations and genetic markers were used to investigate experimentally the effect of pollination timing on seed paternity, seed mass and stigmatic wilting in the the dioecious plant Silene latifolia. In this species, high prevalence of multiply-sired fruits in natural populations suggests that competition among different donors may often take place (at fertilization or during seed development); however, the role of variation due to pollen arrival times is not known. Key Results First-arriving pollen sired significantly more seeds than later-arriving pollen. This advantage was expressed already before the first pollen tubes could reach the ovary. Simultaneously with pollen tube growth, the stigmatic papillae wilted visibly. Individual seeds were heavier in fruits where one donor sired most seeds than in fruits where both donors had more even paternity shares. Conclusions In field populations of S. latifolia, fruits are often multiply-sired. Because later-arriving pollen had decreased chances of fertilizing the ovules, this implies that open-pollinated flowers often benefit from pollen carry-over or pollinator visits within short time intervals, which may contribute to increase offspring genetic diversity and fitness.",Microsatellite DNA; Paternity; Pollen; Pollen tube growth; Reproduction; Reproductive success; Seed mass; Silene alba; Siring success; Stigma wilting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249222662

This prediction is based on the idea that these reproductive traits should confer resistance to Allee effects in founder populations and was tested using Gomphocarpus physocarpus (Asclepiadoideae: Apocynaceae), a species native to South Africa that is invasive in other parts of the world. We found no significant relationships between the size of G. physocarpus populations and various measures of pollination success (pollen deposition, pollen removal and pollen transfer efficiency) and fruit set. A breeding system experiment showed that plants in a South African population are genetically self-incompatible and thus obligate outcrossers. Outcrossing is further enhanced by mechanical reconfiguration of removed pollinaria before the pollinia can be deposited. Self-pollination is reduced when such reconfiguration exceeds the average duration of pollinator visits to a plant. Observations suggest that a wide variety of wasp species in the genera Belonogaster and Polistes (Vespidae) are the primary pollinators. We conclude that efficient pollination of plants in small founding populations, resulting from their generalist wasp-pollination system, contributes in part to the colonizing success of G. physocarpus.

But when and where did pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae) originate? Some studies suggest that agaonids arose in the Late Cretaceous and the current distribution of fig-wasp faunas can be explained by the break-up of the Gondwanan landmass. However, recent molecular-dating studies suggest divergence time estimates that are inconsistent with the Gondwanan vicariance hypothesis and imply that long distance oceanic dispersal could have been an important process for explaining the current distribution of both figs and fig wasps. Here, we use a combination of phylogenetic and biogeographical data to infer the age, the major period of diversification, and the geographic origin of pollinating fig wasps. Age estimates ranged widely depending on the molecular-dating method used and even when using the same method but with slightly different constraints, making it difficult to assess with certainty a Gondwanan origin of agaonids. The reconstruction of ancestral areas suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all extant fig-pollinating wasps was most likely Asian, although a southern Gondwana origin cannot be rejected. Our analysis also suggests that dispersal has played a more important role in the development of the fig-wasp biota than previously assumed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Mathematical method: An adaptive dynamics model including the ecological dynamics of a plant-seed-eating pollinator mutualistic System. Key assumptions: Plants are initially pollinated by specialist seed-eating pollinators and by generalist co-pollinators. Plant specialization (floral morphology continuously ranging from closed to open) and seed-eating pollinator morphological preference co-evolve, while co-pollinators always prefer open flowers. When seed-eating pollinators and co-pollinators have similar preferences, seed-eating pollinators are less effective. The functional relationship linking plants and seed-eating pollinators involves pollination efficiency, oviposition rate, the range of floral morphologies an insect is able to deal with (its degree of specialization), and the pollination and oviposition handling times. Conclusions: Specialization evolves only if pollinators interfere, and it is favoured when co-pollinators' efficiency is low, when seed-eating pollinators' oviposition rate is low, and when the ränge of floral morphology they deal with is greater for oviposition than for nectar- or mate-searching visits. Moreover, although high pollination efficiency of seed-eating pollinators is a key factor in the persistence of the specific mutualism nowadays, the first steps of the evolution of specialization require an intermediate pollination efficiency of seed-eating pollinators. © 2009 Sébastien Ibanex.",Adaptive dynamics; Co-pollination efficiency; Evolution; Floral morphology; Trollius europaeus-chiastocheta mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350179483

Reina Mercedes 9, 41012 Sevilla, Spain","Background and Aims The phenotypic selection of a diverse insect assemblage was studied on a generalist plant species (Paeonia broteroi) in ten flowering seasons, with tests for whether visitor preferences for plants with larger flowers eventually translated into significant differences among plants in visitation rates, seed production, seed mass, seed germination and seedling survival. Methods Selection gradients were used to assess if selection on flower size contributed to explain differences in visitation rates, seed production and seed mass. First, independent analyses were carried out for each season; then for the ten season as a whole. Seedling emergence and survival were assessed by generalized linear models. Key Results Directional selection was found on flower size through visitation rates and seed production, and stabilizing selection through seed mass. Thus, larger flowers were more visited, and produced more, but lighter seeds, than smaller flowers. The results suggest a conflicting selection on flower size through seed number and size. Floral integration found in the study populations was larger than that in populations of a distant region. Finally, seed size did not influence seedling emergence and survival; thus, any advantages of seed size may be constrained under natural conditions before plants become reproductive individuals. Conclusions Plants with larger flowers may be benefited by producing more lighter seeds than fewer heavier ones, as they may contribute disproportionately to the seed bank, and have better chances that any descendant could eventually recruit. However, it seems unlikely that differences in flower size and integration found among populations in different regions could have been originated by rapid evolutionary change. First, because of the conflicting selection described; second, because of the remarkably low seedling survival found under natural conditions. Consequently, the influence of pollinator selection alone does not seem to explain differences in flower size and integration.",Conflicting selection; Flower size; Generalist pollination; Long-term selection; Paeonia broteroi; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249221384

We constructed plots of 200 m 5 m in two distinct habitats on the islands of Dominica, Grenada and Puerto Rico (total of six plots) and recorded visitors to all plant species in flower. In total we recorded 447 interactions among 144 plants and 226 pollinator species. Specifically we describe how rainfall and temperature affect proportional richness and importance of the different pollinator functional groups. We used three measures of pollinator importance: number of interactions, number of plant species visited and betweenness centrality. Overall rainfall explained most of the variation in pollinator richness and relative importance. Bird pollination tended to increase with rainfall, although not significantly, whereas insects were significantly negatively affected by rainfall. However, the response among insect groups was more complex; bees were strongly negatively affected by rainfall, whereas dipterans showed similar trends to birds. Bird, bee and dipteran variation along the climate gradient can be largely explained by their physiological capabilities to respond to rainfall and temperature, but the effect of climate on other insect pollinator groups was more obscure. This study contributes to the understanding of how climate may affect neotropical plant-pollinator communities. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",Bees; Betweenness centrality; Birds; Diptera; Functional groups; Insects; Mutualisms; Plantanimal interactions; Rainfall; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69749123540

First, we investigated ecological determinants of reproductive success (seed set and germination) of both seeds collected from the trees (tree seeds) and dispersed seeds collected from seed traps (dispersed seeds). We then evaluated the effects of population density on seed set and germination of tree seeds and dispersed seeds using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Subsequently, we genotyped 950 seeds collected from mother trees and 940 seeds trapped after dispersal derived from tree seeds and dispersed seeds, respectively, using eleven microsatellite loci. Using the acquired data, we then evaluated the outcrossing rate and effective number of pollen donors (Nep) of the tree seeds, and the genetic structure of both pollen pools and dispersed seed populations. The seed set and germination rate of dispersed seeds was significantly lower both in the lowest-density stand and in the highest-density stand. The GLMM revealed that seed set and germination rates of dispersed seeds may be maximal at approximately 120 trees per hectare (optimal density). Outcrossing rates were consistently high (tm = 0.995), regardless of the population density. In contrast, Nep was lower in the lowest-density stands. Significant genetic structure of the dispersed seed population was found in two low-density stands, probably due to the limitation of overlapping seed shadows. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Genetic structure; GLMM; Landscape; Mating system; Pollen pool,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350558745

Measurements of respiration within a range of Ta showed that active beetles became spontaneously endothermic at Ta below 28°C but were rarely endothermic above it. There was no evidence of endothermy within the inflorescences, indicating that activities in the floral chamber can occur without the high energy expense of endothermy. Bouts of endothermy occurred at lower Ta in respirometer chambers mainly in the evening, when the insects normally fly from one inflorescence to another, and during the night, when they normally eat and mate within the inflorescence. Patterns of endothermy in individual episodes were studied in non-flying beetles with respirometry and infrared thermal imaging. Heat was generated in the thorax by oscillatory waves of respiration that were coupled with thoracic temperature (Tth) increases. Stationary beetles could regulate T th at about 33°C independently of Ta between 16 and 29°C. At Ta=20°C, this represents a 116-fold increase in metabolic rate over resting, ectothermic values. Endothermy was clearly a requirement for flight, and beetles departing inflorescences warmed to about 30°C before take-off. During flight, Tth was dependent on T a, decreasing from 37 to 28°C at Ta of 37 to 20°C, respectively. The lowest Ta at which flight could occur was about 20°C.

The ovule is approximately 5.5-6 cm long and 2.4-3 cm wide at the mid-point with three commissured primary ribs, three secondary ribs expressed at the apex, and a large number of sclerotesta ridges (18-24 between each primary rib-secondary rib pair), formed from interwoven bands of fibers. The micropyle, defined by the epidermal cuticle of the endotesta, is flared at the tip and triangular in cross section. A collar of sclerotesta and sarcotesta, 10 mm tall surrounds the micropyle. The space enclosed by the collar is a triangular prism, with a primary rib at each edge and sides approximately 2.3 mm in length. The space between the micropyle and the sclerotesta-sarcotesta collar appears to have been filled with thin-walled endotesta cells. At the ovule apex, lobes of sarcotesta associated with the primary ribs partially occlude the top of the collar, forming a triangular opening with the flared tip of the micropyle in the center. Pachytesta crenulata appears most similar to P. composita and P. illinoensis. All three ovules have tertiary ribs or ridges and secretory fibers in the sclerotesta; in both P. illinoensis and P. crenulata a collar of sclerotesta and sarcotesta surrounds the micropyle. Based on these similarities, we place P. crenulata in Taylor's [Taylor, T.N., 1965. Paleozoic seed studies: a monograph of the American species of Pachytesta.

Ovules having hollow fibers in the sclerotesta and nucellar stalks with a convex profile appear immature relative to ovules with filled fibers in the sclerotesta and deeply invaginated nucellar stalks. Although the pollination and fertilization status of most P. crenulata ovules remains equivocal, one mature ovule probably was pollinated.

Therefore, periods of low pollen receipt may favor evolutionary shifts from cross-fertilization to self-fertilization. Although reproductive assurance is hypothesized to be important in mating system evolution, it has been quantified in relatively few species. Leptosiphon jepsonii shows variation in the mode of selfing, with transient self-incompatibility conferring delayed selfing seen in some individuals and early self-compatibility present in others. Autofertility, reproductive assurance, and pollen limitation were quantified in three populations of L. jepsonii that vary in the timing of self-compatibility and rate of self-fertilization. Plants in all three populations were capable of high seed set through autonomous self-fertilization, and selfing provided significant reproductive assurance in two populations, including one with the highest frequency of delayed selfing. Confidence intervals revealed no difference in reproductive assurance among populations. We conclude that both early and delayed self-compatibility can confer reproductive assurance and alleviate pollen limitation in this species.

We examined the reproduction of a common tallgrass prairie forb, Amorpha canescens (Fabaceae), in large (>40 ha) and small (<2 ha) prairie remnants in Iowa and Minnesota in relation to the diversity and abundance of its bee visitors, plant population size, and species density of the forb flowering community. We found significant positive effects of the diversity of bees visiting A. canescens on percent fruit set at a site in both years of the study and in 2002 an additional significant positive effect of plant species density. Abundance of bees visiting A. canescens had a significant positive effect on percent fruit set in 2002, but was only marginally significant in 2003. In 2003 but not 2002, the plant species density at the sites had a significant negative effect on the diversity and abundance of bees visiting A. canescens, indicating community-level characteristics can influence the bee community visiting any one species.

This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (<15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350452934

PCR amplification of the S-RNase gene in self-pollinated progeny of Yan Zhuang and Jin Zhui show that they contain point mutations in the stylar S(21) allele and pollen S(34) allele, respectively. The cDNA sequence of the Yan Zhuang stylar S-RNase gene revealed that the 182nd nucleotide of the S(21)-RNase (cDNA) sequence had been substituted resulting in a Gly to Val mutation, and this might affect the stability of the S-RNase. In addition, Western blotting showed that one Yan Zhuang stylar S-RNase was absent and the expression level of another S-RNase protein was decreased compared to Ya Li. Therefore, we suggest that the self-compatibility of Yan Zhuang is caused by a point mutation in an S(21)-RNase nucleotide.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350465295

However, interfertile oak species often seem to remain distinct, even within areas of sympatry. This study employed molecular markers to verify, at a fine scale, the presence of interspecific gene flow in a natural population of Quercus petraea and Quercus pubescens. Within a delimited area of 6 ha, all adult trees belonging to the studied oak complex and seeds from a subsample of such trees were collected and analysed using molecular microsatellite markers. A low interspecific genetic differentiation and a high level of interspecific genetic admixture suggested past hybridisation. Paternity inference of seeds allowed the estimation of pollination frequencies from the three groups of pollen donors (Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, intermediate). We also assayed pollen viability and germinability of each species group. We observed natural hybridisation between Q. petraea and Q. pubescens, with a predominant component in the direction Q. petraea --> Q. pubescens: Q. pubescens displayed a higher level of heterospecific pollination by Q. petraea (25.8%) and intermediate morphotypes (14.7%), compared to Q. petraea acting as pollen receptor (with less than 5% heterospecific pollinations). Intermediate 'mother trees' were pollinated in similar proportions by Q. petraea (23.1%), Q. pubescens (37.8%) and intermediate morphotypes (39.1%). The asymmetrical introgression observed for the studied generation may be caused, among other factors, by the relative abundance of trees from each species group in the studied area.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350443770

Most hypotheses assume that changed ecological interactions, especially enemy release, allow species to become invasive. This paper investigates how the release from a specialist frugivore may lead to relaxed selection on avoidance and defence strategies in an invasive plant. Silene latifolia was introduced from Europe to North America where its main enemies are absent. Reintroduced North American plants suffer greater damage than European plants by their specialist frugivore Hadena bicruris, which lays eggs in flowers. However, the mechanism is unclear: increased oviposition preference, decreased defence leading to higher egg and larval survival, or a closer phenological match. We exposed plants from European and North American populations to this enemy by allowing natural oviposition and also by manually adding eggs. We recorded reproductive traits potentially associated with interactions with the seed predator and monitored the different stages of fruit attack (oviposition, larval growth and survival) to study the relative roles of increased attractiveness versus decreased defence. North American plants received significantly more eggs (40.2 ± 2.1 eggs per plant) than European plants (28.4 ± 3.0 eggs per plant) and natural fruit predation was twice as high on North American than on European plants. Oviposition preference rates for North American over European plants persisted also after variation in flower size and phenology were accounted for. European and North American plants did not differ significantly in larval survival, larval mass at emergence or in the rate of defensive fruit abscission, indicating that greater susceptibility of plants from the introduced range to the seed predator is largely due to an increased preference for oviposition rather than to changes in palatability or defence after oviposition. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that introduced plants may evolve after introduction, if evolutionary constraints such as those imposed by plant-frugivore interactions, are broken down in the invasive range. For S. latifolia, release from its native predator H. bicruris may have allowed evolution of increased attractiveness to pollinators without the burden of attracting the frugivore. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Biological invasions; Caryophyllaceae; Common garden; Enemy release; Floral morphology; Hadena bicruris; Invasive plants; Nursery pollination; Pre-dispersal seed predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849129974

The nectaries are derived from septal nectaries by extensive convolution of the carpel flank surfaces below the ovary throughout the inner floral base thus also encompassing the inner surface of the corolla-androecium tube. A comparison with septalnectaries elsewhere in Arecaceae and with labyrinthine nectaries in other monocots shows that labyrinthine nectaries situated below the ovary as described here are not known from any other palms but are similar to those of a few Bromeliaceae and less strongly convoluted some Haemodoraceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae. In addition the substantial participation of parts other than the gynoecium in the nectary architecture of Licuala appears unique at the level of monocots. © 2009 IEEE.,Development; Flowers; Labyrinthine septal nectaries; Morphology; Palm anatomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350157030

It has been traditionally assumed that LMC organisms adjust the sex ratio by laying a greater proportion of male eggs when there is superparasitism (several foundresses in a host). We tested the assumption with two wasp species, Pegoscapus silvestrii, pollinator of Ficus pertusa and Pegoscapus tonduzi, pollinator of Ficus eximia (= F. citrifolia), in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Total number of wasps and seeds were recorded in individual isolated naturally colonized syconia. There was a constant additive effect between the number of foundresses and the number of males produced in the brood of a syconium, while the number of females decreased. Both wasp species seem to have precise sex ratios and probably lay the male eggs first in the sequence, independently of superparasitism and clutch size: consequently, they have a non-random sex allocation. Each syconium of Ficus pertusa and of F. eximia colonized by one foundress had similar mean numbers of females, males, and seeds. The two species of wasps studied do not seem to adjust the sex ratio when there is superparasitism. Pollinating fig wasp behavior is better explained by those models not assuming that females do mathematical calculations according to other females' sex ratios, size, number of foundresses, genetic constitution, clutch size or environmental conditions inside the syconium.

The seed also contains a deadly toxin known as ricin (RCA60) and the less toxic Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120) in addition to potentially harmful allergens. Using Western blotting, an antibody screening technique, ricin content was evaluated in various plant parts with a ricin A-chain specific antibody. Seed, cotyledon, root, hypocotyl, and leaf tissues were tested. Western blot results indicated that ricin is only present in the seed. In order to determine when ricin accumulates in the seed, reproductive tissue samples were harvested during seed development and upon germination. Developing seed were collected from inflorescences in 4-day intervals beginning with the day of pollination (day 0) until the seed had fully matured (day 44). Ricin was absent from the developing seed throughout development until the 28th day post-pollination. Ricin content quickly increased as the seed matured and the capsule dehydrated. Mature seed were also germinated and collected at 2-day intervals once radicle emergence began, until the 12th day, when seedlings were fully expanded. From the sixth day forward, germinating seedlings were dissected into root, hypocotyl, and cotyledonary tissue. Western blot analysis indicated that after the 6th day, ricin is degraded below levels of detection. Ricin is only detectable in the seed tissue from day 0 (ungerminated seed) through the sixth day after radicle emergence and is not detected in any of the root, hypocotyl, or cotyledonary tissue. These data suggest that ricin is generated and stored in the seed for a specific purpose; most likely the protection of the seed from predation in its quiescent state. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We used Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed; Asteraceae), a successful invasive angiosperm, to investigate the effect of clumping on wind dispersal of pollen under natural conditions in a large field. Results of simultaneous measurements of clump size both in pollen shedding from male flowers and airborne pollen being dispersed in the atmosphere are combined with a transport model to show that rather than being detrimental, clumps may actually be advantageous for wind pollination.

Female solitary bees, megachilids and Centris, and their nest pollen provisions were monitored with trap nests over a 17-year period in a tropical Mexican biosphere reserve. Invasion by feral Apis (i.e. Africanized honey bees) occurred after the study began, and major droughts and hurricanes occurred throughout. Honey bee competition, and ostensibly pollination of native plants, caused changes in local pollination ecology. Shifts in floral hosts by native bees were common and driven by plant phylogenetics, whereby plants of the same families or higher taxa were substituted for those dominated by honey bees or lost as a result of natural processes. Two important plant families, Anacardiaceae and Euphorbiaceae, were lost to competing honey bees, but compensated for by greater use of Fabaceae, Rubiaceae, and Sapotaceae among native bees. Natural disasters made a large negative impact on native bee populations, but the sustained presence of Africanized honey bees did not. Over 171 plant species comprised the pollen diets of the honey bees, including those most important to Centris and megachilids (72 and 28 species, respectively).

Here, we analyse data on abundance, juvenile recruitment, pollination mode and genetic variation and structure in both species. We find that Howea forsteriana is less abundant than Howea belmoreana. The genetic data based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms markers indicate similar levels of variation in the two species, despite the estimated census population size of H. belmoreana being three times larger than that of H. forsteriana.

Linum cratericola (Linaceae) was first discovered in 1966 at two sites on Floreana Island, Galápagos. It has since disappeared from one site and survives in three groups of plants at the other, where it has been threatened with extinction by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. Population size, and growth rate and mortality of individual plants, have been monitored since 1997. The population appears highly responsive to changes in threat levels: the three plant groups increased rapidly following protection by fencing and ungulate control, but temporarily declined when feral goat pressure increased and during dry periods. Natural factors that may contribute to population limitation include dry years, grazing by native snails and competition from native vascular plants and cryptogams. Linum cratericola has a single flowering period per year and produces abundant seed with 28% germination after scarification, but with no obvious adaptations for long-distance dispersal. Potential pollinators included the butterfly Leptotes parrhasioides, the hoverfly Toxomerus crockeri and the carpenter bee Xylocopa darwinii, all endemic to Galápagos. The continued survival of L. cratericola in the wild depends on effective protection from introduced herbivores and invasive plants. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 161, 89-102.",Conservation; Introduced ungulates; Island endemic; Phenology; Pollination; Population dynamics; Seed production; Threatened plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350191431

In this study, the genetic diversity and structure was assessed within and among remnant populations of the critically endangered sexually deceptive orchid, Caladenia huegelii. This species has experienced severe recent habitat loss in a landscape marked by ancient patterns of population fragmentation within the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, a global biodiversity hotspot. Using seven polymorphic microsatellite loci, high levels of within-population diversity (mean alleles/locus = 6.73; mean HE = 0.690), weak genetic structuring among 13 remnant populations (FST = 0.047) and a consistent deficit of heterozygotes from Hardy-Weinberg expectation were found across all populations (mean FIS = 0.22). Positive inbreeding coefficients are most likely due to Wahlund effects and/or inbreeding effects from highly correlated paternity and typically low fruit set. Indirect estimates of gene flow (Nm = 5.09 using FST; Nm = 3.12 using the private alleles method) among populations reflects a historical capacity for gene flow through long distance pollen dispersal by sexually deceived wasp pollinators and/or long range dispersal of dust-like orchid seed. However, current levels of gene flow may be impacted by habitat destruction, fragmentation and reduced population size. A genetically divergent population was identified, which should be a high priority for conservation managers. Very weak genetic differentiation indicates that the movement and mixing of seeds from different populations for reintroduction programs should result in minimal negative genetic effects. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Caladenia; Conservation; Fragmentation; Microsatellites; Orchids; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350557675

Females of C. sandakana sp. nov. from North Borneo are similar to the mainland species C. chalybea, but differ mainly in the clypeal keel and the length of the antennal segments. The small blackish species, C. cornuta, is distributed in Myanmar, China and Taiwan and C. davidi is distributed in China, Russia and Taiwan; both species are seen at the flowers of Thladiantha. Ctenoplectra chalybea was collected from the Malay Peninsula, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam. Ctenoplectra apicalis Smith and C. kelloggi Cockerell are allied to C. chalybea; however, C. kelloggi is excluded from this study due to insufficient material.

The nest architecture prevents rain and direct sunlight from entering the nest. Bees used pre-existing holes or crevices in wood for nesting shelters and collected soil and appeared to mix it with some other substance to build nests.

Reciprocal specializations occur when (say) a pollinator (or group of pollinators) specializes on a particular flower species (or group of such species) and vice versa. Such specializations tend to group species into guilds. We characterize the level of reciprocal specialization for both antagonistic interactions - particularly parasitoids and their hosts - and mutualistic ones - such as insects and the flowers that they pollinate. We also examine whether trophic patterns might be 'palimpsests'- that is, there might be reciprocal specialization within taxonomically related species within a network, but these might be obscured when these relationships are combined.

We quantified bee communities in five pairs of crop-country: buckwheat in Poland, cantaloupe in France, field beans in the UK, spring oilseed rape in Sweden, and strawberries in Germany. For each country, 7-10 study fields were sampled over a gradient of increasing proportion of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. The CORINE land cover classification was used to characterize the landscape over a 3 km radius around each study field and we used multivariate and regression analyses to quantify the impact of landscape features on bee abundance and diversity at the sub-generic taxonomic level. Neither overall wild bee abundance nor diversity, taken as the number of sub-genera, was significantly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitat. Therefore, we used the most precise level of the CORINE classification to examine the possible links between specific landscape features and wild bee communities. Bee community composition fell into three distinct groups across Europe: group 1 included Poland, Germany, and Sweden, group 2 the UK, and group 3 France. Among all three groups, wild bee abundance and sub-generic diversity were affected by 17 landscape elements including some semi-natural habitats (e.g., transitional woodland-shrub), some urban habitats (e.g., sport and leisure facilities) and some crop habitats (e.g., non-irrigated arable land). Some bee taxa were positively affected by urban habitats only, others by semi-natural habitats only, and others by a combination of semi-natural, urban and crop habitats. Bee sub-genera favoured by urban and crop habitats were more resistant to landscape change than those favoured only by semi-natural habitats. In agroecosystems, the agricultural intensification defined as the loss of semi-natural habitats does not necessarily cause a decline in evenness at the local level, but can change community composition towards a bee fauna dominated by common taxa. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the objective of the study was to assess preand postzygotic barriers through pollen-pistil interaction between cultivated Jatropha curcas and other three wild Jatropha species. In this study, the cross J. curcas × J. gossypifolia, even though the pollen tubes reached ovaries after pollination, failed to produce seeds, and the cross between J. curcas × J. podagrica indicated incompatibility signs of bulged pollen tubes coupled with reverse direction of pollen tube growth. The interspecific cross of J. curcas with J. villosa showed crossability barriers of crinkled and twisted growth pattern of pollen tubes and failed to reach ovary.

Forest fragmentation can modify gene flow and reduce genetic diversity. Selective logging can reduce the density of trees, thereby altering mating patterns and increasing inbreeding. The hypothesis of the present study is that forest fragmentation will not increase inbreeding and will have no effect on genetic diversity parameters in the Canadian Pinus moniticola and P. strobus populations targeted because of (i) the long life span of the pine species, (ii) outbreeding and self-incompatibility of P. monticola and P. strobus and (iii) wind pollination resulting in high gene flow among populations. We studied the genetic diversity of P. strobus across its range in Canada, and we completed a detailed analysis of the genetic structure of P. monticola populations from western Canada using microsatellites genetic markers. Methods Seed samples from 10 P. monticola populations and 10 P. strobus populations were collected from western and eastern Canada, respectively. The mother trees included in seed lots were representative of each stand. Genomic DNA extracted from each sample was amplified with microsatellite primers. The intra- and interpopulation genetic diversity parameters were assessed using Popgene and Genepop softwares and the genetic distances among populations within each species using the PowerMarker software. Important findings Pinus monticola and P. strobus exhibited moderate to high genetic diversity. Also, both species showed low levels of inbreeding despite the geographic isolation and small stand size. Gene flow estimates were high and population differentiation values were relatively low for these fragmented forest sites.",Forest fragmentation; Genetic diversity; Microsatellite; Pinus monticola; Pinus strobus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949470330

In order to gain a greater understanding of the population genetic structure and the genetic diversity of this species, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial COI gene corresponding to the ""DNA Barcode"" region (658 bp) from 160 individuals collected over 15 Korean localities. Uncorrected pairwise distances among the eight haplotypes suggested low intraspecific genetic diversity, with a maximum sequence divergence of 0.3%. Such a low level of intraspecific genetic diversity was further reflected in local populations, particularly to islet populations, such as those of Youngheungdo, Jakyakdo, and Ulleugdo, which had zero genetic diversity. Geographically, one haplotype (BARBA01) was widespread and dominant, with a frequency of 90.6% (145 among 160 individuals). Other haplotypes were restricted to one to three localities and had low frequency. Overall, a very high rate of per generation female migration ratio (Nm = 4.6 to infinite) and a very low level of genetic fixation (FST = 0 to 0.099) were detected between pairs of localities, suggesting that the B. ardens populations on the Korean peninsula are panmictic, which is consistent with our understanding of their dispersal capability. © 2009 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.",Bombus ardens; Bumblebee; COI gene; DNA barcode; Genetic diversity; Geographic variation; Hymenoptera; Mitochondrial DNA; Population genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149091124

Angiosperms are unique among seed plants in the width of this spectrum. Xylem patterns are considered here to be indicative of contemporary function, not relictual. Nevertheless, most families of early-divergent angiosperms exhibit paedomorphic xylem structure, a circumstance that is most plausibly explained by the concept that early angiosperms had sympodial growth forms featuring limited accumulation of secondary xylem. Sympodial habits have been retained in various ways not only in early-divergent angiosperms, but also among eudicots in Ranunculales. The early angiosperm vessel, relatively marginal in conductive abilities, was improved in various ways, with concurrent redesign of parenchyma and fibre systems to enhance conductive, storage and mechanical capabilities. Flexibility in degree of cambial activity and kinds of juvenile/adult expressions has been basic to diversification in eudicots as a whole. Sympodial growth that lacks cambium, such as in monocots, provides advantages by various features, such as organographic compartmentalization of tracheid and vessel types. Woody monopodial eudicots were able to diversify as a result of production of new solutions to embolism prevention and conductive efficiency, particularly in vessel design, but also in parenchyma histology. Criteria for paedomorphosis in wood include slow decrease in length of fusiform cambial initials, predominance of procumbent ray cells and lesser degrees of cambial activity. Retention of ancestral features in primary xylem (the 'refugium' effect) is, in effect, a sort of inverse evidence of acceleration of adult patterns in later formed xylem. Xylem heterochrony is analysed not only for all key groups of angiosperms (including monocots), but also for different growth forms, such as lianas, annuals, various types of perennials, rosette trees and stem succulents. Xylary phenomena that potentially could be confused with heterochrony are discussed. Heterochronous xylem features seem at least as important as other often cited factors (pollination biology) because various degrees of paedomorphic xylem are found in so many growth forms that relate in xylary terms to ecological sites. Xylem heterochrony can probably be accessed during evolution by relatively simple gene changes in a wide range of angiosperms and thus represents a current as well as a past source of variation upon which diversification was based. Results discussed here are compatible with both current molecular-based phylogenetic analyses and all recent physiological work on conduction in xylem and thus represent an integration of these fields. © 2009 IEEE.",Basal angiosperms; Gene action; Juvenilism; Monocots; Monopodial growth; Neoteny; Paedomorphosis; Progenesis; Sympodial growth; Xylem evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350169744

We test whether dominance can evolve in the sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) system in plants. SSI prevents mating between individuals expressing identical SI phenotypes by recognition of pollen by pistils, which avoids selfing and inbreeding depression. SI phenotypes depend on a complex network of dominance relationships between alleles at the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus). Empirical studies suggest that these relationships are not random, but the exact evolutionary processes shaping these relationships remain unclear. We investigate the expected patterns of dominance under the hypothesis that dominance is a direct target of natural selection. We follow the fate of a mutant allele at the S-locus whose dominance relationships are changed but whose specificity remains unaltered. We show that strict codominance is not evolutionarily stable in SSI, and that inbreeding depression due to deleterious mutations linked or unlinked to the S-locus exerts strong constraints on changes in relative levels of dominance in pollen and pistil. Our results provide a general adaptive explanation for most patterns of dominance relationships empirically observed in natural plant populations. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Balancing selection; Frequency-dependent selection; Gene expression; Inbreeding depression; Multiallelic systems; S-locus; Sheltered load,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149097415

Even though organs of induced polyploids are often larger than the wild type, whole plants are often shorter in stature. Three studies were conducted to induce polyploidy and to evaluate the growth and reproductive potential of the resulting polyploids. In study 1, seeds were soaked for 24 hours in aqueous solutions of 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 0.5% colchicine (w/v) plus 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide. In studies 2 and 3, apical meristems of seedlings at the cotyledon stage were treated for 1 or 3 days with 0, 50, 100, or 150 mM oryzalin solidified with 0.8% agar. Visual observations and measurement of guard cells were used to identify plants that potentially had their chromosome number doubled. Flow cytometry of nuclei stained with DAPI was used for confirmation of polyploidy. No induced polyploidy was observed following seed treatment with colchicine at the rates and duration used in this study. One-time application of 50 mM oryzalin resulted in a single mixoploid (4x + 8x) in which the ploidy of the L-I, L-II, and L-III histogenic layers were identified as a 4-4-4 + 8, respectively. Three-day applications with 100 and 150 mM oryzalin resulted in an octoploid (8x) and a mixoploid (4x + 8x), respectively. The mixoploid from the 3-day treatment stabilized at the 8x level before flowering, but was identified as a 4 + 8-x-4 cytochimera. Plant height was reduced, leaves were smaller, internodes were shorter, and canopy volume was reduced in the octoploid (8x) form compared with the tetraploid (4x) form. Furthermore, in contrast to the tetraploid, the octoploid produced no self-pollinated seed and performed poorly as a staminate and pistillate parent in controlled crosses.

It can escape from cultivation through seed dispersal and can contaminate native lantana species (Lantana depressa) through cross-pollination. Ploidy manipulation is being used as a genetic approach to produce sterile, noninvasive lantana cultivars. Polyploids have been observed in lantana (Lantana), but little information is available about the mechanisms for lantana polyploidization and the possible effects of natural polyploidization on the sterility (or fertility) of lantana triploids. In this study, we analyzed the ploidy level of more than 1500 lantana progeny from self, open, and/or controlled pollinations of 10 commercial cultivars and seven breeding lines. Our results confirmed the occurrence of unreduced gametes, specifically, unreduced female gametes (UFGs), in lantana. The frequency of UFG formation varied among commercial cultivars, and cultivars/breeding lines could be categorized into two groups: UFG producers and nonproducers. Tetraploid cultivars Gold, Pink Caprice, and Radiation fall into the UFG- producing group, while diploid cultivars Cream, Denholm White and Lola and tetraploid cultivars Carlos, Dallas Red and Irene belong to the nonproducer group. The frequency of UFG formation observed in nine UFG producers was 5.5% to 100%, varying with cultivar, growing condition, and/or pollination scheme. Progeny of the cross between 'Carlos' (seed parent) and 'Gold' (pollen parent) also showed the ability to produce UFGs, indicating that the trait (UFG formation) could be transmitted from 'Gold' to its progeny and is likely to be controlled by nuclear gene(s). Lantana triploids with or without the UFG-forming ability in its genetic background showed a significant difference in seed set: the former produced abundant seed when pollinated, while the latter produced little or no seed. The results stress the need to avoid using lantana with UFG-forming ability as parents in crosses designed to produce sterile triploids for invasiveness control. Additionally, the results from this study suggest multiple pathways for emergence and evolution of polyploids in cultivated and naturalized lantana populations.",2n gametes; Invasiveness control; Ploidy analysis; Ploidy manipulation; Polyploid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450186563

Greuter & Burdet that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Coincya monensis is represented in the British flora by two subspecies; ssp. monensis is a diploid, endemic taxon largely confined to open, coastal, sand dune habitats along the west coast of Britain; ssp. cheiranthos is a tetraploid neophyte (alien) of ruderal and coastal habitats. Both subspecies occur as short-lived perennials in outbreeding, insect-pollinated populations in open, early successional communities. Individuals may perennate as hemicryptophytes with buds in basal rosettes or as chamaephytes with buds in aerial shoot rosettes, but adequate seed production is essential for the long-term maintenance of populations. Seed production by the much larger and more floriferous tetraploid alien populations is much greater than that of the native endemic populations. Neither subspecies is able to compete effectively in late successional, grassland communities. Coincya monensis ssp. monensis benefits from moderate disturbance by trampling, which helps to maintain open, sandy, semi-fixed dune communities, such as those dominated by Marram Grass (Ammophila arenaria). Coincya monensis ssp. monensis has been designated a scarce plant in the British flora and is a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The main threats to its conservation are loss of habitat through natural successional processes and urban development. Coincya monensis ssp. cheiranthos is well-established in South Wales where it appears to be undergoing a range expansion. At present there are no known mixed populations of the two subspecies but this remains a possibility if the alien subspecies continues to expand its range. Competition and hybridisation between subspecies in mixed populations will present additional problems in the conservation of endemic biodiversity in the British Flora. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Alien species; Climatic limitation; Communities; Conservation; Ecophysiology; Geographical and altitudinal distribution; Germination; Herbivory; Mycorrhiza; Parasites and diseases; Reproductive biology; Soils,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849105146

They hybridize occasionally, but the complete replacement of Q. suber chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) by that of Q. ilex was identified in two specific geographical areas. The objective of this study was to determine whether the contrasting situation reflected current or recent geographical interspecies gene flow variation or was the result of ancient introgression. Methods cpDNA PCR-RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) and variation at ten nuclear microsatellite loci were analysed in populations of each species, in 16 morphologically intermediate individuals and the progeny of several of them. Interspecies nuclear introgression was based on individual admixture rates using a Bayesian approach with no a priori species assignment, and on a maximum-likelihood (ML) method, using allele frequencies in the allopatric populations of each species as controls. Gene flow was compared specifically between populations located within and outside the specific areas. Key Results High interspecies nuclear genetic differentiation was observed, with twice the number of alleles in Q. ilex than in Q. suber. According to Bayesian assignment, approx. 1 of individuals had a high probability of being F1 hybrids, and bidirectional nuclear introgression affected approx. 4 of individuals in each species. Hybrid and introgressed individuals were identified predominantly in mixed stands and may have a recent origin. Higher proportions including allospecific genes recovered from past hybridization were obtained using the ML method. Similar rates of hybridization and of nuclear introgression, partially independent of cpDNA interspecies transfer suggestive of gene filtering, were obtained in the populations located within and outside the areas of complete cpDNA replacement. Conclusions The results did not provide evidence for geographical variation in interspecies gene flow. In contrast, historical introgression is supported by palynological records and constitutes the more reliable origin of cpDNA replacement in specific regions.",CpDNA PCR-RFLPs; Hybridization; Interspecies genetic introgression; Nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) variation; Quercus ilex; Quercus suber,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249215255

Enforced selfing experiments were conducted in 2 years. In the first year, self-pollination was applied at two flower ages to investigate the occurrence of delayed SC. I found that SC was not uncommon across all populations, but self-compatible plants usually produced few seeds. There was no evidence for delayed SC. The occurrence of SC was not associated with population-level ID, but populations with more limited availability of compatible mates had a significantly higher frequency of plants that were at least partially self-compatible.

We test the hypothesis that bumblebee foragers can rapidly learn prior information from past experience in two very different experimental environments. In the high-variance environment (patches of low and high quality), stochastic optimality models predicted that finding rewards should sometimes sharply increase an optimal forager's tendency to stay in a patch (an incremental response), whereas in the uniform environment, finding rewards should always decrease the tendency to stay (a decremental response). We use Cox regression models to show that, in a matter of hours, bees learned to match both predicted responses, resulting in a reward intake rate that averaged 80% of the predicted maximum. Following training in. either environment, bees' adaptive behavior carried over to a common test environment, thus confirming the influence of memorized prior information. Although Bayesian foraging by learning is often presumed, this study is the first to clearly isolate the adaptive use of a learned prior expectation. More generally, it highlights the remarkable adaptive plasticity of an important generalist pollinator and agent of selection. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Bayesian updating; Learning; Marginal value theorem; Optimal foraging; Patch-use model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70149120324

We also estimated the market value of Croatian beekeeping as a whole for the year 2007. The most marketable bee product is honey, but its value is many times smaller than the value of pollination that bees deliver to our ecosystem. Besides that, there is also the positive influence of the beekeeping activities on human health since they are bound to dwelling in the natural surroundings. The largest honey producers of the world, for the period 2002-2007 were, in descending order: China, Argentina, Turkey, the USA and Ukraine. The largest world honey exporters in the same period were Argentina, China, Mexico, Germany and Hungary, and largest importers were the USA, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and France. Germany is not only a large importer but also a large honey exporter. A trend analysis of the number of beehives in Croatia from 1967-2007 (variable x2) shows with 95% certainty that in the year 2015 the number of beehives in Croatia will be somewhere between 64.80 and 151.20 thousand. The predicted value for the same year for honey production (variable x3) is somewhere between 1,640 and 2,360 tons, and for per hive honey production (variable x4) between 16.34 and 20.87 kg.

Most of these deceptive orchids imitate the scent of rewarding flowers or potential mates [2, 3]. In this study, we investigated the floral scent involved in pollinator attraction to the rewardless orchid Dendrobium sinense, a species endemic to the Chinese island Hainan that is pollinated by the hornet Vespa bicolor. Via chemical analyses and electrophysiological methods, we demonstrate that the flowers of D. sinense produce (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol and that the pollinator can smell this compound. This is a major compound in the alarm pheromones of both Asian (Apis cerana) and European (Apis mellifera) honey bees [4, 5] and is also exploited by the European beewolf (Philanthus triangulum) to locate its prey [6]. This is the first time that (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol has been identified as a floral volatile. In behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that the floral scent of D. sinense and synthetic (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol are both attractive to hornets. Because hornets frequently capture honey bees to feed to their larvae, we suggest that the flowers of D. sinense mimic the alarm pheromone of honey bees in order to attract prey-hunting hornets for pollination. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the sexually deceptive species, baiting for pollinators has shown that within populations orchid species are typically pollinated by a single species of thynnine wasp. However, some wasp species can be pollinators of more than one species of orchid usually when their ranges do not overlap. There is a trend for closely related orchids to exploit wasps from the same genus, with different lineages of orchids often pollinated by different genera. Very little is known about pollination of food-deceptive Caladenia species, although it is evident they attract a suite of generalist food-seeking insects. Food-deceptive species have a higher pollination rate than do sexually deceptive species. Studies of population genetics and pollen movements are few, although they suggest a pattern of fine-scale genetic structuring within populations, owing to predominantly restricted seed dispersal and low genetic differentiation among populations as a consequence of rare long-distance seed-dispersal events.

The present study employed a multidisciplinary approach to better evaluate the pollination syndrome of the white spider orchid, Caladenia rigida R.S.Rogers, a species previously reported to utilise both food and sexual deception. This included the observation and capture of potential pollinators of C. rigida through direct observation, pantraps, Malaise traps and pollinator-baiting experiments, and the use of molecular techniques to identify orchid pollinia isolated from carrier insects.

(Orchidaceae) (syn. Arachnorchis behrii) is a sexually deceptive, endangered orchid that produces aggregated pollen as pollinia. It is pollinated by a thynnine wasp, and may also be pollinated incidentally by other insects. Pollinator effectiveness may depend on the number of pollinia that pollinators carry and deposit, and on whether they mediate cross-pollination or self-pollination. To understand the role of pollinators and guide conservation programs, we determined the effect of pollen load (one pollinium v. two pollinia) and self-pollination on seed number, seed (embryo) size and germination at 35 days. We also examined the effect of plant size on seed size and seed number. By using partial correlations with leaf width, seed size, seed number, capsule volume and stem length, we found that leaf width was a good predictor for seed number, and that seed size was not correlated with any of the variables examined. Flowers pollinated with one pollinium and two pollinia did not produce seeds that differed in size or number. Cross-pollinated flowers produced fewer but larger seeds, which germinated faster than did seeds from self-pollinated flowers. We conclude that seed production in the field may be estimated from leaf size, that pollinators carrying one pollinium are as effective as those carrying two pollinia and that selfing affects germination negatively, partly because of the smaller size of selfed seeds. Conservation programs aiming to perform hand-pollination of this species should use crossing with a single pollinium. © CSIRO 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949163966

Kangaroos and rabbits are the most commonly implicated herbivores; however, no studies have attempted to confirm their role. Regular monitoring of several populations of Caladenia rigida R.S.Rogers and C. tentaculata Schldl. during 3 years in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia, revealed that up to 94% of flowers and 36% of seed capsules were browsed, whereas leaf herbivory was less prevalent. Furthermore, patterns of herbivory varied markedly among sites and across years. In two seasons, predation of C. rigida flowers inside a kangaroo- and rabbit-proof exclosure was equal to or higher than outside the exclosure. Florivory within populations was influenced by proximity to the habitat edge, although the direction of this response differed among sites. Various types of mesh cages were erected around plants to elucidate the size and type of herbivores. Plants protected from florivores were almost three times more likely to produce seed than were exposed plants; however, some cage types reduced pollination. Video surveillance confirmed the role of the white-winged chough, Corcorax melanorhamphos, as a florivore. The present study is the first one to identify a herbivore unequivocally, quantify the intensity and extent of floral herbivory across a range of populations, and assess the potential cost of florivory to the direct reproductive output of orchids. © CSIRO 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949147938

Despite their closely taxonomic affinity and their evolution under insular conditions, different trends were recorded. Mature J. cedrus female cones were present throughout the year, while those from J. brevifolia were only present in summer and autumn. J. cedrus female cone size was significantly larger than that of J. brevifolia, a trend consistent with the presence of larger vertebrates (lizards and birds) in the Canary Islands. However, water content was four times higher in J. brevifolia female cones, which can be related with the higher rainfall existing in the Azores. J. cedrus has two or three seeds per cone, whereas J. brevifolia frequently had three. Seeds from J. cedrus were clearly larger and heavier, coinciding with the female cone size trend. However, tetrazolium tests revealed higher viability values in J. brevifolia. The relatively low percentage of filled seeds in J. cedrus could be a consequence of the climatic stress and limits to pollination due to fragmented populations as described for other Juniperus species. In summary, our results reveal that some environmental factors such as the harsh conditions, high population fragmentation and the dependence on large dispersers have compromised the fitness of J. cedrus in the Canary Islands. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Female cones; Island plants; Juniperus brevifolia; Juniperus cedrus; Plant conservation; Seasonality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749134241

The largest known populations are confined to fire-managed coastal heathland in southern Victoria. Trends in population dynamics at two closely occurring sites were evaluated against time since fire and rainfall, between 2000 and 2008, to provide ecological and biological information relevant to population management. At both sites, decreased plant size was inversely correlated with time since fire and the number of non-reproductive plants was positively correlated with time since fire. Rates of flowering were inversely correlated with time since fire at only one site (Population 2). The vegetation at this site rapidly accumulated after fire, whereas recovery was relatively slow at the other site. Rainfall was not correlated with rates of flowering or leaf width at either of the study sites, although there was a weak inverse relationship between rainfall and the number of non-reproductive plants at one site (Population 1). Rates of pollen transport and fruit set were within reported ranges for deceptive species. Fruiting plants were significantly smaller in the following year, whereas non-reproductive plants remained the same size. The results suggest that there may be costs associated with reproductive effort, and that hand-pollinating plants to boost seed production may lead to decreased plant size in the following year. Annual variation in rates of flowering may be influenced by previous reproductive effort. However, long-term population trends are better explained by competition from dominant shrubs, which become increasingly abundant with a lack of fire. Future management prescriptions should include site-specific fire regimes to maintain an open heathland. © CSIRO 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949164940

Many flowering plants attract pollinators by offering a reward of floral nectar. Remarkably, the molecular events involved in the development of nectaries, the organs that produce nectar, as well as the synthesis and secretion of nectar itself, are poorly understood. Indeed, to date, no genes have been shown to directly affect the de novo production or quality of floral nectar. To address this gap in knowledge, the ATH1 Affymetrix® GeneChip array was used to systematically investigate the Arabidopsis nectary transcriptome to identify genes and pathways potentially involved in nectar production. Results. In this study, we identified a large number of genes differentially expressed between secretory lateral nectaries and non-secretory median nectary tissues, as well as between mature lateral nectaries (post-anthesis) and immature lateral nectaries (pre-anthesis). Expression within nectaries was also compared to thirteen non-nectary reference tissues, from which 270 genes were identified as being significantly upregulated in nectaries. The expression patterns of 14 nectary-enriched genes were also confirmed via RT PCR. Upon looking into functional groups of upregulated genes, pathways involved in gene regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism were particularly enriched in nectaries versus reference tissues. Conclusion. A large number of genes preferentially expressed in nectaries, as well as between nectary types and developmental stages, were identified. Several hypotheses relating to mechanisms of nectar production and regulation thereof are proposed, and provide a starting point for reverse genetics approaches to determine molecular mechanisms underlying nectar synthesis and secretion.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949086927

In animal-pollinated species, pollination services, and thus fruit and seed set, may be highly variable among years and sites, and depend on both local environmental conditions and climatic variables. Orchid species may be particularly vulnerable to disruption of their pollination services, as most species depend on pollinators for successful fruit set and because seed germination and seedling recruitment are to some extent dependent on the amount of fruits and seeds produced. Better insights into the factors determining fruit and seed set are therefore indispensable for a better understanding of population dynamics and viability of orchid populations under changing climatic conditions. However, very few studies have investigated spatio-temporal variation in fruit set in orchids. Here, we quantified fruit production in eight populations of the orchid Orchis purpurea that does not reward pollinators and 13 populations of the rewarding Neottia (Listera) ovata during five consecutive years (2002-2006). Fruit production in large populations showed much higher stability than that in small populations and was less affected by extreme weather conditions. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of small orchid populations to an increasingly variable climate through highly unpredictable fruit-set patterns. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Environmental stochasticity; Female reproductive success; Orchids; Pollination; Temporal variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67749093155

It is suggested that the type of interaction, trophic versus mutualistic, should affect species generalization level; however, no direct comparison has been made yet. Here, we performed such a comparison using 44 plant-insect networks describing either pollination or herbivory communities. Our analysis shows that the type of interaction does indeed have an impact on various aspects of species generalism, from the distribution of generalism in the community to the phylogenetic diversity of the plants with which a given insect species interacts. However, the amplitude of the observed differences depends on the aspect of species generalism studied. While the non-quantitative and quantitative measures of generalism suggest that pollinators interact with more plant species and more evenly than herbivores, phylogenetic measures clearly show that herbivores interact with plant species far more closely related to each other than pollinators. This comparative approach offers a promising perspective to better understand the functioning and evolution of multispecies assemblages by pointing out some fundamental singularities of communities depending on the type of interaction considered. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Generalism; Herbivory; Interaction web; Mutualistic; Pollination; Trophic,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68249096990

Only recently has it been appreciated that diversification might have proceeded quite differently for the two key diagnostic structures of this clade, flowers and fruits. These structures are hypothesized to have experienced different selective pressures via their interactions with animals in dispersal mutualisms, resulting in a greater amount of morphological diversification in animal-pollinated flowers than in animal-dispersed fruits. I tested this idea using size and colour traits for the flowers and fruits of 472 species occurring in three floras (St John, Hawaii and the Great Plains). Phylogenetically controlled analyses of nearest-neighbour distances in multidimensional trait space matched the predicted pattern: in each of the three floras, flowers were more divergent from one another than were fruits. In addition, the spacing of species clusters differed for flowers versus fruits in the flora of St John, with clusters in flower space more divergent than those in fruit space. The results are consistent with the idea that a major driver of angiosperm diversification has been stronger selection for divergent floral morphology than for divergent fruit morphology, although genetic, physiological and ecological constraints may also play a role. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Angiosperm radiation; Ecological sorting; Floral character displacement; Frugivory; Pollinator constancy; Seed dispersal and pollination syndromes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68249127598

For anemophilous (wind-pollinated) species, such as grasses and many trees, shedding pollen from the anther must be accomplished by physical mechanisms. The unknown nature of this process has led to its description as the 'paradox of pollen liberation'. A simple scaling analysis, supported by experimental measurements on typical wind-pollinated plant species, is used to estimate the suitability of previous resolutions of this paradox based on wind-gust aerodynamic models of fungal-spore liberation. According to this scaling analysis, the steady Stokes drag force is found to be large enough to liberate anemophilous pollen grains, and unsteady boundary-layer forces produced by wind gusts are found to be mostly ineffective since the ratio of the characteristic viscous time scale to the inertial time scale of acceleration of the wind stream is a small parameter for typical anemophilous species.

The usefulness of this technique for detailed expression profiling in a non-model organism was demonstrated for the highly complex, neither fully sequenced nor annotated genome of B. napus by applying a tag-to-gene matching strategy based on Brassica ESTs and the annotated proteome of the closely related model crucifer A. thaliana. RESULTS: Transcripts from 3,094 genes were detected at two time-points of seed development, 23 days and 35 days after pollination (DAP). Differential expression showed a shift from gene expression involved in diverse developmental processes including cell proliferation and seed coat formation at 23 DAP to more focussed metabolic processes including storage protein accumulation and lipid deposition at 35 DAP. The most abundant transcripts at 23 DAP were coding for diverse protease inhibitor proteins and proteases, including cysteine proteases involved in seed coat formation and a number of lipid transfer proteins involved in embryo pattern formation. At 35 DAP, transcripts encoding napin, cruciferin and oleosin storage proteins were most abundant. Over both time-points, 18.6% of the detected genes were matched by Brassica ESTs identified by LongSAGE tags in antisense orientation. This suggests a strong involvement of antisense transcript expression in regulatory processes during B. napus seed development. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the potential of transcript tagging approaches for gene expression profiling in Brassica crop species via EST matching to annotated A. thaliana genes. Limits of tag detection for low-abundance transcripts can today be overcome by ultra-high throughput sequencing approaches, so that tag-based gene expression profiling may soon become the method of choice for global expression profiling in non-model species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849126961

In this paper we focus on short distance dispersal (SDD) of pollen in a low-density stand of a savannah oak, Quercus lobata Née. Specifically, we are interested in the proportional contributions of pollen donors, the pollen dispersal kernel that describes local matings, the extent to which wind influences mating success, and the extent to which pollen sources vary within the large canopy of these trees. Using maximum likelihood paternity analysis, we assigned sires for 474 outcrossed progeny of five seed trees, representing 120 of 160 potential mating pairs within a 250 m radius of each focal tree (ca. 20 ha plots). We first established that the effective number of pollen donors for progeny with sires within the plot was about 10 individuals, with average weighted pollination distances of 114.1 m. We estimated 18.5% pollen immigration into the 20 ha plots. We next established that the SDD portion of the dispersal kernel is best described by the exponential power, inverse power, and Weibull functions, all that capture high local dispersal with steep decay. Two of these models suggest that long distance dispersal is abundant, represented by a fat tail, while the Weibull indicates depauperate long distance dispersal, represented by a thin tail. The addition of a directional component corresponding to the predominant wind axis had no meaningful impact on these models. Finally, we established that different parts of an individual tree canopy of Q. lobata sample from the same homogeneous pollen pool showing no bias towards pollen sources near that part of the canopy. Overall findings suggest low-density Q. lobata populations show steep decay of SDD. Policies and ordinances governing the amount of allowable tree removal of savannah oak populations should recommend the preservation of local clusters of adults, as well as some connectivity among clusters. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Species richness and abundance of bees and wasps can be hypothesised to increase with plant diversity, structural complexity, and availability of food and nesting resources. By experimentally exposing standardised nesting sites, we examined abundance and species richness of cavity-nesting bees (pollinators), wasps (predators) and their associated parasitoids across a tree diversity gradient in a temperate deciduous forest habitat. In addition, spatial distribution of individuals and species across forest strata (canopy vs. understory) was tested. Abundance and species richness was high for predatory wasps, but generally low for pollinators. Species-rich forest stands supported increased abundance, but not species richness, of pollinators and predatory wasps, and also increased abundance and species richness of natural enemies. In addition, the forests showed a distinct spatial stratification in that abundance of bees, wasps and parasitoids as well as parasitism rates were higher in the canopy than understory. We conclude that particularly the canopy in temperate forest stands can serve as an important habitat for predatory wasp species and natural enemies, but not bee pollinators. Enhanced tree diversity was related to increased hymenopteran abundance, which is likely to be linked to an increase in nesting and food resources in mixed forest stands. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is rapidly emerging as a powerful model system to facilitate research aimed at improving grass crops for grain, forage and energy production. To characterize the natural diversity of Brachypodium and provide a valuable new tool to the growing list of resources available to Brachypodium researchers, we created and characterized a large, diverse collection of inbred lines. Results. We developed 84 inbred lines from eight locations in Turkey. To enable genotypic characterization of this collection, we created 398 SSR markers from BAC end and EST sequences. An analysis of 187 diploid lines from 56 locations with 43 SSR markers showed considerable genotypic diversity. There was some correlation between SSR genotypes and broad geographic regions, but there was also a high level of genotypic diversity at individual locations. Phenotypic analysis of this new germplasm resource revealed considerable variation in flowering time, seed size, and plant architecture. The inbreeding nature of Brachypodium was confirmed by an extremely high level of homozygosity in wild plants and a lack of cross-pollination under laboratory conditions. Conclusion. Taken together, the inbreeding nature and genotypic diversity observed at individual locations suggest a significant amount of long-distance seed dispersal. The resources developed in this study are freely available to the research community and will facilitate experimental applications based on natural diversity. © 2009 Vogel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68749109670

We compared differences in the rates of foraged flowers, pollen weights foraged from anthers, rates of fruit set of tomatoes, seed number of tomato fruits and yields of tomato fruit weight between M. quadrifasciata and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. When the amount of tomato pollen was sufficient, there were no differences in pollination efficiency between the stingless bee and the bumblebee; however, the rates of foraged flowers, the rate of fruit set and the yields were significantly reduced in the stingless bee compared with the bumblebee when fertile tomato pollen decreased markedly during the hottest period of the summer. During this period, the rate of flowers foraged by bumblebees did not decrease, but the rates of fruit set, the seed number and the yields of tomato fruits decreased significantly in comparison with the other periods. It is known that tomato pollen production is inhibited at high temperatures; thus, we consider that the high temperatures in the greenhouse (average daily temperature higher than 28°C) caused the extreme decrease in pollen production.

So the species with a suit of advantageous characteristics inherent in its reproductive ecology is critical to its dispersion. Spartina alterniflora - a perennial grass native to coastal marshes of America was introduced to China in 1979 and now it is distributed in the Tianjin coastal wetlands of northern China. Flowering phenology was examined and indicated that in northern localities, flowering initiated in mid-August and senescence occurred by the end of October. The pollen-ovule ratio was 9875 (±2150). Abundant pollen grains compensated for a lack of pollen viability. Pollen viability was 10% approximately when pollen released 4 hours, but stigma receptivity was above 10% when stigmas exserted 7 hours. Stigmas maintained viability longer than the period of pollen release, ensuring successful pollination. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe stigma surface characters and pollen viability. Further investigation proved stigma adaptations to increase pollen capture and exterior pollen tube growth following pollination was beneficial to fertilization. The results suggested that flowering phenology and pollination traits are vital to pollination and production of viable seed, enabling the species to spread rapidly and succeed in new habitats of northern China.",Adaptation; Florescence; Introduced species; Pollination; Sexual reproduction; Spartina alterniflora,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68249133928

Fruits of pollination-constant and non-astringent (PCNA) type mutants lose their ability to produce PA at an early stage of fruit development, while fruits of the normal (non-PCNA) type remain rich in PA until fully ripened. To understand the molecular mechanism for this difference, we isolated the genes involved in PA accumulation that are differentially expressed between PCNA and non-PCNA, and confirmed their correlation with PA content and composition. The expression of structural genes of the shikimate and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways and genes encoding transferases homologous to those involved in the accumulation of phenolic compounds were downregulated coincidentally only in the PCNA type. Analysis of PA composition using the phloroglucinol method suggested that the amounts of epigallocatechin and its 3-O-gallate form were remarkably low in the PCNA type. In the PCNA type, the genes encoding flavonoid 3?5? hydroxylase (F3?5?H) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) for epigallocatechin biosynthesis showed remarkable downregulation, despite the continuous expression level of their competitive genes, flavonoid 3? hydroxylation (F3?H) and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR). We also confirmed that the relative expression levels of F3?5?H to F3?H, and ANR to LAR, were considerably higher, and the PA composition corresponded to the seasonal expression balances in both types. These results suggest that expressions of F3?5?H and ANR are important for PA accumulation in persimmon fruit. Lastly, we tested enzymatic activity of recombinant DkANR in vitro, which is thought to be an important enzyme for PA accumulation in persimmon fruits. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Diospyros; Flavonoid; Polymerisation; Proanthocyanidin; Shikimate pathway,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73949088425

The analysis is based upon experiments with arable farmers in Germany who were asked to choose among conventional and GM rapeseed varieties with different characteristics. Our analysis has shown that ex ante GM adoption decisions are driven by profit expectations and personal as well as farm characteristics. Monetary and technological determinants such as the gross margin advantage of GM oilseed rape varieties, expected liability from cross pollination and restricted flexibility in returning to conventional oilseed rape growing affect the willingness to adopt GM rape in the expected directions. The results further indicate that neighbourhood effects and public attitudes matter a lot, such that individual farmers may not feel entirely free in their technology choice. Our demand simulations suggest that monopolistic seed prices would be set at between 50 and 100 per hectare, leaving farmers with a small share of the GM rent. This raises the question as to whether the farmers surveyed would actually benefit from the approval of GM rape varieties if the technology were to be provided by a single firm. © Journal compilation © 2009 The Agricultural Economics Society and The European Association of Agricultural Economists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149170411

This study identified the relative contribution of the maternal and paternal parent to reproductive success in E. globulus, and examined the genetic basis to the observed variation. Reproductive success was measured in terms of the number of viable seeds obtained per flower crossed. Data on the reproductive success of numerous genotypes from the Furneaux, Strzelecki Ranges and Otways races were obtained from: (i) 12 years of operational full-sib crossing; (ii) a designed fullsib diallel mating scheme; and (iii) capsule retention trials conducted over three seasons at two Tasmanian seed orchards on the same ramets of different genotypes. Analysis of the sparse operational data revealed that both male and female factors significantly affected reproductive success, accounting for 5.0% and 7.9% of the variation respectively. The more precise diallel crossing revealed that a large, and significant, proportion 55%, of the variation in reproductive success between crosses at a single site was explained by the female parent. The male parent explained only 6.7%, but this effect was not statistically significant and was related to variation in in vitro pollen germination. The significant female effect was found to be consistent at the genotype level across seasons, sites and pollination techniques suggesting a genetic basis to the variation.

Box 653, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel","Agricultural operations at great heights are typically laborious, expensive, and dangerous for human workers. Spraying and pollinating date palm trees, for instance, is currently done manually by a team of several workers from a platform lifted 18 m or more above the ground. This method is extremely unsafe, and many accidents have occurred due to instability when the platform is in a lifted position. In this paper we present the concept of an autonomous field robot that will effectively and accurately spray and pollinate date clusters. A scaled-down prototype has been designed and consists of a visually controlled robotic arm that guides the jet of a mounted sprayer directly to the date clusters completely autonomously and from a short distance. Rather than requiring an expensive dedicated platform, this robotic apparatus can be towed by a standard tractor operated by a single driver, with no human worker operating in the heights. This system can minimize risk of injury, significantly save manpower, and deliver the spray with maximum accuracy, thereby reducing chemical disposal. The spraying guidance system is based on a proportional controller that uses feedback from an image processing system combined with a small dead band. The system was modeled mathematically, and the effect of each component on overall performance was evaluated by simulation. Results were used for tuning the experimental system controller parameters. Experiments were performed to evaluate the tracking performance of the visually guided tracking system on a single tree and a 10-m-long runway at a distance of 6 m. These dimensions were inspired by the conditions at a typical orchard. During the experiment the sprayer was towed along the runway 19 times, during which the speed of the wagon was varied between 0.7 km/h (0.2 m/s) and 12 km/h (3.3 m/s). Experimental results indicate that up to a wagon ve1ocity of 1.25 m/s the tracking error was reasonably low and stayed below 10 deg from the center of the target (typical date spraying speed is 1.1 m/s). However, at higher speeds the tracking quality reduced progressively and some drift (i.e., accumulated error) was noticed in the pan axis due to image processing speed. The simulations and experiments with a scaled-down prototype show feasibility of the presented method and demonstrate how this new approach facilitates more efficient high-altitude agricultural robotics. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68049084469

Self-incompatible species of the Brassicaceae block pollen hydration, and while the early signaling steps of the self-incompatibility response are well studied, the precise mechanisms controlling pollen hydration are poorly understood. Both lipids and proteins are important for hydration; loss of pollen coat lipids and proteins results in defective or delayed hydration on the stigma surface. Here, we examine the role of the pollen coat protein extracellular lipase 4 (EXL4), in the initial steps of pollination, namely hydration on the stigma. We identify a mutant allele, exl4-1, that shows a reduced rate of pollen hydration. exl4-1 pollen is normal with respect to pollen morphology and the downstream steps in pollination, including pollen tube germination, growth, and fertilization of ovules. However, owing to the delay in hydration, exl4-1 pollen is at a disadvantage when competed with wild-type pollen. EXL4 also functions in combination with GRP17 to promote the initiation of hydration. EXL4 is similar to GDSL lipases, and we show that it functions in hydrolyzing ester bonds. We report a previously unknown function for EXL4, an abundant pollen coat protein, in promoting pollen hydration on the stigma. Our results indicate that changes in lipid composition at the pollen-stigma interface, possibly mediated by EXLs, are required for efficient pollination in species with dry stigmas. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",EXL4; Extracellular lipase; GRP17; Hydration; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349859623

Tomato fruit set is a key process that has a great economic impact on crop production. We employed the Affymetrix GeneChip Tomato Genome Array to compare the transcriptome of a non-parthenocarpic line, UC82, with that of the parthenocarpic line RP75/59 (pat3/pat4 mutant). We analyzed the transcriptome under normal conditions as well as with forced parthenocarpic development in RP75/59, emasculating the flowers 2 days before anthesis. This analysis helps to understand the fruit set in tomato. Results. Differentially expressed genes were extracted with maSigPro, which is designed for the analysis of single and multiseries time course microarray experiments. 2842 genes showed changes throughout normal carpel development and fruit set. Most of them showed a change of expression at or after anthesis. The main differences between lines were concentrated at the anthesis stage. We found 758 genes differentially expressed in parthenocarpic fruit set. Among these genes we detected cell cycle-related genes that were still activated at anthesis in the parthenocarpic line, which shows the lack of arrest in the parthenocarpic line at anthesis. Key genes for the synthesis of gibberellins and ethylene, which were up-regulated in the parthenocarpic line were also detected. Conclusion. Comparisons between array experiments determined that anthesis was the most different stage and the key point at which most of the genes were modulated. In the parthenocarpic line, anthesis seemed to be a short transitional stage to fruit set. In this line, the high GAs contends leads to the development of a parthenocarpic fruit, and ethylene may mimic pollination signals, inducing auxin synthesis in the ovary and the development of a jelly fruit. © 2009 Pascual et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650150190

By promoting foraging constancy in pollinators, floral rewards such as nectar may enhance the overall efficiency of pollen transfer. However, this can also lead to high levels of geitonogamy. Pollen fates were studied in Acrolophia cochlearis, a member of a terrestrial epidendroid orchid genus that includes both rewarding and deceptive species.MethodsPollinator observations were conducted. Pollen transfer efficiency (PTE), the proportion of removed pollinia deposited on stigmas, was measured in a large population at regular intervals throughout the 5-month flowering season. The level of cross-pollination in two populations was estimated from the percentage of seeds with embryos in naturally pollinated fruits.Key ResultsAcrolophia cochlearis (and a congener A. micrantha) produce minute but concentrated nectar rewards. Observations showed that A. cochlearis is pollinated exclusively by a solitary bee species, Colletes claripes. Although both sexes visited flowers, only males carried pollinaria. Overall levels of pollination and PTE of the rewarding A. cochlearis were much higher than in a deceptive congener, A. capensis. Seeds resulting from self-fertilization had a significantly lower probability of containing viable embryos than did those from cross-fertilization. This dichotomy in fruit quality was used to estimate that cross-pollination occurred in approx. 66 of A. cochlearis flowers in a large dense population and approx. 10 in a small sparse population. Traits of A. cochlearis that limit geitonogamy include pollinarium reconfiguration that exceeds the visit time of pollinators and rapid flower senescence following visitation.ConclusionsPresence of a nectar reward in Acrolophia cochlearis results in high levels of PTE. It is estimated that approx. 33-90 of fruits in natural populations arise from self-pollination in this species.",Acrolophia cochlearis; Cape floral region; Deception; Epidendroid orchid; Geitonogamy; Pollen tracking; Pollen transfer efficiency; Reward,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849087111

Antagonistic interactions and defenses or counter-defenses are expected particularly in nursery pollination. In these systems, adult insects, while pollinating, lay their eggs in flowers, and juveniles consume the seeds from one or several fruits, thereby substantially reducing plant fitness. The outcome of such interactions will depend, for the plant, on the balance between pollination versus seed predation and for the larvae on the balance between the food and shelter provided versus the costs imposed by plant defenses, e.g., through abortion of infested fruits. Here, we examine the costs and benefits to the larvae in the nursery-pollination system Silene latifolia/Hadena bicruris. Using selection lines that varied in flower size (large- vs. small-flowered plants), we investigated the effects of variation in flower and fruit size and of a potential defense, fruit abortion, on larval performance. In this system, infested fruits are significantly more likely to be aborted than non-infested fruits; however, it is unclear whether fruit abortion is effective as a defense. Larger flowers gave rise to larger fruits with more seeds, and larvae that were heavier at emergence. Fruit abortion was frequently observed (ca. 40% of the infested fruits). From aborted fruits, larvae emerged earlier and were substantially lighter than larvae emerging from non-aborted fruits. The lower mass at emergence of larvae from aborted fruits indicates that abortion is a resistance mechanism. Assuming that lower larval mass implies fewer resources invested in the frugivore, these results also suggest that abortion is likely to benefit the plant as a defense mechanism, by limiting both resources invested in attacked fruits, as well as the risk of secondary attack. This suggests that selective fruit abortion may contribute to the stability of mutualism also in this non-obligate system. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Flower number; Nursery pollination; Pollination mutualism; Pre-dispersal seed predation; Silene alba,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649359709

Cross-pollination was revealed by the presence of yellow-grains on a white-grain hybrid at distances up to 17.5 m from the yellow-grain pollen donor hybrid. The measurements of the inclination of the slope were based on aerial images data taken by an unmanned GPS/INS (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System)-based and stabilized model helicopter, which delivered precise altitude-based data for sampling points at tassel height. The rate of cross-pollination increased significantly with decreasing altitude of the receptor field (r = 0.36-0.64).

In order to identify which species pollinate eight representative populations in mainland Sweden, we observed and sampled visitors to flowers using a standardized protocol. Specimens were identified and any pollen smear found on their body was examined for the presence of Cypripedium pollen.

Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species. These results suggest that pollination networks are to some extent robust against factors affecting species occurrences. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650843931

In autogamous selfers in which pollen receipt is highly reliable, selection should favor genotypes that maintain low and stable pollen to ovule (P : O) ratios throughout flowering. By contrast, in outcrossers the optimum P : O ratio of an individual's flowers will depend on pollinator abundances and mating opportunities, both of which may vary over time. In this case, selection may favor temporal variation among flowers in the P : O ratio. An opposing prediction is that selfing taxa will be developmentally more unstable than outcrossers because of lower homeostasis caused by high homozygosity.  We compared temporal changes in the P : O ratio in two pairs of sister taxa in the genus Clarkia. We examined hundreds of glasshouse-raised maternal families representing three wild populations each of the outcrossing, insect-pollinated Clarkia unguiculata, the facultatively autogamous Clarkia exilis and the outcrossing and selfing subspecies of Clarkia xantiana: ssp. xantiana and parviflora, respectively.  Temporal change in the P : O ratio was significantly greater in both outcrossers than in their selfing sister taxa, although the proportional changes in the P : O ratio (relative to the first bud produced) did not differ significantly between sister taxa (0.07 < P < 0.10).  Our results provide partial support for the hypothesis that the P : O ratio is more stable in selfing than in outcrossing taxa and reject the hypothesis that selfers are less stable. © New Phytologist (2009).",Autogamy; Developmental instability; Mating system; Ontogenetic variation; P : O ratio; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650938422

The ability to reproduce in new environments is essential for the successful establishment and spread of introduced species. Introduced plant species that are not capable of autonomous self-fertilization and are unable to attract resident pollinators may suffer from pollen limitation. Our study quantifies the degree of autogamy and pollination ecology of 10 closely related pairs of native and introduced plant species at a single site near St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Most of these species pairs had similar capacities for autogamy; however, of those that differed, the introduced species were more autogamous than their native congeners. Most introduced plants have pollinator visitation rates similar to those of their native congeners. Of the 20 species studied, only three had significant pollen limitation.

The main study site was Little Barrier Island, New Zealand where indigenous bird and native solitary bees are the main flower visitors. Our results showed that native birds were more important pollinators of M. excelsa than native bees. Seed production was much higher in open pollination than in two exclusion experiments where either birds were excluded and native bees only had access to flowers, or where all pollinators had been excluded. The number of fertile seeds per capsule was 45% higher after open pollination than in treatments with bee visitation only and 28% higher than in treatments where all flower visitors were excluded. Estimated outcrossing rates were significantly higher (tm = 0.71) for open pollination in the upper canopy (&gt;4 m above-ground level) where bird visitation is presumed to be more frequent than for a treatment with native bee access only (tm = 0.40). Our results also suggest that a large proportion of seeds (66%) arise from autonomous self-pollination when all pollinators are excluded. In four trees of a modified mainland population with predominantly introduced birds and a mixture of introduced and native bees there was no decrease in seed production for the treatment allowing bee access only, indicating that - in contrast to native bees - honeybees may be more efficient pollinators of M. excelsa. Observation of the foraging behaviour of both groups of bees showed that native bees contact the stigma of flowers less frequently than honeybees. This is likely to be a consequence of their smaller body size relative to honeybees. © 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",Outcrossing rate; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pohutukawa; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator-stigma contact; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349141240

In that condition, species are expected to be reproductively isolated through a pre-mating mechanical barrier. Here, the relative contribution of pre- vs. post-mating barriers to gene flow among two Ophrys species that share a common pollinator and can occur in sympatry is studied.MethodsA natural hybrid zone on Sardinia between O. iricolor and O. incubacea, sharing Andrena morio as pollinator, was investigated by analysing floral traits involved in pollinator attraction as odour extracts both for non-active and active compounds and for labellum morphology. The genetic architecture of the hybrid zone was also estimated with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, and pollination fitness and seed set of both parental species and their hybrids in the sympatric zone were estimated by controlled crosses.Key ResultsAlthough hybrids were intermediate between parental species in labellum morphology and non-active odour compounds, both parental species and hybrids produced a similar odour bouquet for active compounds. However, hybrids produced significantly lower fruit and seed set than parental species, and the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone suggests that they were mostly first-generation hybrids.ConclusionsThe two parental species hybridize in sympatry as a consequence of pollinator overlap and weak mechanical isolation, but post-zygotic barriers reduce hybrid frequency and fitness, and prevent extensive introgression. These results highlight a significant contribution of late post-mating barriers, such as chromosomal divergence, for maintaining reproductive isolation, in an orchid group for which pre-mating barriers are often considered predominant.",AFLP markers; Floral scent variation; Hybrid fitness; Hybrid zone; Ophrys incubacea; Ophrys iricolor; Reproductive isolation; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149110723

Nevertheless, up to now there have been few attempts to investigate the interplay between the structure of real pollination networks and their dynamics. This study is one of the first contributions to explore this issue. Biological invasions, of major concern for conservation, are also poorly understood from the perspective of complex ecological networks. In this paper we assess the role that established alien species play within a host community by analyzing the temporal changes in structural network properties driven by the removal of non-native plants. Three topological measures have been used to represent the most relevant structural properties for the stability of ecological networks: degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity. Therefore, we investigate for a detailed pollination network, 1) how its dynamics, represented as changes in species abundances, affect the evolution of its structure, 2) how topology relates to dynamics focusing on long-term species persistence; and 3) how both structure and dynamics are affected by the removal of alien plant species. Network dynamics were simulated by means of a stochastic metacommunity model. Our results showed that established alien plants are important for the persistence of the pollination network and for the maintenance of its structure. Removal of alien plants decreased the likelihood of species persistence. On the other hand, both the full network and the subset native network tended to lose their structure through time. Nevertheless, the structure of the full network was better preserved than the structure of the network without alien plants. Temporal topological shifts were evident in terms of degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity. However the effects of removing alien plants were more pronounced for degree distribution and modularity of the network. Therefore, elimination of alien plants affected the evolution of the architecture of the interaction web, which was closely related to the higher species loss found in the network where alien plants were removed. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649208476

Obligate pollination by a single wasp species is rare in Orchidaceae except in species with sexually deceptive flowers that are pollinated exclusively by male insects. The object of this study was to document pollination of the food-deceptive flowers of Coelogyne fimbriata, a species pollinated exclusively by female wasps.MethodsField observations and experiments were conducted in two populations of C. fimbriata. Floral phenology was recorded, and functional floral architecture was measured. Insect visitors to flowers were observed from 2005 to 2007. Bioassay experiments were conducted to check whether the floral odour attracted pollinators. Natural (insect-mediated) rates of pollinarium removal, pollinium deposition on stigmas, and fruit set were recorded. To determine the importance of cross-pollination, the breeding system was assessed via controlled, hand-pollination experiments.Key ResultsTwo populations of C. fimbriata with fragrant, nectarless flowers are pollinated by females of the same Vespula species (Vespidae, Hymenoptera). Experiments on wasps show that they crawl towards the source of the odour. The flowering period appears to coincide with an annual peak in Vespula colony expansion when additional workers forage for carbohydrates. Rates of pollinarium removal (0·069- 0·918) and pollinium deposition on stigmas (0·025-0·695) are extremely variable. However, fruit set in C. fimbriata is always low (0·014-0·069) and appears to be based on self-incompatibility coupled with intraclonal (geitonogamous) deposition of pollinia. ConclusionsCoelogyne fimbriata and Steveniella satyrioides are now the only orchid species known to have food-deceptive flowers that are pollinated exclusively by eusocial, worker wasps. In C. fimbriata, floral odour appears to be the major attractant. Sub-populations may go through flowering seasons when pollinators are abundant or infrequent, but fruit set always remains low because the obligate pollinator does not often appear to transfer pollinaria between intercompatible genets.",Coelogyne fimbriata; Floral odour; Food deception; Pollinarium removal; Pollinium deposition; Self-incompatibility; Vespula wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849093586

The floral biology of five species of Gentianaceae found in high-altitude neotropical grassland is presented, with emphasis on the mechanisms that promote spontaneous self-pollination. A presumed floral Batesian mimicry system is suggested between the rare and rewardless Zygostigma australe and Calydorea campestris, a species of Iridaceae with pollen-flowers, pollinated by syrphids and bees. The floral morphology of the other four gentian species points to three different pollination syndromes: melittophily, phalaenophily and ornithophily. However, with the exception of the nocturnal Helia oblongifolia, flowers are nectarless and appear to exhibit non-model deceptive mechanisms, providing similar floral cues to some sympatric rewarding species with the same syndrome. The similar mechanism of spontaneous self-pollination in Calolisianthus pedunculatus, Calolisianthus pendulus and H. oblongifolia (Helieae) is based on the stigmatic movements towards the anthers. Selfing is promoted by movements of the style/stigma and of the corolla in Deianira nervosa and Z. australe (Chironieae), respectively. The movements of stamens, style and stigma during anthesis seem to be the most common method of spontaneous self-pollination in angiosperms. It is suggested that the evolution of delayed spontaneous self-pollination would be more expected in those taxa with dichogamous flowers associated with herkogamy. Such a characteristic is frequent in long-lived flowers of certain groups of Asteridae, which comprise most documented cases of autonomous selfing. Thus, the presence of dichogamy associated with herkogamy (which supposedly evolved as a result of selection to promote both separation of male and female functions and the efficient transfer of cross pollen) may be the first step in the adaptive evolution of delayed selfing to provide reproductive assurance. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",Autonomous self-pollination; Exaptation traits; Flowering phenology; Nectary; Pollination by deceit; Sexual reproduction; South-eastern Brazil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68749083995

Among animal-pollinated crops, distylous plants strongly depend on animal pollination. In distylous pollination systems, pollinator species are usually limited, although flowers of some distylous plants are visited by diverse animals. We studied the pollination biology of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), a distylous crop mainly pollinated by honeybees and visited by many insect species, to evaluate the effects of non-honeybee species on pollination services. We focused on insects smaller than honeybees to determine their contribution to pollination. We applied pollination treatments with bags of coarse mesh to exclude flower visits by honeybees and larger insects and compared the seed set of bagged plants with that of untreated plants for pin and thrum flower morphs. We found a great reduction of seed set only in bagged pin flowers. We also confirmed that small insects, including ants, bees, wasps and flies, carried pin-morph pollen. These small insects transfer pollen from the short anthers of pin flowers to the short styles of thrum flowers, leading to sufficient seed set in thrum flowers. Consequently, small, non-honeybee insects have the potential to maintain at least half of the yield of this honeybee-dependent distylous crop. © 2009 The Authors.",Apis; Distyly; Formicidae; Heteromorphic self-incompatibility; Heterostylous; Heterostyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67749110446

We measured the seed set for hermaphroditic and female plant individuals. In both plant sexes and both regions, the seed set was positively related to the abundance of Apidae. The seed set was negatively related to the abundance of pollen-foraging solitary bees (Halictidae, Megachilidae) and beetles (Oedemeridae, Malachidae).

Thus, a central implication of the pollination syndrome concept, that floral trait evolution occurs primarily via specialized interactions of plants with their pollinators, has been questioned. However, broad surveys may not distinguish whether flower visitors are actual pollen vectors and hence lack power to assess the relationship between syndrome traits and the pollinators responsible for their evolution. Here we address whether the floral traits of three closely related hermaphroditic Silene spp. native to eastern North America (S. caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata) correspond to predicted specialized pollination based on floral differences among the three species and the congruence of these floral features with recognized pollination syndromes. A nocturnal/diurnal pollinator exclusion experiment demonstrated that all three Silene spp. have diurnal pollinators, and only S. stellata has nocturnal pollinators. Multiyear studies of visitation rates demonstrated that large bees, hummingbirds, and nocturnal moths were the most frequent pollinators of S. caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata, respectively. Estimates of pollen grains deposited and removed per visit generally corroborated the visitation rate results for all three species. However, the relatively infrequent diurnal hawkmoth pollinators of S. caroliniana were equally effective and more efficient than the most frequent large bee visitors. Pollinator importance (visitation × deposition) of each of the animal visitors to each species was estimated and demonstrated that in most years large bees and nocturnal moths were the most important pollinators of S. caroliniana and S. stellata, respectively. By quantifying comprehensive aspects of the pollination process we determined that S. virginica and S. stellata were specialized on hummingbirds and nocturnal moths, respectively, and S. caroliniana was the least specialized with diurnal hawkmoth and large bee pollinators. Compared across the Silene species, divergent floral character states are consistent with increasing the attraction and/or pollen transfer efficiency of their respective major pollinators, which suggests that the pollinators are past and/or contemporary selective agents for floral trait evolution in these three Silene species. We conclude that the pollination syndrome concept allows us to effectively relate the functional significance of floral morphology to the major pollinators of these Silene species. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Generalization; Pollination syndrome; Pollinator importance; Silene; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650982490

One important factor limiting female frequencies within populations is predicted to be pollen limitation of seed production, caused by either low abundance of pollen donors or insufficient pollen transfer. However, empirical studies measuring variation in pollen limitation with population sex ratios or resource gradients in gynodioecious plants are inconsistent. Part of this inconsistency may be that pollen limitation and its causes are context-dependent. Another possibility is that sex-specific daily flower production and/or sex-biased visitation are more relevant to the likelihood of pollen limitation than sex ratio based on counting individual plants. In this study, we examined context-dependent pollen limitation in gynodioecious/subdioecious Fragaria virginiana. We specifically examined the potential for resource availability to influence sex-specific daily flower production, sex-biased pollinator visitation, and their relationships with pollen limitation in experimental populations that contained either high or low frequencies of female plants. High resource availability reduced apparent female frequency by increasing daily flower production by hermaphrodites relative to females. This is important because pollinators increasingly discriminated against female flowers as floral sex ratios became more female-biased. Contrary to expectation, females in high-female populations were not consistently more pollen limited than those in low-female populations. The level of pollen limitation of females was better explained by sex-biased pollinator foraging and visitation frequency than by the plant sex ratio or floral sex ratio. Thus, negative frequency dependence of female pollen limitation was evident only considering sex ratio bias mediated by pollinator visitation. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149107561

The variable presence of petaloid features in other floral organs correlates with distinct adaptations to insect vs. wind pollination. Conical cells are present in sepals or stamens of insect-pollinated species, and in stigmas. We characterized a Thalictrum ortholog of the Antirrhinum majus transcription factor MIXTA-like2, responsible for conical cells, from three species with distinct floral morphologies, representing two pollination syndromes.  Genes were cloned by PCR and analysed phylogenetically. Expression analyses were conducted by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization, followed by functional studies in transgenic tobacco.  The cloned genes encode R2R3 MYB proteins closely related to Antirrhinum AmMYBML2 and Petunia hybrida PhMYB1. Spatial expression by in situ hybridization overlaps areas of conical cells. Overexpression in tobacco induces cell outgrowths in carpel epidermis and significantly increases the height of petal conical cells.  We have described the first orthologs of AmMIXTA-like2 outside the core eudicots, likely ancestral to the MIXTA/MIXTA-like1 duplication.

However, such information falls short of predicting the detailed network structure (the frequency of pairwise interactions), leaving a large amount of variation unexplained.

Restricted dispersal of genes can stimulate the increase of inbreeding as well as spatial clustering of relatives. These phenomena are explained by the theory of isolation-by-distance. Because of its biology, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seems to be susceptible to isolation-by-distance. However, to date fine-scale effects, including biparental inbreeding and a spatial genetic structure are not fully recognized for this species. In this study, two populations of European beech were investigated, both representing a dense beech forest, typical for Central Europe. Using nine microsatellite markers and a recently developed method, we found a significant level of biparental inbreeding in both populations. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that both populations exhibit clustering of related individuals up to 40 m. The observed spatial genetic structure fit well to the log-linear regression model. Thus, results confirmed our hypothesis of the presence of the isolation-by-distance effect. Furthermore, based on these results we inferred a dispersal mode, both for seeds and pollen; in particular, seed dispersal was 10-100 times more restricted than pollen flow, although a significant portion of short-distance pollinations responsible for biparental inbreeding cannot be excluded.",Biparental inbreeding; Dispersal; Fagus sylvatica; Isolation-by-distance; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70049110023

To counteract this decline, plantations of native species, often based on non-British planting stock, have been established. This may ultimately be detrimental to the integrity of the native gene pool. We explore the genetic and ecological factors influencing the success of components of the local pollen pool, including the effect of a non-native planting on an ancient woodland population of wild cherry. Wild cherry exhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) and vegetative reproduction, both of which may be determinants of paternal success. The majority (61%) of the successful pollen originated from within the study site with a maximum pollen transfer distance of 694 m. There was a distinct departure from random mating, with over half the successful pollen originating from trees which occur within 100 m of the mother tree. Self-incompatibility, clonality, tree size and proximity to the mother tree were all found to influence paternal success. Kinship of pollen gametes within a maternal progeny was highest when a mother tree was surrounded by a large number of ramets of a single, compatible clone consisting of large, adult trees. Although the contribution from the non-native plantation is currently low, it is likely that this will increasingly contribute to the progeny of the adjacent ancient population as it matures. The results clearly show that in self-incompatible species, such as P. avium, close neighbours may be pollinated by very different components of the local pollen pool. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Gene flow; Pollen; Prunus; S locus; Self- incompatibility; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349128985

Our results show that the timing of the onset of winter storage and incubation does affect prepupal weights, prepupal lipid and water contents, adult emergence, and adult female longevity. Winter storage of prepupae in November or December with a late June incubation resulted in heavier adults that emerged more readily than bees incubated in late May. However, adult females incubated in May thrived longer than June-incubated bees if fed a honey-water diet.

This study concerns the costs of reproduction in an alpine herb, Parnassia palustris L., in light of global warming. The field experiments involved manipulations of temperature regime using open top chambers, and manipulations of the current level of reproductive investment by supplemental hand-pollination (SP) and bud removal (BR). The study continued for 2 years and costs of reproduction were evaluated in the second year by comparing reproductive outputs and growth between treatment groups. Flower manipulations carried out the first year had no statistically significant effect on reproductive or somatic variables in the second year, which suggests that reproductive costs in P. palustris are limited. Increased temperature, however, had a positive effect on a range of reproductive traits such as seed number, seed mass per fruit, mass per seed, and ratios between reproductive outputs and growth, but had no statistically significant influence on growth. No statistically significant interaction effects between flower manipulation and warming were revealed, which implies that the effects of flower manipulation in the first year does not differ statistically significantly between the two temperature regimes in the next year. We conclude that the lack of reproductive costs found in P. palustris at Finse expresses that resources are not restricted under a level that will induce high costs of reproduction. Furthermore, higher temperatures do not affect the costs, and finally, it appears that the reproductive costs are fine-tune controlled, which implies optimizing rather than maximizing of reproductive and somatic outputs. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Alpine; Bud removal; Climate change; Experimental warming; Supplemental pollination; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63649133686

Its geographical range is in the warm-temperate to cool-temperate zone of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, Japan, extending further to the Korean Peninsula and China. Its growth form and seasonality are very unique, that is, the productive and reproductive phases are separate, which has been observed in other Lycoris species as well. In late March to mid-April for approximately 2 months, only radical leaves appear above ground; these leaves wither and disappear in late April to early May when the canopy of the deciduous trees casts heavy shade on the ground layer; then, in mid- to late-July when the forest floor becomes even darker, only scapes appear above ground, with two to six orange-red flowers borne on the umbels, occasionally forming large clumps here and there on the forest floor. Lycoris sanguinea is a typical insect-pollinated polycarpic perennial that is pollinated by small bees, such as Amegilla florae, and small butterflies, such as Thymelicus leoninus leoninus and Thymelicus sylvaticus sylvaticus. The seed output per plant is not very high, and 6-20 black spherical seeds, each approximately 6 mm in size, are produced. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Bulbous perennial; Insect pollination; Life-history characteristics; Polycarpy; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949194118

The states of the male and female reproductive systems, seed productivity elements, pollination features, and the viability of seeds produced by different pollination treatments were studied. For the three Glycyrrhiza species, the seed productivity indices were found to decrease considerably starting from the early stages of development of the female reproductive system and continuing to seed maturity. A quantitative analysis of seed productivity elements taking into account the flowering duration of the species showed that the seed production system of the species is very efficient; even in the introduced populations located north of the range, it is able to produce viable seeds in years with favorable growing conditions. Qualitative and quantitative indices of the reproductive system were used to characterize samples from the zone of contact between the ranges. Embryological analysis confirmed the possibility of interspecific hybridization and the prevalence of hybrid forms among the samples. A broad distribution of interspecific hybridization in Glycyrrhiza in various parts of the ranges is assumed. Glycyrrhiza species are characterized by seed and vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is limited in space but efficiently ensures reproduction of individuals and formation of vegetative clones. Seed reproduction is characterized by indices such as amphimictic seed formation, strict entomophily, and interspecific compatibility. Seed reproduction is a factor that controls the possibility of wide propagation of the genetic material in space and, hence, the formation of mixed and hybrid populations leading to a higher intraspecific and interspecific diversity of the genus. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2009.",Central Urals; Hybrid forms; Medicinal herbs; Reproductive system; Seed reproduction; Southern cis-Urals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350616038

The present study expands upon previous analyses by addressing pollen source effects on the growth of kernel structures (i.e. pericarp, endosperm and embryo), allocation of embryo chemical constituents (i.e. oil, protein, starch and soluble sugars), and the anatomy and histology of the embryos.MethodsMaize kernels with different oil concentration were obtained from pollinations with two parental genotypes of contrasting oil concentration. The dynamics of the growth of kernel structures and allocation of embryo chemical constituents were analysed during the post-flowering period. Mature kernels were dissected to study the anatomy (embryonic axis and scutellum) and histology [cell number and cell size of the scutellums, presence of sub-cellular structures in scutellum tissue (starch granules, oil and protein bodies)] of the embryos.Key ResultsPlants of all crosses exhibited a similar kernel number and kernel weight. Pollen source modified neither the growth period of kernel structures, nor pericarp growth rate. By contrast, pollen source determined a trade-off between embryo and endosperm growth rates, which impacted on the embryo/kernel ratio of mature kernels. Modifications to the embryo size were mediated by scutellum cell number. Pollen source also affected (P < 0·01) allocation of embryo chemical compounds. Negative correlations among embryo oil concentration and those of starch (r = 0·98, P < 0·01) and soluble sugars (r = 0·95, P < 0·05) were found. Coincidently, embryos with low oil concentration had an increased (P < 0·05-0·10) scutellum cell area occupied by starch granules and fewer oil bodies.ConclusionsThe effects of pollen source on both embryo/kernel ratio and allocation of embryo chemicals seems to be related to the early established sink strength (i.e. sink size and sink activity) of the embryos.",Embryo; Endosperm; Kernel; Maize; Oil; Pollen; Protein; Soluble sugars; Starch; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349128427

It remains unclear whether pollen susceptibility to rain damage plays a role in the evolution of floral form.  We investigated flower performance in rain and compared pollen longevity in dry conditions, pure water and solutions with different sucrose concentrations in 80 flowering species from 46 families with diverse floral shapes and pollination modes.  A pollen viability test showed that pollen longevity in all studied species was greatly reduced by wetting. We found that pollen of species with complete protection by flower structures was susceptible to water damage and a high proportion of resistant pollen occurred in unprotected species. Flowers whose structures expose pollen to rain may also reduce rain damage through temporal patterns of pollen presentation. This prediction was supported by our direct measurement of pollen presentation duration on rainy days.  Our observations showed that variation in pollen performance in water was associated with differences in floral forms. Water-resistant pollen and extended pollen presentation duration were favored by selection via rain contact in species in which pollen was not protected from rain.

This species has been extensively collected from the wild since the early 1900s, and today only a few plants remain in protected areas. As part of a conservation plan, a reproductive biology study was conducted to better understand the ecology of this species in Florida. Cyrtopodium punctatum relies on a deceit pollination system using aromatic compounds to attract pollinators. Nine aromatic compounds were identified as components of the fragrance of C. punctatum inflorescences, including two compounds that are known to be Euglossine bee attractants. However, this group of bees is not native to Florida. Of the four bee species observed to visit C. punctatum flowers in the present study, carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.) are likely to be the main pollinators. Pollination experiments demonstrated that C. puntatum is self-compatible, but requires a pollinator and thus does not exhibit spontaneous autogamy. In addition, the rates of fruit set were significantly higher for flowers that were outcrossed (xenogamy) than for those that were self-crossed. Thus, the species has evolved a degree of incompatibility. Examples of natural pollination and fruit set were observed during the present study (2007-2008), but the rates of reproduction were modest as a consequence of the low plant numbers and possible changes in insect densities as a result of anthropogenic influences. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Breeding system; Cyrtopodium punctatum; Orchidaceae; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949168830

This study examines the potential for centerto-edge gene flow to occur and estimates the fitness consequences of cross-gradient gene flow in an annual plant species restricted to California vernal pool wetlands. Phenological differences and highly focused foraging patterns of pollinators reduce the potential for center-to-edge gene flow across populations within pools. Furthermore, controlled crosses simulating different patterns of gene flow across the environmental gradient reveal that center-to-edge gene flow does not reduce plant fitness at the edge but instead yields an increase in emergence rates and a trend toward overall higher fitness. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Ecological specialization; Gene flow; Lasthenia fremontii; Plant distributions; Pollen limitation; Range limits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70149089004

Spurs of 21 orchid species selected from within four molecularly circumscribed clades of subtribe Orchidinae (based on Platanthera s.l., Gymnadenia-Dactylorhiza s.l., Anacamptis s.l., Orchis s.s.) were examined under light and scanning electron microscopes in order to estimate correlations between nectar production (categorized as absent, trace, reservoir), interior epidermal papillae (categorized as absent, short, medium, long) and epidermal cell striations (categorized as apparently absent, weak, moderate, strong). Closely related congeneric species scored similarly, but more divergent species showed less evidence of phylogenetic constraints. Nectar secretion was negatively correlated with striations and positively correlated with papillae, which were especially frequent and large in species producing substantial reservoirs of nectar. We speculate that the primary function of the papillae is conserving energy through nectar resorption and explain the presence of large papillae in a minority of deceit-pollinated species by arguing that the papillae improve pollination because they are a tactile expectation of pollinating insects. In contrast, the prominence of striations may be a 'spandrel', simply reflecting the thickness of the overlying cuticle. Developmentally, the spur is an invagination of the labellum; it is primarily vascularized by a single 'U'-shaped primary strand, with smaller strands present in some species.

It has also generated some classic studies of speciation in Platanthera sections Platanthera and Limnorchis. However, it has proved rich in taxonomic controversy and near-monotypic genera. The clade is reviewed via a new molecular phylogenetic analysis and those results are combined with brief reconsideration of morphology in the group, aiming to rationalize the species into a smaller number of larger monophyletic genera and sections.MethodsNuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained from 86 accessions of 35 named taxa, supplemented from GenBank with five accessions encompassing a further two named taxa.Key ResultsUsing Pseudorchis as outgroup, and scoring indels, the data matrix generated 30 most-parsimonious trees that differed in the placement of two major groups plus two closely related species. Several other internal nodes also attracted only indifferent statistical support. Nonetheless, by combining implicit assessment of morphological divergence with explicit assessment of molecular divergence (when available), nine former genera can be rationalized into four revised genera by sinking the monotypic Amerorchis, together with Aceratorchis and Chondradenia (neither yet sequenced), into Galearis, and by amalgamating Piperia, Diphylax and the monotypic Tsaiorchis into the former Platanthera section Platanthera. After further species sampling, this section will require sub-division into at least three sections. The present nomenclatural adjustments prompt five new combinations.ConclusionsResolution of major groups should facilitate future species-level research on the Platanthera clade. Recent evidence suggests that ITS sequence divergence characterizes most species other than the P. bifolia group. The floral differences that distinguished Piperia, Diphylax and Tsaiorchis from Platanthera, and Aceratorchis and Chondradenia from Galearis, reflect various forms of heterochrony (notably paedomorphosis); this affected both the perianth and the gynostemium, and may have proved adaptive in montane habitats. Floral reduction was combined with lateral expansion of the root tubers in Piperia and Diphylax (including Tsaiorchis), whereas root tubers were minimized in the putative (but currently poorly supported) Neolindleya-Galearis clade. Allopolyploidy and/or autogamy strongly influenced speciation in Platanthera section Limnorchis and perhaps also Neolindleya. Reproductive biology remains an important driver of evolution in the clade, though plant-pollinator specificity and distinctness of the species boundaries have often been exaggerated.",Aceratorchis; Amerorchis; Chondradenia; Diphylax; Galearis; Generic delimitation; Internal transcribed spacer; Neolindleya; Orchid; Phylogeny; Piperia; Platanthera; Pseudorchis; Speciation; Tsaiorchis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849120878

It is assumed to be gametophytically determined and genetically controlled by the S-locus, which in other species encodes for glycoproteins (S-RNases) showing ribonuclease activity. To investigate pollen-pistil interaction, the pollen tube growth of two clementine varieties, 'Comune' (self-incompatible) and 'Monreal' (a 'Comune' self-compatible mutation) was analysed by histological assays in self-and cross-pollination conditions. Cross-pollination assays demonstrated that the mutation leading to self-compatibility in 'Monreal' occurred in the stylar tissues. Similar rates of pollen germination were observed in both genotypes. However, 'Comune' pollen tubes showed altered morphology and arrested growth in the upper style while in 'Monreal' they grew straight to ward the ovary. Moreover, to identify genes putatively involved in pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility, research based on the complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism technique was carried out to compare the transcript profiles of unpollinated and self-pollinated styles and stigmas of the two cultivars. This analysis identified 96 unigenes such as receptor-like kinases, stress-induced genes, transcripts involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, transcription factors and genes related to calcium and hormone signalling. Surprisingly, a high percentage of active long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons were identified among the unigenes, indicating their activation in response to pollination and their possible role in the regulation of self-in compatibility genes.The quantitative reverse trascription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected gene tags showed transcriptional differences between the two genotypes during pollen germination and pollen tube elongation. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",CDNA-AFLP; Citrus clementina Hort; Ex Tan.

This correlation is usually explained by the assertion that nectar- or pollen-stealing bees are ""blind"" to red flowers. However, laboratory studies have shown that bees are capable of locating artificial red flowers and often show no innate preference for blue over red. We hypothesised that these findings might be artefacts of the simplified laboratory environment. Using bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) that had been trained to visit red and blue artificial flowers, we tested whether colour preference was influenced by complexity of the background on which they were foraging. Many bees were indifferent to flower colour when tested using a uniform green background like those commonly used in laboratory studies, but all bees showed strong colour preferences (usually for blue) when flowers were presented against a photograph of real foliage. Overall, preference for blue flowers was significantly greater on the more realistic, complex background. These results support the notion that the red of ""hummingbird syndrome"" flowers can function to reduce bee visits despite the ability of bees to detect red and highlight the need to consider context when drawing inferences about pollinator preferences from laboratory data. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Colour; Ornithophily; Pollination syndromes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349106939

Neotinea maculata is a rare orchid of conservation concern at the edge of its range in Ireland, where it occurs in small populations. However, it is relatively common throughout the Mediterranean region. Here, factors that affect rarity of N. maculata in Ireland are investigated by comparing Irish populations with those found in Italy, where it is more common.MethodsVegetation communities, breeding system and genetic diversity were compared using three amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs in populations in Ireland and Italy. Vegetation was quantified using quadrats taken along transects in study populations, and hand pollination experiments were performed to assess reliance of N. maculata on pollinators in both Irish and Italian populations.Key ResultsNeotinea maculata occupies different vegetation communities in Italian and Irish populations. Breeding system experiments show that N. maculata is 100 autogamous, and there are no differences in fruit and seed production in selfed, outcrossed and unmanipulated plants. AFLP markers revealed that Irish and Italian populations have similar genetic diversity and are distinct from each other.ConclusionsNeotinea maculata does not suffer any negative effects of autogamous reproduction; it self-pollinates and sets seed readily in the absence of pollinators. It occupies a variety of habitats in both Ireland and Italy; however, Irish populations are small and rare and should be conserved. This could be due to climatic factors and the absence of suitable soil mycorrhizas to allow recruitment from seed.",AFLP; Autogamy; Conservation; Genetic diversity; Lusitanian species; Neotinea maculata; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849116711

However, data on pollinator assemblages can be scant. Field observation of crop flower visitors is a common data collection technique but it can be inadequate for species identification and is labour-intensive if used across many sites. Trapping may reduce this problem, but trap performance and sampling consistency over long distances (sites separated by >100 km) are rarely examined. Window traps were designed to collect flower-visiting arthropods from peak-flowering onion (Allium cepa) and pak choi (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) fields across several regions throughout New Zealand. Trap efficacy was evaluated by comparing trapped samples with observations of flower visiting arthropods during the same trapping period, from dawn (6:00 to 7:00 hours) through to dusk (20:00-21:00 hours) at the same locations. Similar types of larger arthropods (length ?3 mm) were observed and trapped within both crops, with the hymenopteran genera Apidae, Colletidae and Halictidae and the dipteran families Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, Anthomyiidae, Stratiomyidae, Sarcophagidae, Bibionidae, Tachinidae and Muscidae the most commonly recorded. The total counts of these taxa across fields were strongly correlated between the two methods; however, the ratio of trapped to observed individuals could vary greatly between taxa. Trapping allowed more arthropods to be identified to the species level and also helped record more small arthropods (body length <3 mm) when compared with observation. Window traps can be effective for assessing the relative diversity of flower visitor assemblages and the abundance of specific taxa in specific cropping systems at the regional scale, but variation in trap efficiency between arthropod taxa must be assessed for a true measure of assemblage composition. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",Brassica; Crop pollination; Diptera; Hymenoptera; New Zealand; Onion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67749113770

In this work, several aspects of the reproductive biology (flowering phenology, floral biology, breeding system) and potential limits on seed quantity and quality (pollen limitation, inbreeding depression) were studied in natural populations of three endangered species of the genus (Antirrhinum charidemi, Antirrhinum subbaeticum, Antirrhinum valentinum). Results disclose that all three species need insect visitors for seed production since fruit set after autonomous self-pollination was lower than under hand cross-pollination. A. charidemi and A. valentinum were mainly self-incompatible, whereas A. subbaeticum was self-compatible but herkogamous. Supplementary pollination in open-pollinated flowers only increased fruit set and seed set relative to controls in a given population of A. valentinum. Preliminary data on inbreeding depression at early life-cycle stages of the self-compatible A. subbaeticum revealed that the cumulative level was low. Despite the three species being closely related and sharing many ecological characteristics, they show different mating systems, and different factors limit seed quantity and quality. Thus, caution should be taken when making a common conservation plan for a group of closely related taxa. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative study is a powerful approach for elucidating the relative importance of individual isolating barriers in the speciation process. A recent contribution by Scopece and colleagues provides comparative data for two groups of deceptive pollination orchids and aims to test hypotheses about which forms of isolation are most important in the two clades. The authors compare pollinator isolation and postmating isolation between the two orchid groups, and conclude that food-deceptive orchid species have less isolation by pollinator specificity than sexually deceptive species, and that postmating isolation is more important in the food-deceptive clade. Although we find this approach to be novel and potentially powerful, these conclusions are called into question by the methods used to define and select species and quantify pollinator isolation. Definition and selection of taxa were performed in a biased manner that undermines the ability to infer general patterns of speciation. Furthermore, pollinator isolation was calculated inconsistently for the two groups under study, effectively nullifying the comparison. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Pollinator isolation; Postmating barriers; Premating barriers; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149089477

The potential gene flow from two transgenic rice lines containing the bar gene to five accessions of weedy rice (WR1-WR5) was determined through examination of reproductive compatibility under controlled pollination. RESULTS: The pollen grain germination of two transgenic rice lines on the stigma of all weedy rice, rice pollen tube growth down the style and entry in to the weedy rice ovary were similar to self-pollination in weedy rice. However, delayed double fertilisation and embryo abortion in crosses between WR2 and Y0003 were observed. Seed sets between transgenic rice lines and weedy rice varied from 8 to 76%. Although repeated pollination increased seed set significantly, the rank of the seed set between the weedy rice accessions and rice lines was not changed. The germination rates of F1 hybrids were similar or greater compared with respective females. All F1 plants expressed glufosinate resistance in the presence of glufosinate selection pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of geneflow between different weedy rice accessions and transgenic herbicide-resistantrice may differ owing to different reproductive compatibility. This result suggests that, when wild relatives are selected as experimental materials for assessing the gene flow of transgenic rice, it is necessary to address the compatibility between transgenic rice and wild relatives. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",Gene flow; Reproductive compatibility; Transgenic rice with bar; Weedy rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249229717

Although pollen quantity and quality are known to be important for larval growth, little is known about how nectar quality limits solitary bee performance. By adding different levels of nectar sugar directly to solitary bee provisions in the subalpine of Colorado, we tested the degree to which larval performance (development time, mass, and survival) was limited by nectar sugar. We found that larval growth increased with nectar sugar addition, with the highest larval mass in the high nectar-sugar addition treatment (50% honey solution). The shortest larval development time was observed in the low nectar-sugar addition treatment (25% honey solution). Neither low nor high nectar-sugar addition affected larval survival. This study suggests that, in addition to pollen, nectar- sugar concentration can limit solitary bee larval growth and development, and nectar should be considered more explicitly as a currency governing foraging decisions related to producing optimally sized offspring. The availability and sugar content of nectar may scale up to affect bee fitness, population dynamics, and plant pollinator mutualisms. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Hoplitis; Megachile; Osmia; Pollinator performance; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849092138

To assist vulnerable rural households improve their food security, the British Department for International Development implemented a seed relief program from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 that emphasized recycling of maize open pollinated varieties (OPV). Using data collected from 597 households in six districts in 2006, this study assesses the effectiveness of the program in terms of its targeting of beneficiaries, the flow of information from participating NGOs to beneficiaries on the need to recycle the seeds, and the level of recycling done at the end of the program. The empirical results suggest that the targeting method participating NGOs use inadvertently excludes relatively vulnerable households while including large proportions of relatively well-endowed households in the program. The choice of varieties to distribute is guided more by the ecological adaptability of available commercial seeds and less by preferences of beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that seed selection information is critical in encouraging beneficiaries to recycle distributed seed, not all of them received it. In conclusion, it may be stated that the program undoubtedly contributed to increased food productivity by vulnerable households but its overall effectiveness could have been enhanced through (i) the involvement of the beneficiaries in the choice of types of seed to be distributed, (ii) better targeting of beneficiaries, and (iii) improved information flow between NGOs and beneficiaries. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In essence, lip/column relationships reflect syndromes associated with pollinator preferences; most genera of Oncidiinae as previously defined have consisted of a single floral type. Here, the degree to which this has influenced generic delimitation in Brazilian members of the largest genus of Oncidiinae, Oncidium, which previous molecular (DNA) studies have demonstrated to be polyphyletic, is evaluated.MethodsPhylogenetic analyses of the following multiple DNA regions were used: the plastid psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, matK exon and two regions of ycf1 exon and nuclear ribosomal DNA, comprised of the two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5·8S gene. Results from all regions analysed separately indicated highly similar relationships, so a combined matrix was analysed.Key ResultsNearly all species groups of Brazilian Oncidium are only distantly related to the type species of the genus, O. altissimum, from the Caribbean. There are two exceptions to this geographical rule: O. baueri is related to the type group and O. orthostates, an isolated species that lacks the defining tabula infrastigmata of Oncidium, is not exclusively related to any previously described genus in the subtribe. Several well-supported subclades can be observed in these results, but they do not correspond well to sections of Oncidium as previously circumscribed or to segregate genera as defined by several recent authors. In spite of their floral differences, these groups of Oncidium, formerly treated as O. sections Barbata, Concoloria pro parte, Crispa, Ranifera, Rhinocerotes, Rostrata (only O. venustum), Synsepala, Verrucituberculata pro parte and Waluewa, form a well-supported clade with Gomesa (including Rodrigueziella and Rodrigueziopsis) embedded in it. Two often recognized segregate genera, Baptistonia and Ornithophora, and the recently described Carriella are also embedded within the Brazilian clade. The level of variation within major subclades of the Gomesa clade is low and similar to that observed within other genera of Oncidiinae.ConclusionsConvergence on a stereotypical syndrome of floral traits associated with pollination by oil-collecting bees has resulted in these characters not being reliable for producing monophyletic taxa, and the genus Oncidium, defined by these characters, is grossly polyphyletic. Vegetative and a few floral/inflorescence characters link these taxa with a mainly Brazilian distribution, and they were all transferred to Gomesa on this basis rather than separated from Gomesa based on their floral differences, which we hypothesize to be simple shifts in pollination strategies. Other authors have described a large number of new genera for these former members of Oncidium, but most of these are not supported by the results presented here (i.e. they are not monophyletic). A new genus, Nohawilliamsia, is described for O. orthostates because it does not fit in any currently recognized genus and is only distantly related to any other member of Oncidiinae.",Baptistonia; Brazilian orchids; Carriella; Deceit pollination; Gomesa; ITS; MatK; Oil-collecting bees; Oncidiinae; Oncidium; Orchidaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849090211

I evaluate the effects of weak self-incompatibility (SI) in Phlox cuspidata and SI in Phlox drummondii on mating success within species and on hybridization dynamics between species under controlled conditions. The effects of SI on hybridization frequency were assessed by manipulating the relatedness of conspecific pollen and the relative timing of pollen deposition in mixed-donor interspecific pollinations. Selfing as opposed to outcrossing increased hybridization by 16% in P. cuspidata maternal plants and by 48% in P. drummondii maternal plants because self pollen did not compete as well against heterospecific pollen. The relative timing of conspecific versus heterospecific pollen deposition also impacted hybridization. In self-compatible P. cuspidata, the deposition of self pollen 5 h earlier than heterospecific pollen decreased hybridization by 28%. In self-incompatible P. drummondii, a 5 h delay in the deposition of compatible conspecific pollen increased hybridization by 32%. In this hybrid system, early self-pollination can decrease hybridization (but increase inbreeding) by P. cuspidata maternal plants, and SI may increase hybridization by P. drummondii maternal plants. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Hybridization; Interspecific pollen competition; Mixed-donor pollinations; Phlox hybrid system; Self-fertilization; Self-incompatibility (SI),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350714946

Here we analysed the genetic structure of relict populations of the temperate plant Shortia rotundifolia on the subtropical island of Iriomotejima, Japan. This plant, which inhabits riparian environments, is designated ""near threatened"". Only five extant populations have been found on the island. Our analyses of 10 nuclear microsatellite loci detected genetic diversity of H E = 0.488 and H O = 0.358 for all populations of S. rotundifolia on the island. A high inbreeding coefficient for all populations together (F IS = 0.316) and each population separately (F IS = 0.258-0.497) might be attributable to crossing among closely related descendants within a population, an idea that is supported by the relatedness coefficient. These results and an examination of the populations' demographic histories suggest that the extant populations on Iriomotejima have not experienced a recent population bottleneck. The five extant populations were genetically differentiated (F ST = 0.283; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting low seed dispersal by gravity and/or low pollen flow via pollinators in the riparian environment. In addition, population differentiation was not related to genetic distance, implying that at one time, ancestral populations might have been distributed over a wider area of the island. However, population fragmentation and range contraction might have occurred at random during the postglacial period. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Gene flow; Microsatellite; Refugia; Ryukyu Islands; Shortia rotundifolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649306965

Human land use and the loss of native habitats is thought to be an important driver of decline for wild, native pollinators, yet the findings of published studies on this topic have never been quantitatively synthesized. Here we use meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on how bees, the most important group of pollinators, are affected by human disturbances such as habitat loss, grazing, logging, and agriculture. We obtained 130 effect sizes from 54 published studies recording bee abundance and/or species richness as a function of human disturbance. Both bee abundance and species richness were significantly, negatively affected by disturbance. However, the magnitude of the effects was not large. Furthermore, the only disturbance type showing a significant negative effect, habitat loss and fragmentation, was statistically significant only in systems where very little natural habitat remains. Therefore, it would be premature to draw conclusions about habitat loss having caused global pollinator decline without first assessing the extent to which the existing studies represent the status of global ecosystems.

Recognition in SSI systems is typically controlled by a complex locus (S-locus) with separate genes that determine pollen and stigma specificity. Experimental studies show that S-alleles can be dominant, recessive, or codominant, and that the dominance level of a given S-allele can depend upon whether pollen or stigma specificity is examined. Here and in the companion paper by Llaurens and colleagues, the evolution of dominance in single-locus SSI is explored using numerical models and simulation. Particular attention is directed at factors that can cause S-allele dominance to differ in pollen versus stigma. The effect of recombination between the S-locus and modifier locus is also examined. The models predict that limitation in the number of compatible mates is required for the evolution of S-allele dominance in the stigma but not in the pollen. Tight linkage between the S-locus and modifier promotes the evolution of S-allele dominance hierarchies. Model results are interpreted with respect to published information on the molecular basis of dominance in SSI systems, and reported S-allele dominance relationships in a variety of species. These studies show that dominant S-alleles are more common in the pollen than in the stigma, a pattern that when interpreted in light of model predictions, suggests that mate limitation may be relatively infrequent in natural populations with SSI. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Frequency-dependent selection; Mate limitation; Plant mating systems; Population genetics; Self-pollen recognition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149107584

These were the parental and animal models. Additive variance components and breeding values estimated from different amounts of information were compared for both models.

The EST sequences (HVSMEh and HVSMEi) were derived from cDNA libraries of the elite six-rowed cultivar Morex, made from spikes harvested at 5 to 45 days after pollination. Approximately half of the 110 SSR markers derived from the ESTs were polymorphic in a panel of 8 diverse barley genotypes, with PIC values between 0.19 and 0.79. Twenty of the new markers were mapped to chromosomal locations using 2 doubled haploid populations. To demonstrate marker potential, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses were carried out with phenotypic data on wort ?-glucan content and ?-glucanase activity, two traits with a long history of genetic studies. Most of the EST-SSR markers mapped to within 10 cM of the cellulose synthase (HvCesA) and cellulose synthase-like (HvCslF) genes, which provides highly informative functional markers for tracking these genes in breeding programs. It was also observed that on any given chromosome, the QTL for ?-glucan content and ?-glucanase activity were rarely coincident but tended to occur in adjacent intervals along chromosomal regions, which agreed with their independent genetic basis; the adjacent localization may be important for coordination of cell wall degradation during germination and malting.",?-glucan; ?-glucanase; Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); EST-SSR; Expressed sequence tag (EST); Simple sequence repeat (SSR),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949183477

These factors are particularly relevant for native bees and exotic honeybees, essential crop pollinators that are sensitive to floral resources and habitat management, and that have recently exhibited alarming population declines. Mechanisms driving native and exotic bee foraging patterns may critically depend on floral resource availability and habitat composition, yet the impacts of these factors on bee foraging have never been simultaneously analyzed. In a coffee producing region in southern Mexico, we investigated the influence of coffee floral resource levels and habitat management on native and exotic bee foraging. We measured the amount of flowering coffee available at multiple spatial scales within two distinct agroforestry habitat types (high-shade and low-shade coffee) and recorded visits to coffee flowers, documenting bee species, visit duration and visit frequency. We observed a significantly greater number of visits in high-shade coffee habitats than in low-shade coffee habitats for both native and exotic bees. In high-shade coffee habitats, native solitary bee and native social bee visitation decreased significantly in response to increasing floral resource availability, exhibiting a 'dilution effect' at the smallest spatial scale. In contrast, in low-shade coffee habitats, Africanized honeybees exhibited a 'concentration effect', increasing visitation significantly in response to increasing floral resource availability at the largest spatial scale. This study is the first to show that foraging patterns of native bees and exotic honeybees contrast in response to floral resource level and scale and that this response is mediated by the vegetation management of the local habitat. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149176516

Theoretical studies have argued that the transition from outcrossing to selfing is accomplished more easily than the reverse case, and phylogenetic analyses involving self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species has basically supported this assumption. The evolutionary direction of self-compatibility and self-incompatibility was examined in Trillium camschatcense, which contains geographically widespread SC populations, and restricted SI populations. Ecological surveys have revealed that the SC populations were suitable for outcrossing, and selfing in these populations did not confer any fitness advantage. Since reproductive fitness indicates the possibility of an evolutionary shift from self-compatibility to self-incompatibility, the phylogenetic relationships of SI and SC populations of T. camschatcense were investigated based on cpDNA variations and nuclear DNA microsatellite polymorphisms. Although phylogenetic analyses did not provide credible evidence to determine evolutionary direction, the SI populations turned out to be monophyletic with extremely low genetic differentiation.

The entire course of seed development lasted ?49 days and it can be divided into seven sequential stages (I to VII). During the early stages (I to III, 7 to 21 DAP), seed grew rapidly, showing a dramatic increase in size and fresh weight. They contained ?75% water. During midmaturation stages (IV to V, 28 to 35 DAP), storage lipids, proteins, and other components of dry weights accumulated at maximum rates. The accumulation curves followed a sigmoidal pattern during seed development. As a result of water loss, fresh weight dropped significantly when seed progressed to late-maturation/desiccation stages (VI to VII, 42 to 49 DAP). The size of the seed decreased slightly and the color changed from green to orange-brown. Seed proteins were also analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Proteins with high molecular weights were prominent in developing seed at early stages (I to III). At Stage IV (28 DAP), proteins with low molecular weight appeared, whereas the high-molecular-weight proteins decreased in proportion. These low-molecular-weight proteins became predominant throughout the remaining stages of seed development. Forty-seven percent of freshly harvested seed at 35 DAP were able to germinate after 7 days incubation. The germination percentage increased to a maximum of 95% at 42 DAP after 7 days incubation.

We developed a statistical and computational model for estimating and testing these parameters from multilocus data collected in a natural population. This model, constructed by a maximum likelihood approach and implemented within the EM algorithm, is shown to be robust for simultaneously estimating the outcrossing rate, recombination frequencies and linkage disequilibria. The algorithm built with three or more markers allows the characterization of crossover interference in meiosis and high-order disequilibria among different genes, thus providing a powerful tool for illustrating a detailed picture of genetic diversity and organization in natural populations. Computer simulations demonstrate the statistical properties of the proposed model.

The policosanol composition of whole corn kernel was determined in three varieties of corn (Astro, GH2547, Local). The total policosanol content of GH2547 (20.5 mg/kg of dry weight) was higher than those of Local (16.6 mg/kg) and Astro (15.2 mg/kg). The major policosanol components of whole corn kernel were dotriacontanol, triacontanol and tetracosanol. The distribution of policosanol in the germ, endosperm and pericarp of corn kernels was also determined. Corn pericarp had higher contents of policosanols (72.7-110.9 mg/kg) than the endosperm (4.0-16.2 mg/kg) and germ (19.3-37.1 mg/kg) fractions. Corn pericarp policosanol was mainly triacontanol (33.63-46.29 mg/kg), dotriacontanol (22.31-39.46 mg/kg) and octacosanol (8.13-14.0 mg/kg). In contrast, the corn germ fraction contained mostly dotriacontanol (more than 50%) and no triacontanol. The main components of corn endosperm policosanol were triacontanol and hexacosanol. The level of tetracosanol was highest in the germ fraction and lowest in the endosperm fraction. The greatest change in policosanol content (expressed as mg/100 g of oil) occurred during the early stages of corn kernel development. Although the structures of the alcohol constituents of policosanol are similar, their patterns of accumulation were different. The highest levels of octacosanol and dotriacontanol were detected at 20 days after pollination (DAP) followed by a rapid decrease between 20 and 30 DAP.

Here, two claims that epithelial, floral elaiophores occur in the genus Rudolfiella Hoehne (Bifrenaria clade) are investigated. Presumed elaiophores were compared with those of Oncidiinae Benth. and the floral, resin-secreting tissues of Rhetinantha M.A. Blanco and Heterotaxis Lindl., both genera formerly assigned to Maxillaria Ruiz & Pav. (Maxillariinae sensu stricto).MethodsPutative, floral elaiophore tissue of Rudolfiella picta (Schltr.) Hoehne and floral elaiophores of Oncidium ornithorhynchum H.B.K. were examined by means of light microscopy, histochemistry, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.Key Results and ConclusionsFloral, epithelial elaiophores are present in Rudolfiella picta, indicating, for the first time, that oil secretion occurs amongst members of the Bifrenaria clade (Maxillariinae sensu lato). However, whereas the elaiophore of R. picta is borne upon the labellar callus, the elaiophores of O. ornithorhynchum occur on the lateral lobes of the labellum. In both species, the elaiophore comprises a single layer of palisade secretory cells and parenchymatous, subsecretory tissue. Cell wall cavities are absent from both and there is no evidence of cuticular distension in response to oil accumulation between the outer tangential wall and the overlying cuticle in R. picta. Distension of the cuticle, however, occurs in O. ornithorhynchum. Secretory cells of R. picta contain characteristic, spherical or oval plastids with abundant plastoglobuli and these more closely resemble plastids found in labellar, secretory cells of representatives of Rhetinantha (formerly Maxillaria acuminata Lindl. alliance) than elaiophore plastids of Oncidiinae. In Rhetinantha, such plastids are involved in the synthesis of resin-like material or wax. Despite these differences, the elaiophore anatomy of both R. picta (Bifrenaria clade) and O. ornithorhynchum (Oncidiinae) fundamentally resembles that of several representatives of Oncidiinae. These, in their possession of palisade secretory cells, in turn, resemble the floral elaiophores of certain members of Malpighiaceae, indicating that convergence has occurred here in response to similar pollination pressures.",Bifrenaria clade; Elaiophore; Floral oil; Heterotaxis; Maxillariinae; Oncidiinae; Oncidium ornithorhynchum; Rhetinantha; Rudolfiella picta; Secretion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349157468

Knowledge of the coefficient of coancestry (&thetas;) is a requirement for efficient progeny testing scheme and for estimating additive variance components for any quantitative trait. When using open-pollinated families, most authors assume that the seedlings are related as half-sibs, but this is not always true. Our aim was to estimate a mean value of the coancestry coefficient of the families present in a maritime pine Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime or cluster pine) progeny trial originating from seed collected in a clonal seed orchard and to study how deviations from the standard assumption of thetas; = 0.125 affect heritability estimations. Five highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were scored in 125 offspring from a subsample of five families from the progeny trial. The mean value of the coancestry coefficient of the families present in this progeny trial was 0.130. Differences between the unadjusted and adjusted heritability estimates were more pronounced in wood density (0.609 and 0.586, respectively) than in diameter (0.166 and 0.154, respectively). We conclude that in the trial, the associated error in heritability estimates due to the inclusion of full-sibs, when assuming a standard coefficient of relationship among open-pollinated sibs of 0.250, was low and that this result is robust with respect to the number of families sampled, given unbiased estimates of average relationship among offspring within sib families. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Coefficient of coancestry; Microsatellite markers; Pinus pinaster,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349805116

We characterized three lily (Lilium longiflorum) SKP1-like genes, LSK1LSK3, that are specifically expressed in late pollen developmental stages and the elongating pollen tube. The encoded peptide sequences reveal that LSK1LSK3 share high identity with Arabidopsis ASK1 and contain a putative N-terminal CUL1- and a C-terminal F-box-interacting domain. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro affinity binding assays revealed that the LSKs associate with lily CULLIN1. In addition, the LSK genes can functionally complement the yeast skp1 deletion mutant YDR328C. To investigate their biological functions in pollen tube elongation, an in vivo approach for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged dominant-negative LSK1LSK3 was developed. Microprojectile bombardment with N-terminally truncated LSK1LSK3 (LSK1LSK3?GFP) significantly retarded pollen tube elongation in both in vitro germination and in vivo self- and cross-pollination after >12 h incubation. Interestingly, elongation of pollen tubes harboring overexpressed LSK2?GFP and LSK3?GFP was substantially inhibited within the self-pollinated styles. The elongation of most LSK2?GFP-transformed pollen tubes could germinate only on the stigmatic surface of self style and showed statistically significant growth arrest as compared with control pollen tubes. Lily exhibits typical gametophytic self-incompatibility via an unknown mechanism, but LSK2 and LSK3 may be involved in this complex machinery. These results suggest critical roles for LSK1LSK3 in regulating fundamental pollen tube elongation in vitro and in vivo and that the 26S proteasome-mediated protein pathway plays an important role in pollen tube elongation.",Lily (Lilium longiflorum); LLCUL1; LSK; Pollen tube elongation; SCF complex; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949157432

These parameters can be manipulated at establishment by varying clonal representation (e.g., linear deployment), during orchard development by genetic thinning, or by selective harvesting. Since clonal fecundities are known to vary both within and among years, then each seed crop has a unique genetic composition and, therefore, crops should be treated on a yearly basis. Here we present an optimization protocol that maximizes crop's genetic gain at any desired genetic diversity through the selection of a subset of the crop that meets both parameters. The genetic gain is maximized within the biological limit set by each clone's seed-cone production and effective population size is used as a proxy to genetic diversity whereby any relationship among clones is considered. The optimization was illustrated using 3 years' reproductive output data from a first-generation western larch seed orchard and was tested under various scenarios including actual male and female reproductive output and male reproductive output assumed to be either equal to that of female or a function of clonal representation. Furthermore, various levels of co-ancestry were assigned to the orchard's clones in supplementary simulations. Following the optimization, all solutions were effective in creating custom seedlots with different gain and diversity levels and provided the means to estimate the genetic properties of composite seedlots encompassing the remaining ""unused"" seed from a number of years. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Diversity; Genetic gain; Optimization; Seed orchard; Western larch,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349676104

Of these four species, the giant honeybee A. dorsata (which forages during moonlit nights) has the lowest spatial resolution and the most sensitive eyes, followed by A. mellifera, A. cerana and the dwarf honeybee, A. florea (which has the smallest acceptance angles and the least sensitive eyes). Moreover, unlike the strictly diurnal A. cerana and A. florea, A. dorsata possess large ocelli, a feature that it shares with all dim-light bees. However, the eyes of the facultatively nocturnal A. dorsata are much less sensitive than those of known obligately nocturnal bees such as Megalopta genalis in Panama and Xylocopa tranquebarica in India. The differences in sensitivity between the eyes of A. dorsata and other strictly diurnal Apis species cannot alone explain why the former is able to fly, orient and forage at half-moon light levels.

The durable flower lifespan, the competitive effects among flowers and the different outcomes from spontaneous and hand-performed pollinations (with both self- and cross-pollen) suggested low pollination rates in the experimental stand. Pollinator exclusion experiments revealed a low frequency of delayed autonomous selfing, suggesting that self-fertilization in D. guliae relies mainly on facilitated selfing and geitonogamy. Studies of inbreeding depression during the early life-history stages revealed significant differences between selfed and crossed progenies in terms of seed mass, germination rates, developmental vigour and mortality rates. Therefore, when pollen delivery is scarce, the plant may fail reproductive assurance via autonomous selfing. The influence of inbreeding depression contributes to a further reduction in recruitment chances in very small D. guliae populations. Experimental reintroductions are urgent to avoid local extinction at the southern periphery of its range. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Conservation; Dianthus; Inbreeding depression; Pollen limitation; Reproductive assurance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949167351

In three populations variability of 64 RAPD loci was tested. The level of genetic diversity (P95% = 30.2; Hexp = 0.093) was low for a cross-pollinating plant species. Furthermore, genetic similarity between the plants from insular populations was found to be high (IN = 0.887). It was demonstrated that genetic variation among the population accounted for at most 5.3% of total genetic diversity, which, however, was higher than the FST values for continental populations (FST = 0.022). It was suggested that specific features of the genetic structure of insular population, i.e., low gene diversity within the populations along with high differentiation among the populations, were caused by the gene flow attenuation, as a result of isolation, and intensification of inbreeding.

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Cutting; NPK fertilizer; Phytophagous; Plant species richness; Pollinators; Predatory; Sward architecture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649939175

Our sampling represents a wide taxonomic and geographic diversity from within the family. Results from maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses provide strong evidence for two major clades in the family, with the platycodonoids sister to the remaining members of the family, the wahlenbergioids and campanuloids. There are two clear divisions within the campanuloids that correspond well with the historical Campanula s.str. and Rapunculus groups of Boissier and Fedorov. The phylogenetic positions of the Northern European species Wahlenbergia hederacea and the genus Jasione remain unresolved.

Oocytes are a sensitive indicator of protein utilisation and general metabolic processes. We also calculated carbohydrate concentrations in the haemolymph to examine energetic costs of gelsemine consumption. 4. High concentrations of gelsemine significantly reduced mean oocyte width in subordinate bees, while dominant bees showed only a trend towards oocyte inhibition. Gelsemine consumption did not reduce carbohydrate concentrations in haemolymph. 5. The cost of ingesting gelsemine may be due to direct toxicity of alkaloids or may be an expense associated with detoxifying gelsemine.

Using this approach, we investigate the complex reproductive system of the invasive Lespedeza cuneata (Dum.-Cours.) G. Don in relation to three native congeners in the variable environment of the North American tallgrass prairie. Lespedeza species produce both chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers, and propagate clonally via vegetative buds. Utilizing multiple natural populations over 2 years, we investigated reproductive modes of individuals from bagged and unbagged treatments of each species. We found that L. cuneata produced a mean of five times as many seeds and a significantly greater number of vegetative buds than any native studied, and over twenty times as many CH flowers. Insect visitation significantly affected seed set in CH flowers, though some autonomous CH selfing occurred in all species. The invasive relied relatively less on selfing than the natives and exhibited less variation in reproductive output from both modes of reproduction. We conclude that the diverse reproductive biology and wide regeneration niche of L. cuneata in relation to its native congeners confer a fitness homeostasis that facilitates the successful spread of this invasive under a wide range of conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Cleistogamy; Fitness homeostasis; Invasive; Lespedeza; Pollination; Propagule production; Regeneration niche; Tallgrass prairie,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349479874

It remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an incompatible species may impose a ""biological stress"" even in the absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked. Results. We report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, Oryza sativa L. and Oenothera biennis L. The mutator-phenotype (named Tong211-LP) showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged panicles. Expectably, gel-blotting by total genomic DNA of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression. Characterization of Tong211-LP (S0) and its selfed progenies (S1) ruled out contamination (via seed or pollen) or polyploidy as a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized transposable elements (TEs), including a MITE (mPing), and three LTR retrotransposons (Osr7, Osr23 and Tos17). AFLP and MSAP fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic variation in Tong211-LP and its immediate progenies. mPing mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration detected by MSAP but not with genetic variation detected by AFLP. Assay by q-RT-PCR of the steady-state transcript abundance of a set of genes encoding for the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, and small interference RNA (siRNA) pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in expression of 12 out of the 13 genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies. Conclusion. Transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated TE activity occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of O. biennis. Heritably perturbed homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome merger or genetic introgression. © 2009 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650106508

One important factor that may direct the evolution of floral signals is a pollinator's ability to learn. When animals learn to associate two similar signals with different outcomes, biases in their responses to new signals can be formed. Here, we investigated whether or not pollinators develop learned biases towards floral scents that depend on nectar reward quality by training restrained honeybees to learn to associate two similar odour signals with different outcomes using a classical conditioning assay. Honeybees developed learned biases towards odours as a result of differential conditioning, and the extent to which an olfactory bias could be produced depended upon the difference in the quality of the nectar rewards experienced during conditioning. Our results suggest that differences in reward quality offered by flowers influence odour recognition by pollinators, which in turn could influence the evolution of floral scents in natural populations of co-flowering plants. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Floral scent; Honeybee; Olfaction; Peak shift; Pollinator; Sensory bias,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650493338

However, success has been limited mainly due to lack of maize genotypes that show clear differences in response to well defined moisture deficit condition. Two sets of drought tolerant (DT) maize germplasm were evaluated under screenhouse and field conditions between 1999 and 2002. In the screenhouse study, performances of the genotypes were compared under well-watered condition and moisture deficit imposed at different growth stages. Under field conditions, the first set comprising 11 accessions along with a check were evaluated for 4 growing seasons while the second set which comprised 3 DT varieties were evaluated along with 2 check varieties using monthly plantings between April and August of 2001 and 2002, respectively. In the first set, post anthesis moisture deficit significantly reduced grain yield by 25 to 73.5% in the open pollinated varieties (OPVs) and by 20 to 64% in the hybrids. Grain yield under field conditions ranged from 2.48 to 3.49, 2.82 to 3.73 and 3.58 to 4.76 tons/ha-1 for 1999, 2000 and 2001 full growing seasons, respectively, and 2.03 to 2.50 tons/ha-1 for 2000 late growing season. In the second set, pre and post anthesis moisture deficits reduced grain yield by 77.6 and 95.8%, respectively, of well watered condition while in the field, grain yields in the genotypes were highest for plantings made in April and July (1.90 - 2.5 t/ha), lowest for August (0.7 -1.8 t/ha) when moisture deficit coincided with reproductive phase. Yield stability exhibited under moisture deficit and on the field by 8522-2, Oba super 2 and AK9943-DMRSR in the first set as well as DT-SR-Y C0 and DT-SR-W C0 in the second set, indicates their suitability either as cultivars per se or as potential source of DT alleles for development of DT maize varieties for Nigeria's savanna ecologies. © 2009 Academic Journals.",Drought tolerance; Germplasm accessions; Grain yield; Moisture deficit; Planting dates,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949147567

We focus on the invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems: Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not affected at least in one of the islands.

Complementary sex determination (CSD) in Hymenoptera may impose a substantial genetic load through the production of inviable or sterile diploid males. Modelling and laboratory studies have indicated that this genetic load may trigger a 'diploid male vortex' leading to rapid extinction of populations. Here we take a broader theoretical approach to analyze why populations exhibiting CSD persist in nature, even if they contain large proportions of homozygous diploid individuals. Using an individual-based model of spatially structured hymenopteran populations, we show that (i) inviability or reduced fertility of homozygous individuals, (ii) female-biased sex ratio, and (iii) strong intra-specific competition can mitigate the negative influence of CSD on population persistence and that (iv) already extremely low dispersal rates will result in long term survival. These findings underline the importance of life history traits for population survival and demonstrate that rather specific conditions must be met to initiate the 'diploid male vortex'. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Snowmelt occurs earlier, but is decoupled from seasonal warming. Climate warming advances the timing of snowmelt and early season phenological events (e.g., the onset of greening and flowering); however, earlier snowmelt without warmer temperatures may have a different effect on phenology. Here, we report the results of a set of snowmelt manipulations in which radiation-absorbing fabric and the addition and removal of dust from the surface of the snowpack advanced or delayed snowmelt in the alpine tundra. These changes in the timing of snowmelt were superimposed on a system where the timing of snowmelt varies with topography and has been affected by increased dust loading. At the community level, phenology exhibited a threshold response to the timing of snowmelt. Greening and flowering were delayed before seasonal warming, after which there was a linear relationship between the date of snowmelt and the timing of phenological events. Consequently, the effects of earlier snowmelt on phenology differed in relation to topography, which resulted in increasing synchronicity in phenology across the alpine landscape with increasingly earlier snowmelt. The consequences of earlier snowmelt from increased dust deposition differ from climate warming and include delayed phenology, leading to synchronized growth and flowering across the landscape and the opportunity for altered species interactions, landscape-scale gene flow via pollination, and nutrient cycling.",Climate warming; Phenology; Plant life history; Synchronization; Threshold,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650882749

The new strategy builds on the existing base for P. radiata, and on the last strategy review in 2000. The new strategy comprises a large open-pollinated (OP) Main Population (MP) with 500 female parents and two sublines (250 female parents per subline). The MP will be tested using alpha designs, single-tree plots and incomplete blocks to maximise efficiency. Each subline will be tested on four sites, geographically distant from the other subline. The MP will be managed in discrete generations. Selection of the next generation will be using a combination of backward and forward selection, but the strict control of inbreeding with identified lineage will rely on the development of parental reconstruction for OP progeny. There are alternatives to this, however, such as estimating the group coancestry and accepting some additional increase in inbreeding. This is a new and significant departure from previous breeding strategies for P. radiata in New Zealand. There will also be a single, small Elite Population (EP), tested 50% as progeny and 50% as clones. Twenty four parents will be tested each year as clones and 24 as seedling progeny with some overlap between the two. It is expected that the clonal population will capture the greatest gains in traits with low heritabilities, and the half-sib progeny will capture the greatest gains in traits with high heritabilities. The two sublines will be maintained in the EP, and breeding will be managed as a rolling front with trials established every year, while trials of the MP will be established every 10 years.",Australia; Clones; Genetic gain; Mating system; Sublining,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649700854

Post-pollination mechanisms might determine the seed siring success of different pollen donors within species as well as the chances for hybridization between species. Nicotiana longiflora and N. plumbaginifolia occur in sympatry in Northwest Argentina, where they have overlapping flowering seasons and share floral visitors. We explored (1) pollen tube growth rates for outcross versus self pollen in single-donor pollinations; (2) siring success of self versus outcross pollen donors in competitive pollinations, and (3) possibilities for hybridization by performing two- (outcross conspecific vs. heterospecific) and three-pollen donor (self vs. outcross vs. heterospecific) crosses. In N. longiflora, both pollen tube growth rate and siring success favored outcross pollen over self pollen and strong rejection of heterospecific pollen. In N. plumbaginifolia, pollen tube growth rate was similar for self and outcross pollen, self pollen sired similar numbers of offspring than outcross pollen and heterospecific pollen sired roughly the same number of progeny than self pollen. Results suggest that in natural sympatric populations, interspecific crosses would likely lead to unidirectional hybridization with N. plumbaginifolia as the seed parent. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Competitive pollinations; Cryptic self-incompatibility; Paternity success; Sympatry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349984566

A field study was carried out, including observations of the morphology and biology of the flowers, insect visits and pollinator behaviour. We also evaluated seed set, seed germination and seedling development for different pollination modes. Although seeds were produced by self-pollination, pollination by small insects contributed most effectively to the reproductive success of S. elegans, resulting in the greatest seed set, with the highest germination percentage and optimum seedling vigour.

The average length of the flowering season was 45 days ranging from 18 days for 'Harvest' to 50 days for 'Fuerte'. The earliest genotypes to flower were 'Fuerte' and 'Shepard' that started blooming during the third week of March. The latest genotypes to flower were 'Colin V-33', 'Adi', 'OA184' and 'Harvest', which started blooming in the second week of April. 'Hass' blooming lasted 30 days, from the first week of April until the second week of May.

Typically, these invaders have entomophilous flowers which are visited by a diverse array of pollinators. The type of breeding system and the role that pollination services play in the reproductive success of invasive plants have, however, received little attention. We studied the breeding system and pollen limitation of two entomophilous invasive plants, Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta, in different Mediterranean coastal localities in north-eastern Spain. Both species are, to some degree self-compatible; however, because of frequent visitation, open pollination increased the seed set in both species by at least 50%. Whereas O. stricta showed no pollen limitation, some populations of C. aff. acinaciformis had a lower seed set in open-pollinated flowers than in flowers where supplementary hand-pollination ensured out-crossing. This local pollen limitation in C. aff. acinaciformis could be due to the low efficiency of its visitors (mainly beetles) or its hybrid status. On the basis of previous studies on Carpobrotus sp. hybrid complexes, we suggest that the variability among sites in the seed set of open-pollinated flowers is caused by different degrees of hybrid introgression. Not withstanding, we found the C. aff. acinaciformis seed sets studied were higher than those reported in other regions.

We compiled P : O ratios and outcrossing rates for 107 angiosperm species and analyzed the relation between these traits considering pollination mode, life form and phylogenetic relatedness among species. In general, P : O ratios correlated significantly with outcrossing rates. However, when taking additional factors into account, the relation became ambiguous. The correlation was significantly positive in wind-pollinated species, but only marginally so in animal-pollinated species. Wind-pollinated species had higher P : O ratios than animal-pollinated taxa. In woody perennials, outcrossing was the predominant mating system and outcrossing rates did not correlate with P : O ratios. The results were not altered by accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. The results indicate that P : O ratios vary more strongly with pollination mode and life form than with the mating system. © 2009 New Phytologist Trust.",Biotic pollination; Comparative method; Life form; Mating system; Outcrossing rate; P : O ratios; Phylogeny; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649460924

Degree distribution, nestedness, and expected species persistence were evaluated. In addition, we assessed the roles of predefined subsets of plants (classified by life forms) and pollinators (grouped by taxonomic orders) in the network's structure and dynamics. For this, we simulated the complete removal of each plant and pollinator subset and analyzed the resultant connectivity patterns, as well as the expected long-term species losses by running a stochastic model. Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the network structure to the loss of single species in order to identify potential targets for conservation. Our results show that the plant-pollinator network of this Chilean temperate rain forest exhibits a nested structure of interactions, with a degree distribution best described by a power law model. Model simulations revealed the importance of trees and hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall species persistence. The hymenopterans Bombus dahlbomii and Diphaglossa gayi, the shrubs Tepualia stipularis and Ugni molinae, the vines Mitraria coccinea and Asteranthera ovata, and the entire set of tree species exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation of network structure and should be considered as focal species for conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and habitat loss. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Degree distribution; Mutualistic networks; Nestedness; Network dynamics; Pollination web,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649213987

In Monteverde, hummingbird-pollinated plants are generally pollen-limited and incapable of autonomous self-pollination. However, many hummingbird-pollinated plants in the Bromeliaceae are capable of autonomous selfpollination. We examined the breeding system and pollination of Pitcairnia brittoniana (Mez), shown previously to be capable of autonomous selfing. We found that fruit and seed set were high in open-, self-, and cross-pollinated treatments, as well as in the autonomous self-pollination treatment. Seed set, but not fruit set was slightly lower among pollinator-excluded flowers from which the anthers or stigma were removed at dawn, the time at which flowers are first receptive to cross-pollination, relative to controls whose anthers and stigmas were unmanipulated. Flowers were visited by two hummingbird species that deposited cumulative cross-pollen loads sufficient for near maximum seed set. Therefore, P. brittoniana has the potential for high levels of either outcrossing or inbreeding in Monteverde. Although the relative competitive abilities of self-and cross-pollen in P. brittoniana are unknown, cross-pollen prepotency is probable. Pitcairnia brittoniana likely maintains a mixed mating system, outcrossing when hummingbirds are active and selfing autonomously when they are scarce.",Autonomous self-pollination; Bromeliad; Hummingbird pollination; Tropical cloud forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350786226

Displacement of flowering times between reproductively isolated species reduces competition for pollinators and the formation of inviable hybrid seeds. Under strong pollen limitation, competition for pollinators causes rapid evolution of allochronic isolation both for hybridizing and nonhybridizing species. Under weak pollen limitation, allochronic isolation evolves rapidly for hybridizing species but more slowly for nonhybridizing species. Positive density-dependent pollinator visitation rate at low flower densities facilitates allochronic isolation under weak pollen limitation.

I present analytical and simulation models to investigate how pollinator constancy and pollen carryover interact with each other and with the relationship between pollen receipt and seed set to determine pollination success in competitive environments. With inconstant pollinators, increased pollen carryover reduces variance in pollen receipt without affecting average pollen receipt. Consequently, for flowers requiring at least a threshold quantity of pollen for success, rare flowers with inconstant pollinators benefit from reduced carryover, especially for high pollen receipt thresholds, whereas common flowers benefit from increased carryover, especially for low receipt thresholds. Pollinator constancy is predicted to increase pollen receipt, especially if pollen carryover rates are low. As a result, increased pollinator constancy reduces the range of pollen receipt thresholds for which carryover is beneficial. Similarly, for flowers whose pollination success is a convex function of pollen receipt, carryover is expected to increase fecundity if pollinators are inconstant, but with even a low degree of pollinator constancy, carryover reduces fecundity. These results predict that rare plants with many ovules per flower benefit from dispersing aggregations of pollen, especially if their pollinators exhibit constancy, whereas plants with inconstant pollinators and low thresholds of pollen receipt benefit from pollen grains dispersing individually to increase the number of flowers reached by the pollen. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649562830

To date research in this area has focused on how invasive plant species affect pollinator behaviour, but there is a lack of data on the impact that alien plant species have on wild pollinator populations. Since their introduction in the 19th century, and rapid spread after the 1950s, alien goldenrods (Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea) have been among the most successful invasive plant species in Europe. We studied the effects of goldenrods on wild pollinator communities in SE Poland. The abundance, species richness and diversity of wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies were compared between wet meadows invaded by goldenrod (10 transects) and non-invaded controls (10 transects). Furthermore, we compared the plant diversity and average cover between the two groups of sites. Invasion of goldenrods had a very strong negative effect on wild pollinator diversity as well as abundance. Plant diversity and average cover were also negatively affected by goldenrod invasion. Wild pollinators were grouped according to their nesting and food specialization, but none were resistant to the invasion, indicating that introduced goldenrod may affect the entire wild pollinator community. Our study emphasises the urgent need to develop specific protection plans for wild pollinators in habitats threatened by foreign plants and we call for the introduction of programs to stop the invasion of goldenrod not only in Poland, but also on a continental scale. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the large potential influence of such interactions on plant community structure, biodiversity and evolutionary processes, we know surprisingly little about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions among plant species for pollinator attraction. Therefore, we explored the relationships between conspecific and heterospecific floral densities and the flower visitation rates of nine plant species mainly visited by bumble bees, and six plant species mainly visited by flies, in a temperate grassland, through stepwise multiple regressions. Significant relationships were interpreted as interactions for pollinator attraction. Our results revealed that positive intra- and interspecific interactions for pollinator attraction were far more frequent than negative ones. Seventeen interspecific interactions were revealed of which 14 were significantly positive, whereas three of four significant intraspecific interactions were positive. Seven species experienced only positive interactions and two species experienced only negative interactions. The results presented here indicate that negative interactions are not necessarily the dominant ecological interaction for pollination among plants within a community, and the study represents a straightforward approach to study intra- and interspecific interactions among multiple species within a community. We discuss which mechanisms may drive the positive interactions for pollinator attraction and whether this may result in facilitative effects on reproductive success. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Coexistence; Competition; Facilitation; Floral market; Joint attraction; Magnet-species; Multi-species; Pollination interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951093322

This paper presents evidence that staminodization in the upper half is associated with a severe retardation of the entire upper floral hemisphere early in development. Possible consequences of this developmental retardation are seen also in the gynoecium, where the upper carpel of the three-carpellate ovary is underdeveloped and sterile at maturity. Only late in development do the upper petals and staminodes expand and acquire pigments necessary for their attractive function. We surmise that retardations of this severity are unlikely to be found for functionally fertile organs such as stamens and ovule-producing carpels, because key preparatory events preceding sporogenesis might otherwise be disrupted. Such differential growth about the floral apex resembles that known in some eudicots to be regulated by the TCP gene family; thus, future molecular developmental studies in Commelina may help to extend our understanding of the evolutionary genetics of floral monosymmetry to monocots.",Commelina; Commelinaceae; Congenital fusion of sepals; Dayflower; Floral development; Floral monosymmetry; Pollinator deception; Staminode development; Staminodization; TCP gene family,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249221468

Empirical support to this prediction has come mostly from specialist interactions. In contrast, local adaptation is considered highly unlikely in generalist interactions. In this study, we experimentally test local adaptation in a generalist plant-pollinator geographic mosaic, by means of a transplant experiment in which plants coming from two evolutionary hotspots and two coldspots were offered to pollinators at the same four localities. Plants produced in the hotspots attracted more pollinators in all populations, whereas coldspot plants attracted fewer pollinators in all populations.

For plants dispersing in linear habitats, one of these critical processes is the maintenance of adequate pollen transfer to insure seed production within the corridor. This study focuses on a common, self-incompatible forest herb, Trillium grandiflorum, to assess plant-pollinator interactions and the influence of spatial processes on plant reproduction in hedgerow corridors compared to forests. First, using pollen supplementation experiments over 2 years, we quantified the extent of pollen limitation in both habitats, testing the prediction of greater limitation in small hedgerow populations than in forests. While pollen limitation of fruit and seed set was common, its magnitude did not differ between habitats. Variations among sites, however, suggested an influence of landscape context on pollination services. Second, we examined the effect of isolation on plant reproduction by monitoring fruit and seed production, as well as pollinator activity and assemblage, in small flower arrays transplanted in hedgerows at increasing distances from forest and from each other. We detected no difference in the proportion of flowers setting fruit or in pollinator activity with isolation, but we observed some differences in pollinator assemblages. Seed set, on the other hand, declined significantly with increasing isolation in the second year of the study, but not in the first year, suggesting altered pollen transfer with distance. Overall, plants in hedgerow corridors and forests benefited from similar pollination services. In this system, plant-pollinator interactions and reproduction seem to be influenced more by variations in resource distribution over years and landscapes than by local habitat conditions. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Functional connectivity; Habitat corridor; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pollen limitation; Trillium grandiflorum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649236188

Yet little evidence exists on their relative contribution, despite the importance of viable seed production to population dynamics. To study how variation in female reproductive success is affected by the quantity versus the diversity of surrounding mates contributing pollen, we integrated pollination experiments, data on natural seed set and seed viability, and AFLP genetic marker data in the wind-pollinated dioecious clonal forest herb Mercurialis perennis. Pollination experiments indicated weak quantitative pollen limitation effects on seed set. Among-population crosses showed reduced seed viability, suggesting outbreeding depression due to genetic divergence. Pollination with pollen from a single source did not negatively affect reproductive success. These findings were consistent with results of the survey of natural female reproductive success. Seed set decreased with the distance to males in a female plants' local neighborhood, suggesting a shortage of pollen in isolated female plants, and increased with the degree of local genetic diversity. Spatial isolation to other populations and population size did not affect seed set. None of these variables were related to seed viability. We conclude that pollen movement in M. perennis is likely very limited.

We studied the correlates of flower trait variation in populations of a style-dimorphic plant, Narcissus papyraceus Ker-Gawl., within a region of high biogeographical significance, the Strait of Gibraltar. This species shows a geographic gradient in the style-morph ratio, suggested to be driven by pollinator shifts. We tested whether parallel geographic variation of perianth traits also exists, concomitant with vegetative trait variation or genetic similarity of plant populations. Location The Strait of Gibraltar region (SG hereafter, including both south-western Iberian Peninsula and north-western Morocco). Methods We used univariate and multivariate analyses of flower and vegetative traits in 23 populations. We applied Mantel tests and partial Mantel correlations on vegetative and flower traits and geographic locations of populations to test for spatial effects. We used Moran's autocorrelation analyses to explore the spatial structure within the range, and performed the analyses with and without the Moroccan samples to test for the effects of the SG on spatial patterns. Amplified fragment length polymorphism data were used to estimate the genetic distance between populations and to ascertain its relationship with morphometric distance. Results There was high variation between and within populations in both flower and vegetative traits. Mantel correlations between geographic and morphometric distances were not significant, but the exclusion of Moroccan populations revealed some distance effect. Partial Mantel correlation did not detect a significant correlation between flower and vegetative morphometric distances after controlling for geographic distance. There were opposite trends in spatial autocorrelograms of flower and vegetative traits. The genetic distance between pairs of populations was directly correlated with geographic distance; however, flower morphometric and genetic distances were not significantly correlated. Main conclusions The SG had some influence on phenotypes, although the causes remain to be determined. The opposite trend of variation in flower and vegetative traits, and the lack of correlation between genetic distance and dissimilarity of flower phenotypes favour the hypothesis of pollinator-mediated selection on flower morphology, although this may affect only particular traits and populations rather than overall phenotypes. Although stochastic population processes may have a small effect, other factors may account for the high flower variation within and between populations. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",AFLP; Ecogeography; Ecotypic differentiation; Flower biology; Genetic distance; Morphometry; Pollinators; Spatial autocorrelation; Strait of Gibraltar; Style dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649198709

We studied the diversity of bee species visiting indigenous tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) and habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense) in subtropical Yucatán, México. The contribution of two native bees, Exomalopsis (E) and Augochloropsis (AG) was compared with that of the introduced Africanized Apis mellífera (HB) for pollinating unvisited flowers in both crops. Apis mellífera and stingless bees were dominant in habanero pepper but solitary bee species were important visitors of tomato. In spite of both crops being autogamic, there was a significant contribution of native bees for pollination of both tomato and habanero pepper. The comparison of fruit weight, number of seeds, and a pollination index based on the latter showed that E and AG were more effective pollinators compared to HB in both crops (ca. Spear's index of ca. 0.7 vs. 0.35 respectively). In tomato, a further evaluation of the contribution to pollination provided by the three bee species was made using the rate of visits to flowers. Although E and AG were the most efficient pollinators at single flower visits in tomato, none of the three species (including HB) were able to provide single visits to all flowers per unit time to the crop. Our results underline the importance of maintaining diverse assemblages and abundant populations of bee species that can synergically contribute to the productivity of tomato and hot pepper in the Neotropics. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",Augochloropsis; Bee conservation; Exomalopsis; Hot pepper; Tomato; Yucatan península,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67249138799

Using a conventional and a phylogenetically controlled meta-analytical approach on a data set of 40 studies, we evaluated the effect of alien neighbour plant species (aliens) on visitation to and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species (focals), and compared such effect to that of native neighbours (natives). An overall significantly negative effect of aliens on visitation to and reproduction of focals was confirmed. Interestingly, aliens differed from natives in their effect on visitation, but not on reproductive success. The negative effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success increased at high relative alien plant abundance, but this increase was proportionally lower than the increase in relative plant abundance. Likewise, effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success was most detrimental when alien and focal species had similar flower symmetry or colour. The phylogenetic relatedness between alien neighbours and focals influenced the reproductive success effect size. Results of the phylogenetic meta-analysis were only partly consistent with those of the conventional meta-analysis, depending on the response variable and on whether we controlled for the phylogeny of neighbour or focal species, which calls for special attention to control for species relatedness in this type of review.

To understand the evolutionary significance of this unique process of pollen transfer, comparative morphological and ecological studies were conducted in Gabon.  Methods: During a total stay of 11 months, 31 species of Marantaceae were investigated at different sites in Gabon. The study included analyses of floral diversity, observations on the pollinator spectrum as well as ecological measurements (e.g. nectar sugar concentration and volume).  Key Results: Analyses reveal five flower types based on flower size and pigmentation, spatial arrangement of the floral tube and presence/absence of nectar guides and conspicuous outer staminodes. Each type is associated with a specific functional pollinator group leading to the description of distinct pollination syndromes. The 'small (horizontal)' flowers are predominantly pollinated by small bees (Thrinchostoma spp., Allodapula ornaticeps), the 'large (horizontal)' and 'medium-sized (horizontal)' flowers by medium-sized bees (Amegilla vivida, Thrinchostoma bicometes), the 'locked (horizontal)' flowers by large bees (Xylocopa nigrita, X. varipes) and the '(large) vertical' flowers by sunbirds.  Conclusions: The longevity of Marantaceae individuals and the omnipresence of their pollinators allowed the specialization to a given functional pollinator group. Intermediate ecological values, however, make occasional pollinator overlaps possible, indicating potential pathways of pollinator shifts. Similar radiation tendencies observed on other continents hint at similar selective pressures and evolutionary constraints. © The Author 2009.

We performed resource (water and nutrients) and pollination (open and supplemental) treatments on two species of flowering plants, Ipomopsis aggregata and Linum lewisii, that differed in life-history, and we measured how resource addition affected floral characters, pollination, and reproduction (both male and female function). We separated the direct effects of resources versus indirect effects on female function via changes in pollination using a factorial experiment and path analysis. Resource addition affected I. aggregata and L. lewisii differently. Ipomopsis aggregata, a monocarp, responded to fertilization in the year of treatment application, increasing flower production, bloom duration, corolla width, nectar production, aboveground biomass, and pollen receipt relative to control plants. Fertilization also increased total seed production per plant, and hand-pollination increased seeds per fruit in I. aggregata, indicating some degree of pollen limitation of seed production. In contrast, fertilization had no effect on growth or reproductive output in the year of treatment on L. lewisii, a perennial, except that fertilization lengthened bloom duration. However, delayed effects of fertilization were seen in the year following treatment, with fertilized plants having greater aboveground biomass, seeds per fruit, and seeds per plant than control plants. In both species, there were no effects of resource addition on male function, and the direct effects of fertilization on female function were relatively stronger than the indirect effects via changes in pollination. Although we studied only two plant species, our results suggest that life-history traits may play an important role in determining the reproductive responses of plants to soil nutrient and pollen additions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Floral traits; Life-history; Nutrient limitation; Plant reproduction; Pollen limitation; Water addition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67849108203

The present study used three populations of C. aconitifolius, each one located in a different site in Yucatán (México): pasture, deciduous forest and subdeciduous medium height forest and three levels of defoliation: 50 percent, 100 percent, and a control (no damage). Results showed that defoliation reduced significantly the total number of male flowers produced in two of the sites. Defoliation did not impact female flower production or the proportion of female flowers produced. Finally, floral visit rates were not affected by defoliation via changes in sexual expression and neither by site or by the interaction site × defoliation.

Some verbal models hypothesize that the ability to self-fertilize may be associated with high dispersal, since completely outcrossing species cannot reproduce when they disperse to an empty destination site. However, empirical observations fail to support a clear trend, and an association of high colonizing ability with high outcrossing has been reported. Here we develop a general metapopulation model for the joint evolution of seed dispersal and self-fertilization when local pollen limitation varies stochastically over time. Under these assumptions, we study how dispersal and mating system influence each other through selection. We predict the existence of two consistent syndromes of traits: dispersing outcrossers and nondispersing (partial) selfers. These theoretical expectations contradict the classical view and shed new light on an old problem, allowing us to reinterpret empirical data. Finally, our predictions are discussed in light of empirical data concerning the association of seed dispersal mechanism and breeding system. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Dispersal; Evolutionarily stable strategy model; Joint evolution; Mating system; Syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66849132727

Because they found granular structure both in other seed plants (non-saccate conifers, Gnetales) and in angiosperms (some Magnoliales, monocots, and ""Amentiferae""), they suggested it might be ancestral in angiosperms. This suggestion was elaborated by other workers and supported by studies of Le Thomas and Lugardon on Annonaceae (Magnoliales), which appeared to show origin of columellae by various modifications of granules. Phylogenetic (cladistic) analyses of seed plants based on morphological and molecular data modify this scheme considerably but reaffirm the systematic interest of granular structure. In conifers and Gnetales (which probably form a clade), granular structure appears to be derived from alveolar (as in Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae and extinct outgroups of conifers). Molecular analyses root the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms among Amborella, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales, which have columellar and related exine structures, implying that granular exines were derived within angiosperms. This contradicts earlier views that granular structure provides evidence for a relationship between angiosperms and outgroups such as Gnetales and Bennettitales. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that granular structure was derived from columellar within Magnoliales and Laurales, in each of which it is an important synapomorphy of a major subgroup; the same may also be true for Fagales. However, phylogenetic analyses of Annonaceae confirm that granular structure is ancestral in this group and columellar is derived, essentially as a reversal to the ancestral state in angiosperms. In Fagales granular structure is associated with wind pollination, but not in Magnoliales and Laurales; however, in all three cases it may be correlated with reduction in exine thickness. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Only 25% of progenies distributed from BSG corresponded to F1 hybrids combinations originally planned to be released.

Complex zygomorphic flowers tend to be oriented horizontally. It is hypothesized that a horizontal flower orientation ensures effective pollen transfer by facilitating pollinator recognition (the recognition-facilitation hypothesis) and/or pollinator landing (the landing-control hypothesis). To examine these two hypotheses, we altered the angle of Commelina communis flowers and examined the efficiency of pollen transfer, as well as the behavior of their visitors. We exposed unmanipulated (horizontal-), upward-, and downward-facing flowers to syrphid flies (mostly Episyrphus balteatus), which are natural visitors to C. communis. The frequency of pollinator approaches and landings, as well as the amount of pollen deposited by E. balteatus, decreased for the downward-facing flowers, supporting both hypotheses. The upward-facing flowers received the same numbers of approaches and landings as the unmanipulated flowers, but experienced more illegitimate landings. In addition, the visitors failed to touch the stigmas or anthers on the upward-facing flowers, leading to reduced pollen export and receipt, and supporting the landing-control hypothesis. Collectively, our data suggested that the horizontal orientation of zygomorphic flowers enhances pollen transfer by both facilitating pollinator recognition and controlling pollinator landing position. These findings suggest that zygomorphic flowers which deviate from a horizontal orientation may have lower fitness because of decreased pollen transfer. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Commelina communis; Flower orientation; Horizontal; Pollinator specialization; Zygomorphic flower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649159249

Bertya ingramii, a monoecious, wind-pollinated shrub, is restricted to three populations in a 4 km2 area in eastern Australia. Populations are separated by deeply dissected gorges where it is unlikely that seeds are exchanged but where wind movement may facilitate pollen dispersal. Using 156 highly polymorphic ISSR markers, we found moderate genetic variation within and among populations of B. ingramii and less genetic diversity in a nearby and small population of the widespread Bertya rosmarinifolia. The smallest population of B. ingramii (&lt;30 plants) had the highest genetic variation (65% polymorphic markers, Shannon Information Index = 0.30). AMOVA and a Bayesian analysis showed that molecular variance was equally distributed within and among populations suggesting that gene flow is as limited within as in among populations. Genetic distances between populations were only weakly explained by their relative geographic distances (mantel test, R2 = 0.21, P = 0.001) but the distribution of private bands, the departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and a UPGMA tree showed that the smallest population of B. ingramii was generally more similar to an upstream population of B. rosmarinifolia. Thirty-eight percent of bands in this small population of B. ingramii were exclusively shared with B. rosmarinifolia. This covert hybridisation may have been an ancient event but may be responsible for contemporary declines in germination and establishment in B. ingramii. The conservation implications are amplified by the endangered status of B. ingramii.

This is apparently the first such analysis for any Cyclopogon species, and one of very few studies in which both odour and osmophore are characterised in a nectar-rewarding orchid. Structures responsible for floral scent production were localised with neutral red staining and histochemical assays for lipids and starch. Their morphology and anatomy were studied with scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy thin sections, respectively. Fragrance samples were collected using SPME fibres and analysed with GC-MS. Anatomical evidence suggests that two parallel oval-shaped patches of unicellular trichomes on the abaxial surface of the labellum are osmophores. These are rich in stored lipids, while the parenchyma surrounding the vascular bundles contains starch. Only freshly opened flowers produced odours, while buds and withered flowers lacked scent. The chemical composition of the odour was dominated (>99.8%) by a single compound, trans-4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT). Gland anatomy and position on the outside of the perianth are unusual for scent glands in general. The presence of DMNT, a nearly ubiquitous compound in herbivore-induced vegetative emissions and one of the major floral volatiles of Yucca, is not surprising in view of hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of flower scents, suggesting that wound volatiles are utilised as kairomonal attractants by florivores whose activities result in pollination. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","DMNT; Floral scent; GC-MS; Halictidae; Osmophore; Pollinator attraction; Trans-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650445585

Unfortunately, no study has explored the genetic variation of flower shape, despite that this information is crucial to understand its adaptive evolution. Our main goal here is to determine heritability of corolla shape in Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). Also, we explore heritability of other pollinator-selected traits in this plant species, such as plant size, flower display, and corolla size. In addition, we investigate genetic correlations between all these traits. We found significant heritability for one plant-size trait (stalk height), for number of flowers, for all corolla-size traits (corolla diameter, corolla tube length and corolla tube width), and for corolla shape. Consequently, this species retains a high ability to respond to the selection exerted by its pollinators. Genetic correlation was strong between all functionally related traits and between flower number and plant size, weak between corolla size and plant size and no correlation between corolla shape and any other trait. Thus, selection affecting some E. mediohispanicum traits would also indirectly affect other functionally related and unrelated traits. More importantly, the observed genetic correlation seems to be at least partially adaptive because positive correlational selection currently acts on the covariance between some of these traits (Gómez 2003; Gómez et al. 2006). © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Corolla shape heritability; Erysimum mediohispanicum; Genetic correlation; Geometric morphometrics; Phenotypic integration; Rassicaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66749157308

At equilibrium, plants should show no response to experimental pollen supplementation because resources limit seed set above the current level of pollen attraction, while experimental reduction in pollen deposition below the equilibrium level would reduce seed set. The predicted equilibrium may be disrupted, however, if plants expend additional energy to replenish removed nectar. We investigated the combined effects of nectar removal and pollen delivery on female reproductive success of Penstemon roseus (Plantaginaceae), a hummingbird-pollinated plant that replenishes removed nectar. We first documented that the frequency of experimental nectar removal was correlated with total nectar secretion; and increased frequency of nectar removal resulted in increased female reproductive costs to the plant. Trade-offs between investing resources in nectar and investing resources in seeds were then investigated in two contrasting natural populations by removing nectar from flowers at increasing frequencies while simultaneously hand-pollinating flowers with increasing amounts of pollen. Seed set was lowest at low levels of pollen deposition, highest at medium-sized pollen loads, and intermediate when pollen loads were highest. At both sites, the frequency of nectar removal and pollen deposition had an interactive effect on seed production, in that intermediate levels of nectar removal result in the absolute highest seed set, but only at intermediate pollen loads. At high pollen loads, seed set was higher following little to no nectar removal, and at low pollen loads, all rates of nectar removal affected fecundity equally. Seed mass responded to nectar removal and pollination differently than did seed set. High levels of nectar removal and pollen delivery both lowered seed mass, with little interaction between main effects. Our findings are among the first to demonstrate that nectar replenishment costs and pollination intensity jointly affect seed production.

In contrast, the sexual individuals do not fertilize apomictic plants which produce seeds without fertilization of the egg cells. This unidirectional introgressive hybridization is expected finally to replace sexuality by apomixis and is thought to be a causal factor for the wide geographical distribution of apomictic complexes. Nevertheless, this process may be inhibited by induced selfing (mentor effects) of otherwise self-incompatible sexual individuals. Here whether mentor effects or actual cross-fertilization takes place between diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic cytotypes in the Ranunculus auricomus complex was tested via experimental crosses.  Methods: Diploid sexual mother plants were pollinated with tetra- and hexaploid apomictic pollen donators by hand, and the amount of well-developed seed compared with aborted seed was evaluated. The reproductive pathways were assessed in the well-developed seed via flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS).  Key Results: The majority of seed was aborted; the well-developed seeds have resulted from both mentor effects and cross-fertilization at very low frequencies (1.3 and 1.6% of achenes, respectively). Pollination by 4x apomictic pollen plants results more frequently in cross-fertilization, whereas pollen from 6x plants more frequently induced mentor effects.  Conclusions: It is concluded that introgression of apomixis into sexual populations is limited by ploidy barriers in the R. auricomus complex, and to a minor extent by mentor effects. In mixed populations, sexuality cannot be replaced by apomixis because the higher fertility of sexual populations still compensates the low frequencies of potential introgression of apomixis. © 2009 The Author(s).",Apomixis; Crossing experiments; Evolution; Flow cytometry; Geographical parthenogenesis; Ranunculus auricomus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69149095648

Recently developed phylogenetic tools identify patterns associated with environmental filtering across whole communities. Here we introduce a novel method that allows the detection of traits involved in the environmental filtering of species from specific clades in specific habitat types. Our approach identifies nonindependent trait/habitat/clade (THC) associations and also provides a framework for detecting clearly defined two-way trait/ clade, trait/habitat, and clade/habitat associations. The THC method relies on exact binomial tests and differentiates THC associations resulting from a three-way interaction from those that are generated by one or more underlying significant two-way interactions. It can also detect THC associations for which there are no significant twoway associations (trait/habitat, trait/clade, clade/habitat). To illustrate the THC method, we examine plant pollination and dispersal traits from six habitat types in a fragmented Costa Rican landscape. Results suggest that these traits are not widely important for the environmental filtering of most clades in this landscape, but animal dispersal and insect pollination are involved in the filtering of monocots and the Piperaceae in rain forest understory. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Community assembly; Dispersal mechanisms; Environmental filtering, pollination mechanisms; Exact binomial test; Functional traits",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66849128560

In this article, we investigate floral scent in two extra-tropical genera of Annonaceae. We discuss floral scent in the context of differing pollination strategies in these genera, and compare their scent to that of a close tropical relative. Floral volatiles were collected for Annona glabra, Asimina and Deeringothamnus whole flowers and dissected floral organs, using a standardized static-headspace solid phase microextraction method. Scents were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and identified using known standards. The floral scents of these species are highly dynamic, varying between floral organs, sexual stages and species. Maroon-flowered species of Asimina produce 'yeasty' odors, dominated by fermentation volatiles and occasionally containing sulfurous or nitrogenous compounds. White-flowered species of Asimina and Deeringothamnus produce pleasant odors characterized by lilac compounds, benzenoids and hydrocarbons. Annona glabra produces a strong, fruity-acetonic scent dominated by 3-pentanyl acetate and 1,8-cineole. The fermented/decaying scents of maroon-flowered species of Asimina suggest mimicry-based pollination strategies similar to aroids and stapeliads, whereas the pleasant scents of white-flowered species of Asimina suggest honest, reward-based pollination strategies.

Paternitywas assigned for three early life stages (aborted fruit,mature seeds, and seedlings) of five adult trees. The rate of pollen immigration into the population was high (>40%). Significant heterogeneity in pollen allele frequencies was discovered among families but subsequently declined across life stages. Comparisons of parentage among the three life stages showed no significant differences in the number of progeny resulting from immigrant pollen, and, similarly, the average distance between mating pairs did not differ over time. Only selffertilized seeds exhibited a significant decline across life stages, indicating inbreeding depression due to elfpollination. Estimates of total and effective numbers of pollen donors were high, and we did not detect a selective advantage among paternal trees. High initial levels of pollen heterogeneity and the lack of evidence for selection among outcrossed seeds of pollen parents suggest that differences in male fitness at early life stages other than selffertilization are due to initial pollination success rather than the differential survival of progeny among fathers. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Fabaceae; Gene flow; Male reproductive success; Paternity; Platypodium elegans,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349187996

Here, I examine the strength of floral isolation and interspecific pollen-pistil barriers between an invasive apomictic, Taraxacum officinale, and the indigenous sexual alpine dandelion, Taraxacum ceratophorum. Experimental arrays of either native inflorescences or a mixture of native and exotic inflorescences were used to examine insect preference and to track movement of a pollen analog. Using hand-pollinations, conspecific and heterospecific pollen germination success on native stigmas was compared. To additionally test for interspecific pollen competition, T. ceratophorum plants received one of three possible hand-pollinations: control conspecific pollination, concomitant conspecific and heterospecific pollination (mixed), or conspecific pollen followed by heterospecific pollen 15 min later (staggered). Floral isolation was negligible as no insect preference was detected. On a presence/absence basis, florets on native inflorescences received slightly less pollen analog from heterospecific donors than from conspecific donors; however, the amount of dye particles transferred from either Taraxacum species to stigmas on recipient T. ceratophorum inflorescences was equivalent. In contrast to weak floral isolation, strong pollen germination and pollen competition barriers should reduce the potential for hybridization. Heterospecific T. officinale pollen exhibited reduced germination success on T. ceratophorum stigmas in comparison to conspecific pollen. Furthermore, a significant pollen-competition effect on the percentage of hybrid offspring was detected only when T. officinale preceded T. ceratophorum pollen by 15 min. This result indicates that conspecific pollen out-competes heterospecific pollen but further suggests that biotic and abiotic factors reducing pollen accrual rates may partially remove barriers to natural hybridization. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Floral isolation; Hybridization; Insect preference; Pollen competition; Pollen-pistil Interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349093961

(Primrose) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, ?oral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Primula vulgaris is a native perennial herb with a very wide distribution in the British Isles. In many lowland areas it is essentially a plant of woodlands and hedgerows, although in the west it can occur abundantly in grasslands and other communities such as heaths. In northern and western Britain and Ireland, it may be frequent in open and even exposed habitats. Its distribution is linked with soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. It is shade tolerant, but it ?owers most profusely in canopy gaps. 3. Primula vulgaris is a rosette hemicryptophyte that reproduces mainly through seeds. Vegetative spread is restricted and only occurs within very short distances from the mother plant through the production of lateral rosettes. Although individual rosettes may die, plants are relatively long-lived (life expectancy of a newborn individual: 48.3 years). The mean age at ?rst ?owering was 20 months. 4. Pollination is mainly by bumblebees and other bees, but other long-tongued pollinators including syrphids, bee-?ies and even butter?ies may be locally important. P. vulgaris is an obligate outbreeder, with two genetically determined self-incompatible morphs (pin and thrum). A third morph (homostyle or long homostyle), with a stigma like that of pin but anthers like that of thrum, has been found in Somerset and North Dorset. In years when pollinators are scarce, homostyles have higher reproductive success than pins and thrums, suggesting that reproductive assurance could have had a profound effect on the evolution of homostyly in P. vulgaris. 5. Seeds are dispersed by ants and rodents. Dispersal is usually restricted to a few centimetres or decimetres from maternal plants, resulting in signi?cant ?ne-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. Pollen ?ow, on the other hand, is more extensive, but still limited to a few metres from paternal plants. 6. Populations of P. vulgaris have not changed markedly during the last century in most parts of Britain and Ireland and it is not threatened with extinction nationally.

Moreover, an emanating effect of nectar production on pollinator visits may occur, i.e. many pollinator visits may be observed around high nectar patches. Consequently, gene flow within patches of plants of high nectar production and their close neighbours may result in genetic structure. In this study, we investigated whether aggregation of total nectar production (nectar production per flower×number of flowers) and its emanating effect resulted in genetic structure in a natural E. vulgare population. We compared the spatial structure of total nectar production, pollinator visits and microsatellite markers using spatial autocorrelation analysis. Increased geitonogamy, caused by longer boutlengths in plants of high nectar production may generate genetic structure. We estimated selfing rates of plants of the highest and lowest total nectar production. Spatial aggregation of total nectar production occurred on a relatively small scale up to 2.83 m. A significant emanating correlation between total nectar production and pollinator visits was observed on a relatively large scale up to a 4.24 m. Thus, around patches of high nectar production numbers of pollinator visits were relatively high, while few visits were observed around patches of low nectar production. Weak genetic structure was present on a small scale up to 2.20 m. This corresponded with the scale of aggregation of total nectar production. High gene flow around the patches of high nectar production seems to weaken genetic structure. This is supported by the relatively low selfing rates. The average selfing rate of the plants of highest nectar production was 8.8% and that of the plants of lowest nectar production 5.0%. Low gene flow within and around low nectar patches sustain a weak genetic structure or, conversely, may have caused it in the first instance. Results indicate the importance of spatial structure of nectar production for pollinator movement. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Autocorrelation; Echium vulgare; Emanating correlation; Microsatellite markers; Nectar production; Pollinators; Selfing rates; Spatial distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67249084780

Many studies have investigated the relationship between conspecific density and pollen limitation among populations, but less is known about within-population relationships and the effect of heterospecific flower density. In addition, few studies have explicitly assessed how the spatial scales at which flowers are monitored affect relationships. We investigated the effect of floral neighborhood on pollen limitation at four spatial scales in the self-incompatible herbs Armeria maritima spp. maritima and Ranunculus acris spp. acris. Moreover, we measured pollen deposition in Armeria and pollinator visits to Ranunculus. There was substantial variation in pollen limitation among Armeria individuals, and 25% of this variation was explained by the density of compatible and heterospecific flowers within a 3 m circle. Deposition of compatible pollen was affected by the density of compatible and incompatible inflorescences within a 0.5 m circle, and deposition of heterospecific pollen was affected by the density of heterospecific flowers within a 2 m circle. In Ranunculus, the number of pollinator visits was affected by both conspecific and heterospecific flower densities. This did not, however, result in effects of the floral neighborhood on pollen limitation, probably due to an absence of pollen limitation at the population level. Our study shows that considerable variation in pollen limitation may occur among individuals of a population, and that this variation is partly explained by floral neighborhood density. Such individual-based measures provide an important link between pollen limitation theory, which predicts ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences for individual plants, and studies of the effects of landscape fragmentation on plant species persistence. Our study also highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales to understand the spatial extent of pollination processes within a population. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Competition; Facilitation; Flower density; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649213963

Principal component analysis of blossom volatiles demonstrated that there were three widely separated, tightly clustered groups which consisted of mandarin, lemon-lime and pummelo. Other cultivars of possible mixed parentage produced non-overlapping values within the boundaries of these three clustered groups. The first two Eigenvectors explained 83% of the total variance. Linalool, limonene and myrcene had the highest loading values. Those cultivars requiring insect pollination such as pummelo produced highest levels of total volatiles as well as highest levels of known honeybee stimulants such as 1-hexanol and linalool. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

When bees search for rewarding flowers, they use several visual cues to detect the available floral resources. In addition to these cues, bees can recognize scent marks, which are olfactory cues left on flowers foraged by previous visitors. This behavior is well known in social bees, such as honeybees and bumblebees. Although solitary bees do not need to give information about which flowers were foraged to conspecifics, several pieces of evidence have indicated the use of scent marks. However, it is unknown whether the behavior is widely used in many different bee species. We investigated whether four different solitary bees, Colletes patellatus (Colletidae), Andrena prostomias (Andrenidae), Osmia orientalis (Megachilidae), and Tetralonia mitsukurii (Apidae), can recognize flowers that have been foraged previously by visitors within 3 min. All four bees showed rejection responses to flowers foraged by conspecifics. However, our results showed that responses to foraged flowers varied among bee species. The tendency of A. prostomias and T. mitsukurii to reject the foraged flowers was pronounced, while in C. patellatus and O. orientalis it was weak. In both A. prostomias and T. mitsukurii, the rejection rate of flowers foraged by conspecifics decreased as the time lag after the last visit increased. Both bees visited the flowers from which pollen or nectar had been artificially removed. We suggest that A. prostomias and T. mitsukurii would recognize scent marks left by previous visitors, while the other two bees would not recognize them so strongly. It is likely that the decision to use scent marks is dependent either on the richness of resources or on the complexity of floral structure. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Floral resources; Foraging strategies; Rejection responses; Scent marks; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951093158

However, attention also needs be paid to the characteristics of host plants, which can potentially influence the consequences of nectar robbing as well. A system of three sympatric Corydalis species sharing the same nectar-robbing bumble-bee was therefore studied over 3 years in order to investigate the effect of nectar robbing on host reproductive fitness.  Methods: Three perennial species of Corydalis were studied in the Shennongjia Mountain area, central China. Observations were conducted on visitor behaviour and visitation frequencies of nectar-robbers and legitimate pollinators.  Key Results: The results indicated that the effect of nectar robbing by Bombus pyrosoma varied among species, and the three species had different mating systems. Seed set was thus influenced differentially: there was no effect on seed set of the predominantly selfing C. tomentella; for the facultative outcrossing C. incisa, nectar robbing by B. pyrosoma had a positive effect; and nectar robbing had a significant negative effect on the seed set of outcrossing C. ternatifolia.  Conclusions: A hypothesis is proposed that the type of host-plant mating system could influence the consequences of nectar robbing on host reproductive fitness. © The Author 2009.

Appropriate methods for controlling genetic relationships among individuals need to balance the concern of false positives and statistical power, which can vary for different association sample types. We used a series of simulated samples and empirical data sets from cross- and self-pollinated species to demonstrate the performance of several contemporary methods in correcting for different types of genetic relationships encountered in association analysis. We proposed a two-stage dimension determination approach for both principal component analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) to capture the major structure pattern in association mapping samples. Our results showed that by exploiting both genotypic and phenotypic information, this two-stage dimension determination approach balances the trade-off between data fit and model complexity, resulting in an effective reduction in false positive rate with minimum loss in statistical power. Further, the nMDS technique of correcting for genetic relationship proved to be a powerful complement to other existing methods. Our findings highlight the significance of appropriate application of different statistical methods for dealing with complex genetic relationships in various genomewide association studies.

One of the most important agricultural practices is mineral nutrition and soil fertility management that can improve yield and fruit quality of date palm. This research was conducted for a duration of three years to study the effect of essential nutrients application on Date Bunch Wilt and Dry disordr (DBWD) which has caused large production reductions in recent years. Two palm groves of ""Mordasang"" cultivar were chosen as experimental sites. One was afflicted with DBWD and the other one healthy. Fertilizer treatments were applied on the basis of soil and leaf analysis as follows: 1-Control (with no use of fertilizers) 2-Addition of balanced amounts of macro-nutrients and 3-Addition of balanced amounts of macro as well as micro-nutrients. The experiment was arranged with a complete randomized block design of five replications. Maintenance operations consisted of pollination, weeding, disease and pest control. Such plant responses as fruit yield, bunch number and percentage of bunches afflicted by DBWD were determined and compared among treatments.

In the second experiment nine female varieties (not exclusive of the first) were each crossed with male parents, 'TMB2x7197-2', 'TMB2x5105-1', and 'TMB2x8075-7' from January 1998 till December 2000. One of the interesting insights obtained from this study is that the number of seeds obtained from pollinations in East African Highland banana varied at different times of the year.

In addition, we carried out two indirect estimates of the reproductive system, based on pollen/ovule and seed/ovule ratios, which resulted in typical features of xenogamous species. We concluded that C. jacobinae has a late- acting self-incompatibility system.

Populations of S. acaulis in Greenland are subdioecious, consisting of female, hermaphrodite, and male individuals. The sex expression of males and hermaphrodites can vary over years for the same individual, while females are always females. Previous studies have shown that outcrossed seeds from females become seedlings with higher survival and growth rates than those from outcrossed seeds from hermaphrodites. Questions: (1) Do pollen grains from males exhibit some advantage over pollen from hermaphrodites? In particular, do they sire more seeds than hermaphrodites? (2) Is the reproductive system of S. acaulis stable or is it evolving towards one with fewer morphs (i.e. dioecy or gynodioecy)? Hypothesis: Pollen from male plants is better at siring seeds on females than pollen from hermaphrodites. Study system: A subdioecious population of S. acaulis in Greenland, containing male individuals that produce pollen and rarely or never set seed, hermaphrodites that produce both pollen and seeds, and females that produce only seeds. Methods: A pollen-competition experiment was performed in which females were hand pollinated with a mixture of pollen from males and hermaphrodites, all with known isozyme alleles, which allowed determination of who sired each seed. We recorded plant size, flower morphology, fruit and seed set, as well as pollen per anther for the individuals used in the experiment, as well as for a large number of other individuals to allow us to make comparisons between the three types of individuals. Conclusions: Well-developed pollen grains from males or hermaphrodites did not differ in their seed-siring capacity, although males had significantly more well-developed pollen grains per anther than hermaphrodites. Hence, on a per flower basis, males would be predicted to sire more seeds than hermaphrodites. However, given that males and hermaphrodites produce similar numbers of flowers per square centimetre of cushion and that male plants were significantly smaller than hermaphrodites, hermaphrodites have the potential to contribute relatively more to the seed pool than males. Calculations based on our quantitative results suggest that the dynamics of the population should develop slowly towards gynodioecy. However, this conclusion applies only as long as the population does not experience a significant change in the environmental conditions over time. © 2009 Marianne Philipp.",Arctic; Gynodioecy; Pollen competition; Silene acaulis; Subdioecy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350163235

Location Mediterranean Basin, Aegean archipelago. Methods Phylogenies for Nigella L. and Garidella L. (= Nigella s. lat.) were obtained from maximum-likelihood analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Diversification through time was analysed by log lineages-through-time (LTT) plots and survival analyses. Relative node age estimates were regressed against the degree of sympatry between sister clades to infer the predominant mode of geographical speciation in Nigella s. lat. Results The Late Pleistocene radiation of the Nigella arvensis complex in the Aegean region caused a significant departure from a stochastic speciation/extinction process of diversification during the evolution of Nigella s. lat., a lineage of (at least) Late Miocene origin. Speciation within Nigella s. lat. predominantly took place in allopatry. Main conclusions No significant effect on diversification rate was found regarding the establishment of a Mediterranean-type climate, or the onset of the Quaternary climatic oscillations. Rather, the accelerated rate of speciation in the N. arvensis complex is plausibly related to increased opportunities for allopatric speciation afforded by the (palaeo)geographical complexity of the Aegean archipelago combined with Late Pleistocene changes in climate and sea level. The evolution of self-pollination and associated changes in habitat preference and flowering time further augmented speciation and niche differentiation within the complex, but these changes did not act as the primary promoters of the radiation process. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Aegean archipelago; Allopatric speciation; Diversification rate; ITS; Lineages-through-time; Nigella; Rapid radiation; Survival analyses,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649209982

In this paper, we present the global assessment of the conservation status of a narrow endemic plant from the Sardinian-Corsican biogeographic province, by applying IUCN criteria and categories, together with an evaluation of some reproductive traits. Centaurea horrida Badaro (Asteraceae) is an endemic species of northern Sardinia (Italy). It is protected by the Bern Convention (Appendix I) and listed as priority species by the ""Habitat"" Directive (92/43/EEC, Annex II). The species appears in the 1997 IUCN Red List as ""Vulnerable"" (VU). With the aim of evaluating the risk of extinction and of providing management tools for the network of protected areas in which this species is present, some reproductive traits have been evaluated, and the distribution, size and structure of its population have been measured according to IUCN 2006 Guidelines. Centaurea horrida is not able to self-pollinate and its effective seed dispersal ability is limited. Its extent of occurrence is 172.43 km2 and its area of occupancy is 108 km2. Population size has been estimated at 11,719 adult individuals. Significant differences in adult densities among sites have been highlighted. The structure of the population is dominated by adult individuals (on average 68%), while the proportion of seedlings is only 7% on average. Its habitat underwent an extinction rate of 18% in 50 years. On the basis of the data gathered, the status to be assigned to C. horrida is that of ""Endangered"" (EN). This first attempt to evaluate the conservation status of a narrow endemic plant from the Sardinian-Corsican biogeographic province allowed us to conclude that the management of rare species must be site-specific and that there is urgent need to acquire detailed data on endangered species, especially within biodiversity hotspots, and to continuously update Annex II of the EU Habitat Directive and the IUCN Red List. © 2009 Società Botanica Italiana.",Habitat Directive; IUCN; Life history; Population size; Population structure; Reproductive traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949120851

The 29 studies reviewed here support this hypothesis as they all report spatially diverged selection trajectories which have generated variable outcomes in the interaction traits among populations. This holds for both mutualistic interactions such as those between host plants and their root symbionts, or plants and their pollinators, as well as for antagonistic interactions such as plants and their pathogens or herbivores. Most often, it is the strength of selection that varies across landscapes. Variation may be generated by both the physical environment (namely temperature), and the local community - competitors, parasites, and alternative hosts - that intensify or dilute selection locally for a wide range of species interactions. At its extreme, selection trajectories may be reversed with an antagonistic interaction being commensalistic in some populations and mutualistic in yet others, depending on the local community context. Selection trajectories were found to diverge among continents, but also more locally among neighbouring populations and even within a single population.

The mucilage secretory cells of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat undergo a complex differentiation process in which cell growth is followed by the synthesis and secretion of pectinaceous mucilage. A number of genes have been identified affecting mucilage secretory cell differentiation, including MUCILAGE-MODIFIED4 (MUM4). mum4 mutants produce a reduced amount of mucilage and cloning of MUM4 revealed that it encodes a UDP-L-rhamnose synthase that is developmentally up-regulated to provide rhamnose for mucilage pectin synthesis. To identify additional genes acting in mucilage synthesis and secretion, a screen for enhancers of the mum4 phenotype was performed. Eight mum enhancers (men) have been identified, two of which result from defects in known mucilage secretory cell genes (MUM2 and MYB61). Our results show that, in a mum4 background, mutations in MEN1, MEN4, and MEN5 lead to further reductions in mucilage compared to mum4 single mutants, suggesting that they are involved in mucilage synthesis or secretion. Conversely, mutations in MEN2 and MEN6 appear to affect mucilage release rather than quantity. With the exception of men4, whose single mutant exhibits reduced mucilage, none of these genes have a single mutant phenotype, suggesting that they would not have been identified outside the compromised mum4 background.",Arabidopsis thaliana; Cell wall; Germination; MEN; Mucilage; MUM4; Pectin; Rhamnogalacturonan I; RHM2; Seed coat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649357167

In this study, the Stock-6-derived, haploid-inducing line CAUHOI with high kernel oil content (KOC), was used as the pollinator to produce maternal haploids from the maize hybrid ZD958 with low KOC. CAUHOI is homozygous for the dominant marker gene R1-nj. Haploids were identified by morphological and cytological investigations. The frequency of haploid induction from this cross was 2.21%. Unexpectedly, many haploid kernels had weakly pigmented purple color on the embryo, and some haploid kernels had high KOC. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that 43.18% of the haploids carried segments from CAUHOI, and a small proportion (average 1.84%) of the genome of CAUHOI was introgressed into haploids. Haploid kernels with high KOC had a higher frequency of segment introgression from CAUHOI (2.92%) than that in haploid kernels with low KOC (1.79%), showing that the marker gene R1-nj and high-oil genes from CAUHOI were expressed during the development of some haploid embryos, and confirmed that the DNA introgression from the inducer parent occurred during maternal haploid induction. Together, these results suggested that the chromosome elimination was probably responsible for haploid induction in maize, and late somatic elimination might occur.

Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar 'Hayward' and its male pollinator 'Chieftain'. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes ?-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night. The monoterpene (E)-?-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated from a 'Hayward' petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily (E,E)-?-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-?-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles.

Isolation in time could also contribute to gene flow management but has been little investigated. We assessed the effects of asynchronous and synchronous flowering on intraspecific B. napus gene flow by seeding adjacent plots of transgenic spring canola cultivars, either resistant to glyphosate or glufosinate, over a 0-4 week interval and measuring outcrossing rates and seed-set. Outcrossing rates, evaluated in the center of the first adjacent row, were reduced to the lowest level in plots flowering first when the seeding interval >l2 weeks. Increasing the time gap increased outcrossing rates in plots flowering second up to a seeding interval of two weeks. Flowers that opened during the last week of the flowering period produced fewer seed (<10% of total seed production) and a smaller fraction of outcrossed seed (-25%). Observed time gap effects were likely caused by extraneous pollen load during the receptivity of productive seed-setting early flowers. Clearly, manipulation of B. napus flowering development through staggered planting dates can contribute to gene flow management. The approach will need to be validated by additional site-years and increased isolation distances. © 2009 ISBR EDP Sciences.",Assortative mating; Canola; Genetic purity; Genetically modified organisms; Herbicide resistant crops; Oilseed rape; Pollen-mediated gene flow; Transgenic contamination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73549103817

Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in floral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Bombus spp.; Community ecology; Conopidae; Ecological interactions; Food web; Heathland; Natural enemies; Network; Parasitism; Restoration ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650678381

Flowers are hermaphrodites, unlike the other species of the same genus that are dioic.

The different management conditions did not alter the sexual expression neither the production of fruits which varied from 0.9 to 6.4 %; but there was a reduction in the production of fruits possibly due to the absence of pollinators; 61.8 % of inflorescences of each plant did not render fruits; in 38.2 % one to eight fruits per inflorescence were detected, of which 93 % formed a well developed seed and the other one aborted, and the remaining 7 % presented two seeds per fruit.

Unreduced (2n) gametes are an interesting tool for polyploidisation and the creation of genetic variation in plant breeding. Especially in ornamentals, polyploidisation can broaden attractive features within a species. A Begonia collection was screened on the occurrence of 2n pollen with the aid of four different techniques: pollen size measurement, flow cytometric analysis of nuclei isolated from germinated and non germinated pollen, investigation of the microsporogenesis and analysis of progeny. In ten of the 70 screened genotypes (B. dregei, B. pearcei, B. 'Anna Christina', B. 'Bubbles', B. 'Florence Rita', B. 'Orococo', B. 'Rubaiyat', B. 'Spatflacier', B. 'Tamo' and B276), large pollen were observed with a rather spherical than normal ellipsoidal shape. Flow cytometric data proved that these aberrantly shaped pollen were associated with 2n ploidy levels, although they were not always viable. Meiotic aberrations in these large pollen producers resulted mainly in dyads although also monads, triads and polyads were observed. Successful crosses were obtained with B. dregei, B.

It notes that Gregory Bateson argued that any condition of ecosystem collapse would be characterized first by a collapse in its communicative order rather, than from changed physical states. The collapse of bee colonies and demise of other pollinators is a seeming confirmation of Gregory Bateson argument. Honeybees are 'go betweens' in ecosystemic order. It also argues that an appropriate topology of timing cycles and their recursions would enable better visual comprehension of the heterarchical 'pattern which connects', in Bateson's phrase, and prompt awareness of possible catastrophe in human food supplies. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Communication; Don McNeil; Go-betweens in ecosystems; Gregory Bateson; Honeybee-plant recursions; Sterile nectar; Topology of timing cycles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650671126

Habitat gardening for bees, using targeted ornamental plants, can predictably increase bee diversity and abundance, and provide clear pollination benefits.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954536602

Stamen specification and anther development involve a number of extraordinary events such as meristem transition, cell division and differentiation, cell to cell communication, etc., which need the cooperative interaction of sporophytic and gametophytic genes. The advent of various tools for rice functional gene identification, such as complete genome sequence, genome-wide microarrays, collections of mutants, has greatly facilitated our understanding of mechanisms of rice stamen specification and anther development.

A new seedless mandarin cultivar 'Wuzishatangju' and its original seeded cultivar 'Shatangju' were used to study the mechanism of seedlessness from the beginning of fertility. Embryonic development, compatibility of self-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' and cross-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' ('Wuzishatangju' × 'Ponkan', 'Wuzishatangju' × 'Shatangju') were studied. Results indicated that the male gametes of 'Wuzishatangju' were healthy. Fertility of the 'Wuzishatangju' embryo sac was normal and the mature embryo sac had one egg, two synergids, three antipodal cells and one big central cell containing two polar nuclei. Embryonic development of cross-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' was normal. Many globular embryos and a few heart-shaped embryos were observed 2 weeks after cross-pollination (WACP). Heart- and torpedo-shaped embryos were observed at three WACP while embryos reached the torpedo stage at four WACP. Cotyledonary embryos were observed at five WACP and they developed into seeds while funiculi were still existent at seven WACP. However, embryonic development of self-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' was abnormal and most embryos, which degenerated by 2 weeks after self-pollination (WASP), disappeared and seedless fruits were produced by four WASP. Pollen tubes of cross-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' could grow normally in the stigma, style and ovary, and they entered into the embryo sac resulting in successful fertilization. The pollen tubes of self-pollinated 'Wuzishatangju' grew well in the stigma and style; however, when they entered into the ovary, they became twisted and could not enter the embryo sac. Results indicate that the activities of the male gamete and the fertility of the embryo sac of 'Wuzishatangju' were functioning normally with no embryo abortion during embryonic development.

No natural sources with resistance to CSVd have been reported. By quantifying the CSVd titer within the plant, we identified the cultivar 'Utage' as a plant in which the increase of the CSVd titer was slowest among 6 cultivars tested. 'Utage' self-pollinated, and 67 resulting seedlings were screened for CSVd resistance using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested-PCR, micro-tissue (MT) direct RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR. Of these 67 seedlings, 9 plants lacked the obvious CSVd band detected by RT-PCR. Five months after grafting to CSVd-infected plants, the CSVd titers of 3 plants (C7, A30, and A27) were about 1/240,1/41000, and 1/125000 compared to that of 'Utage', respectively. These 3 plants were comfirmed to have strong resistance to CSVd. In C7, local distribution of CSVd was observed in the youngest expanded leaf by micro-tissue direct RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. For A30 and A27, CSVd was hardly detected in the whole plant. These 3 plants will contribute to the elucidation of CSVd resistance mechanisms.

The family contains diverse floral forms ranging from radial to monosymmetric flowers with a wide variety of insect pollinators. Additionally, Aristolochia species contain secondary metabolites that are important natural toxins and traditional medicines, and are critical to the reproduction of swallowtail butterflies. These characteristics, in combination with the small genome size and short life cycle of A. fimbriata, have prompted further development of this species as a model system to study the evolution of basal angiosperms. As a prerequisite for developing a genetic transformation procedure for Aristolochia, we developed protocols for in vitro plant multiplication, shoot organogenesis, rooting, and acclimation of tissue culture-derived plants. Two varieties of Aristolochia were multiplied in vitro and rooted with 100% efficiency. Shoot regeneration was achieved within 1 month of culture initiation from whole leaf, internodal stem, and petiole explants. The highest regeneration success (97%) was recorded for stem explants. Regenerated and rooted shoots were acclimated to greenhouse conditions and developed flowers within 4 weeks of transplanting. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aristolochia fimbriata; Basal angiosperm; Micropropagation; Shoot organogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349104412

While numerous studies have investigated the community and ecosystem consequences of genetic variation at the hybrid cross type or genotype level within a species, none has investigated the community-level effects of intraspecific genetic variation across the geographic range of a widespread species. This is the scale at which geographic mosaics of coevolution are hypothesized to exist. Studies at this level are particularly important for foundation tree species, which typically support numerous microbial, fungal, plant, and animal communities. We studied genetic variation across eight geographical races of the forest tree Eucalyptus globulus representing its natural distribution across southeastern Australia. The study was conducted in a 15-year-old common garden trial based on families derived from single-tree open-pollinated seed collections from the wild. Neutral molecular genetic variation within E. globulus was also assessed and compared with genetic divergence in the phenotypic and community traits. Three major findings emerged. First, we found significant genetically based, hierarchical variation in associated communities corresponding to geographical races of E. globulus and families within races. Second, divergence in foliar communities at the racial level was associated with genetically based divergence in specific leaf morphological and chemical traits that have known defensive functions. Third, significant positive correlations between canopy community dissimilarity and both neutral molecular genetic and leaf quantitative genetic dissimilarity at the race level supported a genetic similarity rule. Our results argue that genetic variation within foundation tree species has the potential to be a significant driver of the geographical mosaics of variation typical of forest communities, which could have important ecological and evolutionary implications. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",(co)evolution; Australia; Common garden trial; Community genetics; Eucalyptus globulus; Forest tree; Leaf morphology; Neutral molecular markers; Plant secondary chemistry; Plant-animal interactions; Provenance trial,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349277183

Wetting of mature seeds leads to the rapid bursting of these mucilage secretory cells to release a hydrophilic gel that surrounds the seed and is believed to aid in seed hydration and germination. A novel mutant is identified where mucilage release is both patchy and slow and whose seeds display delayed germination. While developmental analysis of mutant seeds reveals no change in mucilage secretory cell morphology, changes in monosaccharide quantities are detected, suggesting the mucilage release defect results from altered mucilage composition. Plasmid rescue and cloning of the mutant locus revealed a T-DNA insertion in AtBXL1, which encodes a putative bifunctional ?-D-xylosidase/?-L-arabinofuranosidase that has been implicated as a ?-D-xylosidase acting during vascular development. Chemical and immunological analyses of mucilage extracted from bxl1 mutant seeds and antibody staining of developing seed coats reveal an increase in (1?5)-linked arabinans, suggesting that BXL1 is acting as an ?-L-arabinofuranosidase in the seed coat. This implication is supported by the ability to rescue mucilage release through treatment of bxl1 seeds with exogenous ?-L-arabinofuranosidases. Together, these results suggest that trimming of rhamnogalacturonan I arabinan side chains is required for correct mucilage release and reveal a new role for BXL1 as an ?-L-arabinofuranosidase acting in seed coat development. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650139088

The fatty-acid composition makes this seed oil valuable for use in cosmetics, lubricants, rubber additives, and plastics. While a few meadowfoam cultivars have been developed, high-yielding germplasm is required for further crop improvement. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential seed production and associated morphological and phenological characteristics of 24 L. alba germplasm accessions maintained by the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System. The average seed yield varied from 39.3 to 221.3 g plot-1 and was signifi cantly different among years in this evaluation. The average number of seeds fl oret-1 under pollination by naturally occurring insects was similar to the number of seeds developed without presence of pollinators. The number of days from sowing to fi rst 10 and 50% bloom, as well as to the fi rst and last seed maturity, varied signifi cantly among years and accessions. Seed yield was positively correlated with 100-seed weight, the interval between fi rst 10 and 50% bloom, and longest seed-bearing stem. The number of seeds fl oret-1 was not signifi cantly correlated with seed yield. Signifi cant interaction between accessions and years was observed for number of seeds fl oret-1 developed without insect pollinators, the interval between fi rst 10 and 50% bloom, longest seed-bearing stem, number of days from sowing to fi rst and last harvest, and harvest spread. Some germplasm accessions evaluated in this study had a higher seed yield than yields reported in the literature and exhibited adVantageous characteristics applicable in meadowfoam improvement. © Crop Science Society of America.",GDD; Growing degree-days,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67849114246

Because people believe that it brings good luck and like to either keep it or present it to a loved one, it has commercial and ornamental value. To breed four-leaf clover, we exposed its flowers to ?-rays at the pollination stage. The M1 seeds produced following doses at 25-100 Gy showed an approximately 74% germination rate, with seedling survival at 46%. In the M1 generation of plants irradiated within that dose range, we found an increased frequency of four leaflets. One of them, Jeju Lucky-1 (JL-1), had a frequency of about 60%. To see whether that mutation was somaclonal or genetic, we observed its M2 generation and found that such a phenotype reappeared. Although our results demonstrated that the irradiation of fully mature flowers led to a higher frequency of 4-leaflets, we could not clearly explain the genetic mechanism involved. We suggest that JL-1 is valuable as a new variety, without further genetic fixation, because white clover can be propagated vegetatively by stolons. © Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer 2009.",Four-leaf white clover; Gamma (?)-ray; Mutation; Stolon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71449126438

Intercrossing during line development can be used to counter this disadvantage but requires additional generations and is diffi cult in self-pollinated species. It is desirable to improve mapping resolution for success of marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. Here we propose a way of achieving this through recombination enrichment. This method is based on genotyping at each generation and advancing lines selected for high recombination and/or low heterozygosity. In simulations, the method yields lines that represent up to twice as many recombination events as RILs developed conventionally by selfi ng without selection, or the same amount but in three generations, without reduction in homozygosity. Compared to methods that require maintaining a large population for several generations andselecting lines only from the fi nished population, the method proposed here achieves up to 25% more recombination.

It thus plays a major role in pollinator floral constancy and plant gene flow. Honeybees are the primary model for pollinator associative learning, but bumblebees play an important ecological role in a wider range of habitats, and their associative learning abilities are less well understood. We assayed learning with the proboscis extension reflex (PER), using a novel method for restraining bees (capsules) designed to improve bumblebee learning. We present the first results demonstrating that bumblebees exhibit the memory spacing effect. They improve their associative learning of odor and nectar reward by exhibiting increased memory acquisition, a component of long-term memory formation, when the time interval between rewarding trials is increased. Bombus impatiens forager memory acquisition (average discrimination index values) improved by 129% and 65% at inter-trial intervals (ITI) of 5 and 3 min, respectively, as compared to an ITI of 1 min. Memory acquisition rate also increased with increasing ITI. Encapsulation significantly increases olfactory memory acquisition. Ten times more foragers exhibited at least one PER response during training in capsules as compared to traditional PER harnesses. Thus, a novel conditioning assay, encapsulation, enabled us to improve bumblebee-learning acquisition and demonstrate that spaced learning results in better memory consolidation. Such spaced learning likely plays a role in forming long-term memories of rewarding floral resources. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Associative learning; Bumblebees; Classical conditioning; Memory spacing effect; Olfactory conditioning; Proboscis extension reflex; Trial spacing effect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349601661

To date, the effects of florivore activity on the volatile profile of flowers and subsequent attractiveness to pollinators have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we had three specific objectives: to determine the impact of florivory by the parsnip webworm Depressaria pastinacella on the floral volatile profile of the wild parsnip Pastinaca sativa, to ascertain the mechanisms by which florivory changes the volatile profile, and to estimate the consequences of florivory on visitation by pollinators and eventual seed set. An overall indirect effect of webworms on seed set, that is, the effect of infestation on pollination success, was not detected. However, this overall lack of indirect effect masks the heterogeneity among individual plants. For seven of 14 plants examined, pollination success was altered by webworms, and in four of these plants the alteration in pollination success was consistent with webworm-altered visitation. Webworms significantly altered floral fragrance, in particular causing disproportionate increases in the emissions of octyl esters. Additionally, volatiles from webworm frass, which contains large amounts of the octyl ester metabolite n -octanol, may alter the floral fragrance in ways that change attractiveness of flowers to pollinators. This study suggests that the effects of florivores on plant fitness are not limited to the removal of floral units but may also involve alterations in floral volatile composition, through damage-induced release and detoxification of particular constituents, that affect visitation and pollination success. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Chemistry; Florivore; Herbivory; Pollination; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349092778

Because flower functionality may act on the respective mean values of pollen size and pistil length rather than on intraspecific variation in these traits, we expected (1) a high positive correlation between pollen size and pistil length in a set of sympatric species, independent of their degree of pollination specialization or generalization; and (2) no interspecific correlation between the coefficients of variation (CVs) of those traits. On the other hand, on the assumption that pollinators are influencing the variation in floral traits (e.g. in pistil length) we expected lower mean phenotypic variation of pollen size and pistil length in pollination-specialist plants than in pollination-generalist ones. A positive correlation between pollen size and pistil length was found for the set of species, but not between the CVs of these traits. This trend was maintained when pollination-specialist plants were analyzed separately, but no statistical significance was obtained for the correlation in pollination-generalist plants. Contrary to our expectations, pollination-specialist plants did not show less mean intraspecific variation in floral traits than pollination-generalist plants. Therefore, the relationship between pollen size and pistil length among species suggests that the pollination system may be of less importance as a selective force than flower functionality. © 2009 Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.",Coefficient of variation; Functional correlation; Pistil length; Pollen size; Pollination systems; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149150239

Although the selective pressures that flowers impose on tongue length are relatively straightforward, in that longer tongues allow access to more nectar, selective pressures that pollinators impose on flower length are less clear. Here, we test for such selective pressures in the highly specialized mutualism between the nectar bat Anoura fistulata, which can extend its tongue twice as far as other nectar bats, and Centropogon nigricans, which has flowers of a similar length (8-9 cm). We used flight cage experiments to examine the effects of artificially manipulated flower lengths on (i) bat behaviour and (ii) pollen transfer. Increased length produced longer visits, but did not affect the force bats applied during visits. In the second experiment, flower length increased both the male and female components of flower function: long male flowers delivered more pollen grains and long female flowers received more pollen grains. However, pollen transfer was not correlated with visit duration, so the mechanism behind differences in pollen transfer remains unclear. By demonstrating that bats select for increasing flower length, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that A. fistulata evolved its remarkable tongue in a coevolutionary race with long-tubed flowers similar to that envisioned by Darwin. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Anoura fistulata; Bat pollination; Centropogon nigricans; Chiropterophily; Coevolution; Darwin's race,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66749134786

This study considers bees and their pollinating importance in the livelihood of farmers, in order to understand the level of knowledge local farmers have about bees, and their role in crop production. A questionnaire was sent in January and February 2006 to representatives of 352 households randomly selected from 19,972 households living around the forest. Respondents were shown pictures and specimens of different insects, and after correct identification, were asked to state the food sources and nesting sites of these bees. They were asked to state how they utilize these bees and about their willingness to conserve them as pollinators. We found that Kakamega farmers could identify bees of different species, and had some knowledge of bee floral and nesting needs. Only about 50% were, however, aware of pollination and could relate it to crop productivity, but after having been introduced to the importance of bee pollination in crop production, they showed willingness to conserve bees for such purposes. © IBRA 2009.",Bee conservation; Bee identification; Folk knowledge; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67249089243

Two transects were created in the north and south of the forest extending to about eight km into the farmland. Observations were carried out on 14 sites on either side of the forest during the flowering period from April to June in 2005 and 2006. We recorded bees belonging to 20 species visiting beans. The honey bee Apis mellifera X was the most abundant, followed by two solitary bees, Xylocopa calens and Xylocopa incostans. Bee density was low In the farmland in both sides of the forest, but diversity was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the southern than in the northern transect. One reason for this is that the southern side is heavily populated so hedges and other land are under higher pressure, giving bees no alternative to crop flowers, whilst in the north, the population is low so there is still much land and hedges for alternative food for bees. Hedge management could be improved to support bees, especially when crops are not in flower, by interconnecting the hedges with the forest, so bees will be able to seek refugia and other needs in the forest and be able to provide pollination in the farmland, hence contributing to food security in the country. © IBRA 2009.",Apis mellifera; Bee visitation; Kenya; Phaseolus vulgaris; Xylocopa calens; Xylocopa incostans,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67249087287

Apis cerana indica, Apis dorsata, Trigona iridipennis and Amegilla spp. were observed in cardamom plantations of south India. Since cardamom is attacked by an array of insect pests, synthetic insecticides were used in crop management. Diafenthiuron is one such insecticide found to be very effective against the cardamom borer, Conogethes punctiferalis and thrips, Sciothrips cardamomi Most insecticides used in crop protection are reported to be hazardous to bees, so diafenthiuron was also tested for its toxicity to bees. Diafenthiuron was found to be slightly harmful to A. dorsata, A. cerana indica, A. florea and moderately harmful to T. iridipennis. In particular, It was slightly to moderately toxic to bees on contact with treated surfaces in the laboratory. T. iridipennis and A. dorsata are found abundantly in the cardamom ecosystem and unfortunately highly susceptible to the insecticide. It was found that diafenthiuron Is highly toxic when applied to the thorax of bees but it is less toxic on ingestion, i.e, contact toxicity is higher than oral toxicity. The labellum, the attractive part of the cardamom flower, where the bees land Is not heavily exposed to pesticide sprays in the field because of its position and other reasons, so bees have a reduced chance of exposure to the pesticide in the field.

For simplicity, we consider trade-off in resource allocation between attractive structure (petals etc.) and female function (seeds and fruits) with neglecting the amount of resource allocated to male function (pollens and stamens). We show that ES resource allocation does not much depend on the detail of the probability distribution of the number of pollinator visit on a flower, but on the probability that a flower fails to be visited. We also find that: (1) When the flowers are self-incompatible, the ES allocation to the attractive structure monotonically increases as the availability of pollinators in the environment decreases. (2) When there is strong positive correlation among flowers in the number of pollinator visit, the ES allocation is larger than the case without the correlation. (3) When the flowers are self-compatible and engage prior selfing, the ES allocation monotonically increases as the availability of pollinators in the environment decreases to a threshold, under which it suddenly decreases to zero. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-incompatibility is an important mechanism used in many species to prevent inbreeding; it is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus. Self (incompatible) pollen is discriminated from non-self (compatible) pollen by interaction of pollen and pistil S locus components, and is subsequently inhibited. In Papaver rhoeas, the pistil S locus product is a small protein that interacts with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca 2+-dependent signalling network, resulting in pollen inhibition and programmed cell death. Here we have cloned three alleles of a highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS (Papaver rhoeas pollen S), from Papaver and provide evidence that this encodes the pollen S locus determinant. PrpS is a single-copy gene linked to the pistil S gene (currently called S, but referred to hereafter as PrsS for Papaver rhoeas stigma S determinant). Sequence analysis indicates that PrsS and PrpS are equally ancient and probably co-evolved. PrpS encodes a novel 20-kDa protein. Consistent with predictions that it is a transmembrane protein, PrpS is associated with the plasma membrane. We show that a predicted extracellular loop segment of PrpS interacts with PrsS and, using PrpS antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that PrpS is involved in S-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. Identification of PrpS represents a major advance in our understanding of the Papaver self-incompatibility system. As a novel cell-cell recognition determinant it contributes to the available information concerning the origins and evolution of cell-cell recognition systems involved in discrimination between self and non-self, which also include histocompatibility systems in primitive chordates and vertebrates. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649262029

The attractant for the former fly species was especially effective, as sticky traps containing 0.25 ml of MeSa captured (814 ± 55) D. busckii flies/trap on average compared to (12 ± 4) flies/trap in control traps.

Yet, few studies distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and isolation, or how multiple ecosystem services may be affected simultaneously. We investigated the effects of variation in cover of woody and open semi-natural habitats and isolation from forest on the relative functioning of pollination, seed predation and insect scavenging in agricultural landscapes. We established 30 sites in grassland locations in the Swiss plateau around Berne. The sites varied independently in their isolation from forest edges, in the percentage of woody habitats and in the percentage of open semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape (500 m radius). We experimentally exposed primroses, sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring 2008. None of the three studied services was affected by variation in woody or open semi-natural habitat cover. However, the proportion of flowers setting seed was significantly reduced by isolation from forest. Further, seed predation and insect scavenging were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites connected to woody habitat. This pattern was particularly pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible to vertebrates. Thus, all three studied services responded quite similarly to the landscape context.

Watermelon generally has a lot of staminate flowers; however, they only have a small amount of pollen. Watermelon pollen cannot be used in pollination under the present situation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine which is the most effective pollen extender medium for cultivation of watermelon with soft X-ray irradiated pollen. In this experiment, 'Agar,' 'Marriage powder,' and 'Sekishoshi' (Lycopodium dyed red with safflower pigment) were used as extender media with soft X-ray irradiated pollen at equal or twice the weight of the pollen. When 'Sekishoshi' was used as an extender medium, fruit set was very low. A lot of deformed fruit was produced when agar was used with the pollen. On the other hand, when 'Marriage powder' was used in equal proportions with the pollen, fruit set was about 70% and, moreover, Brix was high. Thus, the mixture of 'Marriage powder' with an equal amount of pollen was the best for use in actual cultivation.

As self-compatibility was observed in some S8S23 and S8Sfa individuals of this progeny, the Sf haplotype may not always be linked to the expression and transmission of self-compatibility in almond, suggesting that a modifier locus may be involved in the mechanism of self-incompatibility in plants. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Modifier gene; Self-(in)compatibility; Transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349847428

After it was found that features extracted from patterns of wing venation are sufficient to discriminate among insect species, various studies have focused on this structure. We examined wing venation patterns of males and workers of five stingless bee species in order to determine if there are differences between sexes and if these differences are greater within than between species. Geometric morphometric analyses were made of the forewings of males and workers of Nannotrigona testaceicornis, Melipona quadrifasciata, Frieseomelitta varia, and Scaptotrigona aff. depilis and Plebeia remota. The patterns of males and workers from the same species were more similar than the patterns of individuals of the same sex from different species, and the patterns of both males and workers, when analyzed alone, were sufficiently different to distinguish among these five species. This demonstrates that we can use this kind of analysis for the identification of stingless bee species and that the sex of the individual does not impede identification.

Many use changing signals as indicators that visitation and/or pollination have occurred [2, 3]). Floral color change is commonly used to transmit this information [3-7] (often correlated with reduced nectar reward [8, 9]) and can be specifically triggered by pollination or visitation. By retaining color-changed flowers, plants benefit from larger floral displays but also indicate at close range which flowers are still rewarding (and still unpollinated), so that visitors forage more efficiently [5, 6]. However, the legume Desmodium setigerum shows a unique ability, if inadequately pollinated, to reverse its flowers' color and shape changes. Single visits by bees mechanically depress the keel and expose stigma and anthers (termed ""tripping""); visits also initiate a rapid color change from lilac to white and turquoise and a slower morphological change, the upper petal folding downwards over the reproductive parts. But flowers receiving insufficient pollen can partially reopen, re-exposing the stigma, with a further color change to deeper turquoise and/or lilac. Thus, most flowers achieve pollination from one bee visit, but those with inadequate pollen receipt can reverse their signals, earning a ""second chance"" by eliciting attention from other potential pollinators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, evidence for a global crisis has been drawn from regional or local declines in pollinators themselves [6-9] or insufficient pollination for particular crops [9, 10]. In contrast, our analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [11] data reveals that the global population of managed honey-bee hives has increased ?45% during the last half century and suggests that economic globalization, rather than biological factors, drives both the dynamics of the global managed honey-bee population and increasing demands for agricultural pollination services [12]. Nevertheless, available data also reveal a much more rapid (>300%) increase in the fraction of agriculture that depends on animal pollination during the last half century, which may be stressing global pollination capacity. Although the primary cause of the accelerating increase of the pollinator dependence of commercial agriculture seems to be economic and political and not biological, the rapid expansion of cultivation of many pollinator-dependent crops has the potential to trigger future pollination problems for both these crops and native species in neighboring areas. Such environmental costs merit consideration during the development of agriculture and conservation policies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The space available for reserves is limited, however, and conservation efforts must increasingly consider how management of protected areas can promote biodiversity beyond reserve borders. Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity ""spillover"" effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30% of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10-18% more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape - higher edge-to-interior ratio - created by corridors. Corridors promoted biodiversity spillover for native species of the threatened longleaf pine ecosystem being restored in our experiment, but not for exotic species. By extending economically driven spillover concepts from marine fisheries and crop pollination systems, we show how reconnecting landscapes amplifies biodiversity conservation both within and beyond reserve borders.",Dispersal; Habitat corridors; Halos; Life-history traits; Reserve design,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67249143180

Although the functions of many plant epidermal cells have been described, the function of conical epidermal cells, a defining feature of petals in the majority of insect-pollinated flowers, has not [1, 2]. The location and frequency of conical cells have led to speculation that they play a role in attracting animal pollinators [1, 3, 4]. Snapdragon (Antirrhinum) mutants lacking conical cells have been shown to be discriminated against by foraging bumblebees [4]. Here we investigated the extent to which a difference in petal surface structure influences pollinator behavior through touch-based discrimination. To isolate touch-based responses, we used both biomimetic replicas of petal surfaces and isogenic Antirrhinum lines differing only in petal epidermal cell shape. We show that foraging bumblebees are able to discriminate between different surfaces via tactile cues alone. We find that bumblebees use color cues to discriminate against flowers that lack conical cells-but only when flower surfaces are presented at steep angles, making them difficult to manipulate. This facilitation of physical handling is a likely explanation for the prevalence of conical epidermal petal cells in most flowering plants. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying behaviourally mediated indirect effects of predators is necessary to properly understand their role in community dynamics. We used the tripartite relationship between bumblebees, predatory crab spiders and flowers to ask whether behaviourally mediated effects are localized to flowers harbouring predators, or whether bees extend their avoidance to entire plant species. In a tightly controlled laboratory environment, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were exposed to a random mixture of equally rewarding yellow and white artificial flowers, but foraging on yellow flowers was very risky: bees had a 25 per cent chance of receiving a simulated predation attempt by 'robotic' crab spiders. As bees learnt to avoid 'dangerous' flowers, their foraging preferences changed and they began to visit fewer yellow flowers than expected by chance. Bees avoided spider-free yellow flowers as well as dangerous yellow flowers when spiders were more difficult to detect (the colour of yellow spiders was indistinguishable from that of yellow flowers). Therefore, this interaction between bee learning and predator crypsis could lead flower species harbouring cryptic predators to suffer from reduced reproductive success. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Avoidance learning; Bombus terrestris; Crab spider; Foraging preferences; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149163237

However, the molecular mechanisms allowing compatible pollen to evade S-RNase attack are less clear, as compatible pollen tubes also import S-RNase. Using styles of the same age and size in order to lower the degree of inter-style variability in S-RNase levels, we observe reduction of up to 30% of the total non-self stylar S-RNase in vivo during compatible crosses, whereas no degradation of self S-RNases is detected. This marked difference in stylar S-RNase levels dovetails with measurements of pollen-specific Lat52 mRNA, which decreases four-fold in incompatible compared to compatible crosses. Unexpectedly, we also find evidence for a reciprocal signaling mechanism from compatible pollen to the cells of the transmitting tract that results in a roughly threefold decrease in S-RNase transcript levels.

Background. Universally accepted landmark stages are necessary to highlight key events in plant reproductive development and to facilitate comparisons among species. Domestication and selection of tomato resulted in many varieties that differ in fruit shape and size. This diversity is useful to unravel underlying molecular and developmental mechanisms that control organ morphology and patterning. The tomato fruit shape gene SUN controls fruit elongation. The most dramatic effect of SUN on fruit shape occurs after pollination and fertilization although a detailed investigation into the timing of the fruit shape change as well as gene expression profiles during critical developmental stages has not been conducted. Results. We provide a description of floral and fruit development in a red-fruited closely related wild relative of tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium accession LA1589. We use established and propose new floral and fruit landmarks to present a framework for tomato developmental studies. In addition, gene expression profiles of three key stages in floral and fruit development are presented, namely floral buds 10 days before anthesis (floral landmark 7), anthesis-stage flowers (floral landmark 10 and fruit landmark 1), and 5 days post anthesis fruit (fruit landmark 3). To demonstrate the utility of the landmarks, we characterize the tomato shape gene SUN in fruit development. SUN controls fruit shape predominantly after fertilization and its effect reaches a maximum at 8 days post-anthesis coinciding with fruit landmark 4 representing the globular embryo stage of seed development. The expression profiles of the NILs that differ at sun show that only 34 genes were differentially expressed and most of them at a less than 2-fold difference. Conclusion. The landmarks for flower and fruit development in tomato were outlined and integrated with the effect of SUN on fruit shape. Although we did not identify many genes differentially expressed in the NILs that differ at the sun locus, higher or lower transcript levels for many genes involved in phytohormone biosynthesis or signaling as well as organ identity and patterning of tomato fruit were found between developmental time points.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149127000

Self-incompatibility may be overcome by cross-pollination with other compatible varieties. Fruit quality and yield of 'Nova' citrus hybrid as well as of the 'SRA63' and 'Marisol' Clementines, when either they were self-pollinated in single variety plantings or each one of the two Clementine varieties was used as a pollenizer for 'Nova' in mixed plantings (plantings consisting of more than one variety), were investigated. The study was carried out for two successive years under the same environmental and cultural conditions using three single variety plantings ('Nova' × 'Nova', 'SRA63' × 'SRA63', 'Marisol' × 'Marisol') and two mixed plantings ('Nova' × 'SRA63', 'Nova' × 'Marisol'). Cross-pollination of 'Nova' with either 'SRA63' or 'Marisol' significantly increased fruit yield of 'Nova' trees and mean fresh weight of 'Nova' fruits without affecting the other fruit quality parameters [rind thickness, percentage of juice, concentration of total soluble solids (TSS) and total acids (TA) in the juice, and TSS/TA ratio). Although the number of seeds per each 'Nova' fruit significantly increased due to cross-pollination (from 0.7 in 'Nova' × 'Nova' planting to 1.8 and 2.1 in 'Nova' × 'Marisol' and 'Nova' × 'SRA63' plantings, respectively), it remained in a range (?2.1) which is by far acceptable in the fresh fruit market. On the other hand, each fruit produced by cross-pollinated 'Marisol' and 'SRA63' trees with 'Nova' contained an average of 2.4 and 18.6 seeds, respectively. The effects of 'Nova' pollen on the other fruit quality parameters (weight, TSS, TA, TSS/TA, juice content, rind thickness) of 'Marisol' and 'SRA63' were not significant. Therefore, 'Marisol' was proved to be a good pollenizer for 'Nova' and vice versa. Furthermore, 'SRA63' can be used as pollenizer in 'Nova' orchards. Instead, the use of 'Nova' trees as pollenizers in 'SRA63' orchards should be avoided since the seediness of 'SRA63' fruits was increased very much. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the foraging behavior of pollinators, especially Osmia cornifrons Radoszkowski, in order to evaluate their use instead of honeybees. O. cornifrons showed strong flower constancy for 4-8 min during one pollen-nectar foraging trip, as observed in honeybees. However, the bees seemed to forage for different types of flowers, e.g. from a red to a white petal color, during their 16-22 pollen-nectar foraging trips based on the S-RNase allele and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses of pollen loaves made during those trips. After one pollen-nectar foraging trip, the bees brushed their abdomen with their hind legs at a nester tube, but ca. 10% of pollen was not brushed from their bodies. The remaining pollen on the body retained the ability for the fertilization of apple for 12 days, suggesting that the pollen on the pollinator's body from a pollinizer could be used for the fertilization of a commercial cultivar visited on their next foraging trip. O. cornifrons seems to be a useful pollinator in apple orchards consisting of a single cultivar, such as, 'Fuji', and of pollinizers of different types, such as the red petal color type, 'Maypole' or 'Makamik'. Moreover, most pollen loaves investigated contained S28-RNase allele, which was specific for pollen of 'Starking Delicious' planted at a great distance (55.2 m) from the nestiny shelter, suggesting that O. cornifrons is a useful pollinator for 'Delicious', which is difficult for honeybees to use as a pollinator for its sideworking behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fruit growth in diameter followed a typical double sigmoid curve, consisting of two rapid growth stages, stage I and stage III, separated by a period of slow growth (stage II) at both altitudes. The durations of stages I, II and III were 105-119, 21-35 and 21-42 days, respectively, at low and high altitude. 'Harbiye' persimmons showed significant decreases in soluble tannin concentration and total carotenoid content during stage I. At the end of stage I, 'Harbiye' persimmons became non-astringent. Stage II was characterized with slow growth, the beginning of acid degradation and a significant increase in total sugars, especially in the sucrose component. At end of stage II, the fruit began to turn yellow-orange, indicating the occurrence of colour break. The greatest increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content occurred in the final month before harvest during stage III when pronounced changes in skin colour and softening of fruits were observed. The 175 and 168 days after full bloom (DAFB) at low and high altitudes, respectively, are appropriate timing for harvest of the 'Harbiye' persimmon fruits in the East Mediterranean region.

However, while many studies document behavioural responses of pollinators to floral scent, few document the relationship between floral scent and fitness. 2. In this study, we explore the effect of variation in floral scent emission in colour polymorphic Hesperis matronalis on both pollinator visitation and seed fitness. 3. Using target inflorescences augmented with colour-specific floral scent extracts, we find that diurnal floral visitors significantly prefer night-scent extracts to non-augmented controls; inflorescences augmented with day-scent extracts receive an intermediate level of visits. Colour did not have a significant effect on visitation. 4. We characterized the relationship between natural variation in floral scent emission rate and seed production for plants under two settings: in small experimental arrays exposed to either day- or night-flying pollinators, and in wild populations exposed to all pollinators. In arrays, we found greater emission rate led to higher seed production, but only in plants exposed to day-flying pollinators. In contrast, we found a significant positive relationship between night-time floral emission rate and seed fitness in wild populations. In neither setting did floral anthocycanin concentration (colour) affect fitness. 5. This study reinforces the idea that scent-mediated pollinator visitation is an important component of plant fitness. Moreover, our results suggest that plants emitting more scent have higher fitness, although there is variation as to when this positive relationship occurs (i.e., at day or night).

During collection, crops from many fields are combined to fill a silo. To avoid the risk of mixing GM and non-GM harvests, it is possible to dedicate a silo to a given crop or to define specific times for GM and non-GM product delivery to silos. To evaluate these scenarios for the maize supply chain, we propose a combination of a model of farmers' varietal choice (based on profit evaluation at the field level, taking into account transport costs as well as price and cost differences between GM and non-GM products) and a spatially-explicit gene flow model. Consequences of different segregation strategies for collection zone organization can therefore be compared while using the percentage of GM grain in non-GM crops due to cross-pollination. The 'temporal' strategy leads to a uniform area of GM or non-GM maize, depending on the prices and the weather risks. The 'spatial' strategy leads to areas of either GM or non-GM crops surrounding the corresponding collection silo. GM presence in non-GM batches depends on the size of the non-GM zone and on the prevailing wind. We show how divergent commercial strategies of grain merchants could have consequences on GM presence in non-GM batches. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Flowers of the African milkweed, Pachycarpus appendiculatus E. Mey, produce concentrated nectar that is consumed primarily by the large spider-hunting wasp Hemipepsis dedjas Guerin (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae). Pollinaria of this milkweed become attached to the palps of these wasps during nectar feeding. Broken wasp palps were found between guide rails, attached to corpuscula that were trapped behind the guide rails, and attached to pollinia that were inserted into the stigmatic chambers of the flowers. Approximately 85% of wasps captured on flowers of P. appendiculatus were missing one or more palps, whereas only 9% of wasps captured on flowers of another asclepiad species were missing any palps. It thus seems that wasps face a high risk of losing their palps when foraging on these flowers. The interaction may thus be antagonistic for the wasps if the cost of losing their sensory palps (not yet established) is greater than the benefits of the nectar reward. The plants, however, gain clear benefit from the interaction, as verified by the removal and insertion of pollinia in flowers exposed solely to visits by pompilid wasps. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Antagonism; Apocynaceae; Mutualism; Nectar; Pollination syndromes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60749136454

The number of ceratopogonid midges caught by the yellow-UVPPT was significantly higher than that by blue- and white-UVPPT. The diversity of midges caught could not be determined due to taxonomic difficulties, and thus all the three colours of UVPPT should be used until efficiency in terms of diversity is determined. It is reported here that the meliponine bee Liotrigona parvula Darchen visits cocoa flowers and thus their effectiveness in cocoa pollination should be investigated. © ICIPE 2009.",Ceratopogonid; Cocoa; McPhail trap; Meliponinae; Midges; Pollination; Pollinator; Suction pump; UVPPT,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849115893

We have performed parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses on separate and combined data sets comprising nine plastid genes (?12,000 bp), two nuclear genes (?5000 bp), and the plastid inverted repeat (?24,000 bp), giving a combined analyzed length of 42,006 bp for 36 species of Caryophyllales and four outgroups. We have recovered strong support for deep-level relationships across the order. Two major subclades are well supported, the noncore and core Caryophyllales; Rhabdodendron followed by Simmondsia are sisters to the core Caryophyllales, Limeum and Stegnosperma are successive sisters to the ''globular inclusion'' clade, Gisekia is a distinct lineage well separated from Rivina within the ''raphide'' clade, and Rivina and Phytolaccaceae are disparate lineages, with Rivina sister to Nyctaginaceae. The placement of Sarcobatus and relationships within the portulacaceous cohort remain problematic. Within the latter, Halophytum is sister to Basellaceae and Didiereaceae, and the clade comprising Portulaca, Talinum, and Cactaceae is well supported. Classical hypotheses argued that the early Caryophyllales had evolved in open, dry, marginal environments at a time when pollinators were scarce, and, as such, the ancestral caryophyllid flower was wind pollinated with an undifferentiated perianth. We reevaluated these hypotheses in light of our phylogeny and find little support for anemophily as the ancestral condition; however, the early caryophyllid flower is suggested to have possessed an undifferentiated perianth. A subsequent minimum of nine origins of differentiated perianth is inferred. We discuss the evidence for independent origins of differentiated perianth and highlight the research opportunities that this pattern offers to the field of evolutionary developmental genetics. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Timing of canopy closure and seasonal trend of pollinator frequency did not synchronize with the annual fluctuation in flowering phenology. In the early snowmelt year, seed-set success reflected the seasonal pollinator abundance from early to middle flowering periods. In the late snowmelt year, however, seed-set rates were independent of pollinator activity and decreased with canopy closing even after hand pollination. The restricted seed production by defoliation and the increase in seed-set rates at the forest edge suggested that seed production was supported by current photosynthetic carbon gain. Thus, annual fluctuations of reproductive success can explain the variation in flowering phenology within a population although seasonal light deterioration would serve as a selective force for flowering in the early season. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Gagea lutea; Light availability; Pollinator abundance; Seed-set; Temporal variations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349212111

Within the water lily family Cabombaceae, there is evidence that wind pollination arose recently in Brasenia, whereas the sister genus Cabomba became specialized for fly pollination. Both species have an apomorphic stylar extension, which in Brasenia became greatly elongated to produce a much larger stigmatic surface. Consequently, pollen tubes in Brasenia must travel much farther to reach ovules, and because mean pollen tube growth rates are similar (750-950 ?m/h), fertilization occurs ;?4 h later in Brasenia than in Cabomba. In both genera, pollen tubes grow between cells of the substigmatic ground tissue and then within an open, secretionfilled stylar canal and ovarian cavity. In Brasenia, early pollen tube development is slower than in Cabomba, which may be a result of displacement of flower opening to an earlier, cooler time of day. Our results show that modifications to carpel ontogeny and structure associated with the transition to wind pollination had consequences for pollen tube development and fertilization. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Greater statistical dispersion in pollination and fertilization among fl owers increases the frequency of windfall success, which should increase the strength of selection for greater ovule number per fl ower.

Furthermore, the mechanisms of achieving specialization are not clear since flowers typically produce exposed nectar and have no morphological adaptations (such as long spurs) to exclude non-pollinating visitors. We investigated the pollination of Xysmalobium orbiculare and explored the functional roles of floral scent and nectar in attracting pollinators and deterring nectar robbers. Floral visitor observations showed that this milkweed is visited almost exclusively by pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis. These wasps were the only insects to carry pollinia, and a cage experiment confirmed their effectiveness in removing and inserting pollinia on flowers. Hand-pollinations showed that plants are genetically self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinators for seed set. Palatability experiments with honeybees showed that nectar is distasteful to non-pollinating insects and is therefore likely to play a functional role in deterring nectar thieves. Choice experiments in the field showed that the wasp pollinators are attracted primarily by floral scent rather than visual cues. Analysis of spectral reflectance of flowers revealed that flowers are dull colored and are unlikely to stand out from the background vegetation. We conclude that X. orbiculare is specialized for pollination by spider-hunting wasps in the genus Hemipepsis and utilizes floral scent to selectively attract its pollinators and unpalatable nectar to deter non-pollinating visitors. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Apocynaceae; Asclepiadoideae; Breeding system; Floral filter; Pollination syndrome; Pompilidae; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349123696

Subsequently, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus became attached to each other in the egg cell and a globular embryo was formed. However, the embryo failed to differentiate into organ tissues and degenerated. It was suggested that seedless fruit induced by gamma rays had a beneficial effect in increasing the quantity and quality of watermelon yield via increases in the carotenoid, total sugar content and fruit weight.

This is particularly true for the management of populations of rare plant taxa. Western Australia contains over 45% of Australia's gazetted rare or threatened flora, 80% of which are found within the highly fragmented southwest region. Resources do not exist to undertake comprehensive studies on the population dynamics and demographics for every rare plant of this diverse region. Here, we describe a method of classifying rare plant taxa into functional groups as a basis for guiding rare flora conservation and management. Data on four floral and two life-history traits were collected for each of the 351 declared rare flora taxa of Western Australia. A hierarchical, agglomerative clustering method was applied to the resulting taxa by traits matrix to extract emergent groupings of plant taxa. The resulting polythetic groups were analysed to determine the variation in traits, including response to disturbance and recorded flower visitors, and how these may affect population persistence in a fragmented landscape. Multivariate methods were used to define emergent groups based on a combination of floral structure and life-history traits of the declared rare flora of Western Australia. Seven emergent functional groups were identified and were largely differentiated by flower shape and life form. These seven functional groupings varied significantly in their response to disturbance. By deriving these functional groups, we plan to develop models for each group on how rates of pollination, seed production and seed fitness are affected by population size and landscape context. The rationale would be to use these profiles to determine whether there are thresholds in population size or position in the landscape at which reproductive rates severely decline. General management guidelines could then be developed for each functional group. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Declared rare flora; Functional groups; Generalisation; Pollination; Western Australia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350162075

The role played by floral traits on reproductive success is well known, but the possible influence of pistil traits has been overlooked, probably because of the difficulty of non-destructive pistil examination. The aim of this work was to examine the influence of several pistil traits on reproductive success in apricot (Prunus armeniaca). For this purpose, in a population of individually labelled flowers, the styles were cut off once the pollen tubes had reached the ovary but prior to the achievement of fertilisation. This approach allowed relating several morphological and physiological pistil parameters in the dissected styles and stigmas to the subsequent set or abscission of the corresponding ovary that remained in the plant. Under the same pollination conditions, the flowers that finally set a fruit show a larger stigmatic area and a higher number of pollen grains, pollen tubes growing along the style and xylem vessels surrounding the transmitting tissue than flowers that abscise before the establishment of fruit set. Furthermore, starch is present in the transmitting tissue of the style in all the flowers that develop into fruits but only in half of the flowers that abscise. The examined pistil traits established prior to fertilisation are related to flower fate, suggesting that the capacity of a flower to become a fruit could be preconditioned at anthesis. © 2009 Association of Applied Biologists.",Fruit set; Pollen grains; Pollen tubes; Starch; Stigma; Style,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549141680

These 65 self-incompatible populations were evaluated in four environments with each entry plot surrounded by wheat plots on four sides. Inoculation with a pathogen mixture was done thrice during flowering and harvesting was done early by hand. Resistance traits were ergot incidence and severity. Logit-transformed data were subjected to analyses of variance. The lowest disease severity in any environment was 0.18%, and that was still higher than the official threshold of 0.1% for feed. In the pooled analysis across environments, significant genotypic differences as well as genotype × environment interaction were present. The correlation between ergot severity and pollen shedding was not significant indicating that genotypic differences were not affected by pollen shedding. Broad-sense heritability (h2) estimates were moderate (0.54-0.65). 'Halo', an old German cultivar, and the genetic resources 'Schmidt-Roggen' and 'Dukat', had low ergot severity (Halo having the lowest severity) as well as low disease incidence.

They include annual and perennial herbs, arching shrubs and trees up to 30 m tall. Presumed sister to all other Asteraceae, its intergeneric relationships are key to understanding the early evolution of the family. Results of the only molecular study on the subfamily conflict with relationships inferred from morphology. We investigate inter- and intrageneric relationships in Barnadesioideae with novel DNA sequence data and morphological characters using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian inference. All results verify Barnadesioideae as monophyletic and sister to the rest of the family. A basal split within the subfamily is recognized, with Chuquiraga, Doniophyton and Duseniella in one clade, and Arnaldoa, Barnadesia, Dasyphyllum, Fulcaldea, Huarpea and possibly Schlechtendalia in another. The largest genus, Dasyphyllum, is revealed as biphyletic with the two clades separating along subgeneric and geographic lines. Schlechtendalia, suggested as the earliest diverging lineage of the subfamily by morphological studies and parsimony analyses, is found in a more derived position under model-based inference methods. Competing phylogenetic hypotheses, both previous and present, are evaluated using likelihood-based tests. Evolutionary trends within Barnadesioideae are inferred: hummingbird pollination has developed convergently at least three times. An early vicariance in the subfamily's distribution is revealed.

In polluted air masses, signals may travel shorter distances before being destroyed by chemical reactions with pollutants, thus losing their specificity. To determine which scent-mediated interactions are likely to be affected, we review existing literature to build a picture of what chemicals are commonly found in such interactions and the spatial scales at which interactions occur. We find that pollination, attraction of natural enemies of plant pests, aggregation pheromones, and mate attraction are likely to be affected. We review the scant literature on this topic and extend the hypothesis to include heretofore unexplored interactions. New research should investigate whether air pollution deleteriously affects populations of organisms that rely on scent plumes. Additionally, we need to investigate whether or not breakdown products created by the reaction of signaling chemicals with pollutants can provide usable signals, and whether or not there has been adaptation on the part of scent emitters or receivers to use either breakdown products or more robust chemical signals.

Because interaction of floral herbivores and pollinators occurs when herbivores attack the flowers in the bud and flower stages and because the compensatory ability of plants is known to differ according to the timing of herbivory, the effects of herbivory may differ according to its timing. In this study, we investigated the effects of floral herbivory at different stages on fruit production and seed/ovule ratio at two sites of large populations of the perennial herb, Iris gracilipes for 2 years. Herbivory at the bud and fruit stages both tended to have negative effects on fruit production, but the former caused more severe damage. On the other hand, herbivory at the flower stage tended not to have negative effects on fruit production because the degree of flower loss was smaller in the flower stage. Although herbivory decreased fruit production, flowers did not compensate for the damage by increasing the seed/ovule ratio because reproduction of I. gracilipes was limited by pollen availability rather than resources.

The tobacco stigma is wet and covered by a thick layer of glycoprotein exudate at anthesis. The exudate contains abundant vesicles, which are densely labeled with calcium precipitates. When pollen grains arrive at the stigma, become hydrated, and as the pollen swells, Ca2+ precipitates accumulate at the aperture. Calcium precipitates that accumulate in pollen cytoplasm are initially concentrated within small vacuoles, but as germination proceeds these appear to fuse, forming prominent, densely labeled vesicles that preferentially accumulate near the proximal region of the growing tube. Although the stigma has abundant particles, few calcium precipitates are observed in the transmitting tissue from anthesis to 11 h after pollination. However, at 22 h after pollination, accumulation of calcium increases distally from the stigmatic interface with the transmitting tissue through the length of the style to the ovary. An examination of flowering plants with differing floral biology will be needed to understand the role of loosely bound calcium accumulation and its relationship to tissue-level changes in calcium uptake, maintenance of other calcium pools, including [Ca2+]cyt, and in pollen and style maturation during the progamic phase. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Calcium; Nicotiana tabacum; Pollen tube; Stigma; Style,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349084703

Conservation efforts adopted by land managers often consist of setting aside a portion of a dune system that is off-limits to OHV use, but little work has been done showing the extent to which this protects native bee communities. A two-year study of bee communities on a Great Basin sand dune complex in Dugway Proving Ground located in northwestern Utah revealed low similarity index values between closely situated collecting plots (1-40 km apart). Similarity values ranged from 0.13 to 0.70 for species composition, and from 0.07 to 0.57 when similarity was weighted by abundance. Distance between plots had no significant relationship to similarity when richness and abundance were considered. Bee similarity between plots was significantly correlated with floral similarity. These results indicate that dune conservation strategies that preserve ""representative"" portions of dune systems may be insufficient to protect bees and the pollination services they provide. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Apiformes; Beta diversity; Bray-Curtis similarity; Community composition; Hymenoptera; Utah,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64649083337

These fig wasps are often preyed upon by predatory ants. In this study, we found that predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) patrolling Ficus racemosa trees were attracted to the odour from fig syconia at different developmental phases, as well as to the odours of fig wasps, whereas other predatory ants (Technomyrmex albipes) responded only to odours of syconia from which fig wasps were dispersing and to fig wasp odour. However, trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) patrolling the same trees and exposed to the same volatiles were unresponsive to fig or fig wasp odours. The predatory ants demonstrated a concentration-dependent response towards volatiles from figs receptive to pollinators and those from which wasps were dispersing while the trophobiont-tending ants were unresponsive to such odours at all concentrations. Naïve predatory ants failed to respond to the volatiles to which the experienced predatory ants responded, indicating that the response to fig-related odours is learned. We suggest that predatory ants could use fig-associated volatiles to enhance their probability of wasp encounter and can eavesdrop on signals meant for pollinators. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",ant-plant interaction; associative learning; eavesdropping; mutualism; Myrmicaria brunnea; Oecophylla smaragdina; plant volatile; Technomyrmex albipes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349231973

Pollinator visitation is affected by various factors, and it is hypothesized that reproduction in non-rewarding plants would benefit from low spatial flower abundance and asynchronous flowering. In order to test this hypothesis, the influence of spatial pattern and flowering phenology on male and female reproductive success (RS) was investigated in a non-rewarding orchid, Cypripedium japonicum, in central China over two flowering seasons.MethodsThe probabilities of intrafloral self-pollination and geitonogamy caused by pollinator behaviours were estimated from field observations. Pollinator limitation was evaluated by hand-pollination experiments. RS was surveyed in different spatial flower dispersal patterns and local flower densities. The effects of flowering phenological traits on RS were assessed by univariate and multivariate regression analyses.Key ResultsHand-pollination experiments revealed that fruit production was strongly pollen limited throughout the entire reproductive season - over two seasons, 74·3 of individuals set fruit following hand pollination, but only 5·2-7·7 did so under natural conditions. Intrafloral self-pollination and geitonogamy within the potential clones might be rare. Both male and female fitness were substantially lower in clustered plants than in those growing singly. An increase in local conspecific flower density significantly and negatively influenced male RS, but had no effect on female RS. Phenotypic selection analysis indicated that individuals flowering earlier have the greatest probability of RS. Over 85 of sampled flowering individuals had a flowering synchrony value >0·7; however, highly synchronous flowering was not advantageous for RS, as indicated by the negative directional selection differentials and gradients, and by the positive quadratic selection gradients.ConclusionsThese results support the hypothesis that, as a consequence of density-dependent selection, low spatio-temporal flower abundance is advantageous for attracting pollinators and for reproduction in natural populations of non-rewarding C. japonicum.",Cypripedium japonicum; Deceptive flower; Flowering synchrony; Pollen limitation; Reproductive success; Selection differential; Selection gradient; Spatial dispersal pattern,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249094171

It is a particularly important and increasing threat to the managed honeybee colonies, which are vital in crop pollination. Artificial selection for disease-resistant honeybee genotypes has previously only been carried out at the colony-level, that is, by using queens or males reared from colonies that show resistance. However, honeybee queens mate with many males and so each colony consists of multiple patrilines that will vary in heritable traits, such as disease resistance. Here, we investigate whether response to artificial selection for a key resistance mechanism, hygienic behaviour, can be improved using multi-level selection, that is, by selecting not only among colonies as normal but also among patrilines within colonies. Highly hygienic colonies were identified (between-colony selection), and the specific patrilines within them responsible for most hygienic behaviour were determined using observation hives. Queens reared from these hygienic patrilines (within-colony selection) were identified using DNA microsatellite analysis of a wing-tip tissue sample and then mated to drones from a third highly hygienic colony. The resulting colonies headed by queens from hygienic patrilines showed approximately double the level of hygienic behaviour of colonies headed by sister queens from non-hygienic patrilines. The results show that multi-level selection can significantly improve the success of honeybee breeding programs. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Apis mellifera; Artificial selection; Breeding; Parasite; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349161550

Here we test the hypotheses that habitat fragmentation (a) alters the relative contribution of tree species exhibiting different reproductive traits; (b) reduces the diversity of pollination systems; and (c) facilitates the functional convergence of reproductive traits between edge-affected and early-secondary forest habitats (5-32 years old). This study was carried out in a severely fragmented 670-km2 forest landscape of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil. We assigned 35 categories of reproductive traits to 3552 trees (DBH ? 10 cm) belonging to 179 species, which described their pollination system, floral biology, and sexual system. Trait abundance was calculated for 55 plots of 0.1 ha across four habitats: forest edges, small forest fragments (3.4-83.6 ha), second-growth patches, and core tracts of forest interior within the largest available primary forest fragment (3500 ha) in the region. Edge-affected and secondary habitats showed a species-poor assemblage of trees exhibiting particular pollination systems, a reduced diversity of pollination systems, a higher abundance of reproductive traits associated with pollination by generalist diurnal vectors, and an elevated abundance of hermaphroditic trees. As expected, the reproductive signature of tree assemblages in forest edges and small fragments (edge-affected habitats), which was very similar to that of early second-growth patches, was greatly affected by both habitat type and plot distance to the nearest forest edge. In hyper-fragmented Atlantic forest landscapes, we predict that narrow forest corridors and small fragments will become increasingly dominated by edge-affected habitats that can no longer retain the full complement of tree life-history diversity and its attendant mutualists. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular understanding of the genetic factors regulating inflorescence architecture from the model system of Arabidopsis could provide critical insights for addressing this developmental process/pathway in a closely related crop species like Brassica napus L. Towards this objective, we have isolated and characterized the orthologs of the homeobox gene BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP) in three Brassica species, B. napus (BnBP), Brassica rapa L. (BrBP), and Brassica oleracea L. (BoBP). These Brassica orthologs show a high degree of conservation at the nucleotide and amino acid level, including the homeodomain and the intron positions. The B. napus ortholog complemented the Arabidopsis bp null allele and overexpression of BnBP in B. napus transgenic lines resulted in altered leaf phenotypes. Together, these results suggest that Brassica BP genes are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis BP. Ectopic expression of AS2, a negative regulator of BP encoding a LOB domain transcription factor, in transgenic B. napus produced compact inflorescence architecture reminiscent of the loss-of-function bp mutant phenotype described previously in Arabidopsis. These results provide evidence in support of BP as a potential target gene for modifying inflorescence architecture in Brassica crop species.",Architecture; ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2; Brassica; BREVIPEDICELLUS; Homeobox genes; Inflorescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149107579

We found that there is a major disparity between the ecological processes and stages of life history with large demographic impacts and the focus of empirical research on plants in fragmented habitats. While the growth and survivorship of large, established individuals have the highest elasticity values, the focus of empirical research has been on components of reproduction and seedling dynamics.

In plants, the evolution of flowering phenology is often interpreted as the response to selection from mutualists, although antagonistic interactions may also be important. We examined direct and indirect phenotypic selection on the start of flowering via mutualistic and antagonistic interactions in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus over 7 years. Flowering start influenced seed set, predispersal seed predation, and risk of grazing. These effects were in opposed directions and partly influenced different components of fitness. Combining information about effects on fitness components with information about links between fitness components and average lifetime fitness, in terms of population growth rate, showed that earlier flowering was associated with higher lifetime fitness in all years. These relationships were, however, mediated largely by variation in flower number, and direct selection on first flowering date was more variable among years. We conclude that long-term studies correcting for indirect selection and environmental covariance are needed to understand selection on reproductive phenology and that demographic approaches are necessary to assess selection mediated by several agents and influencing several components of fitness. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Flowering phenology; Herbivory; Matrix models; Phenotypic selection; Pollination; Timing of reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650233942

Genomic in situ hybridization analysis revealed that pollen mother cells at diakinesis of As1 contained 26 bivalents comprising 19 from B. napus and 7 from I. indigotica and mainly showed the segregation 26:26 at anaphase I (AI) with 7 I. indigotica chromosomes in each polar group. Four BC1 plants from As1 after pollinated by B. napus resembled mainly B. napus in morphology but also exhibited some characteristics from I. indigotica. These plants produced some seeds on selfing or pollination by B. napus. They had 2n = 45 (AACCI) and underwent pairing among the I. indigotica chromosomes and/or between the chromosomes of two parents at diakinesis. All hybrids mainly had the AFLP banding patterns from the addition of two parents plus some alterations. B. napus contributed chloroplast genomes in majority of the hybrids but some also had from I. indigotica. Production of B. napus-I. indigotica additions would be of considerable importance for genome analysis and breeding. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Chloroplast genome; Intertribal hybrids; Isatis indigotica; Somatic hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650678182

Clonally propagated parents and their half-sib families were grown as spaced single plants using a randomized complete-block design with three replications, and observed for seven traits in 2006 and 2007. The estimates of broad-sense heritability (hn2) were moderate to high (hb2= 0.43 - 0.80) for the traits studied. Narrow-sense heritability (n2) estimates from analyses of progenies and from regression of half-sib (HS) progenies on parents (h op2) suggested that genetic variation for these traits was largely controlled by additive gene action. Association of dry matter yield (DMY) with plant height, number of fertile shoot, curbs width and spring growth was positive and significant. With the exception of number of days to pollination, correlation coefficients of the traits between the parents and offspring were not significant. Based on parent-offspring regression, genetic gain from selection for DMY was high, demonstrating genetic potential for improving this trait. Overall, there was high genetic variation and moderate heritability for most traits in the tall fescue populations evaluated. In conclusion, to improve herbage yield, selection would be more effective based on forage yield components. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Combining ability; Heritability; Phenotypic correlation; Tall fescue,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349118093

To gain insight into this problem, we have compared differences in floral and vegetative volatiles between two closely related plant species with different life histories. The self-pollinating annual, Arabidopsis thaliana, and its relative, the outcrossing perennial, Arabidopsis lyrata, have markedly divergent life cycles and breeding systems. We show that these differences are in part reflected in the formation of distinct volatile mixtures in flowers and foliage. Volatiles emitted from flowers of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population are dominated by benzenoid compounds in contrast to the previously described sesquiterpene-dominated emissions of A. thaliana flowers. Flowers of A. lyrata ssp. petraea release benzenoid volatiles in a diurnal rhythm with highest emission rates at midday coinciding with observed visitations of pollinating insects. Insect feeding on leaves of A. lyrata ssp. petraea causes a variable release of the volatiles methyl salicylate, C11- and C16-homoterpenes, nerolidol, plus the sesquiterpene (E)-?-caryophyllene, which in A. thaliana is emitted exclusively from flowers. An insect-induced gene (AlCarS) with high sequence similarity to the florally expressed (E)-?-caryophyllene synthase (AtTPS21) from A. thaliana was identified from individuals of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population. Recombinant AlCarS converts the sesquiterpene precursor, farnesyl diphosphate, into (E)-?-caryophyllene with ?-humulene and ?-copaene as minor products indicating its close functional relationship to the A. thaliana AtTPS21. Differential regulation of these genes in flowers and foliage is consistent with the different functions of volatiles in the two Arabidopsis species. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Arabidopsis; Diurnal volatile emission; Herbivory; Terpene synthase; Terpenoid; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63649115376

We surveyed Platanthera bifolia populations from six regions in northeastern Poland to determine the impact of the mating system and population history on genetic diversity. Based on variation at allozyme markers, genetic variation was relatively moderate (P=22.3%, A=1.48, H O=0.083, F IS=-0.015) and similar to other Platanthera species. These parameters varied between populations (P=13.3%-26.6%, A=1.26-1.66, H O=0.055-0.111, F IS=-0.262- 0.147). The genetic diversity patterns were shaped by different proportions of facilitated selfing and/or outcrossing, resulting in positive and negative F IS values, respectively.

The relatively low level of genetic differentiation among the investigated regions (F CT=0.002, P&gt;0.05) and among populations (F ST=0.048, P&lt;0.001), and the lack of a significant relationship between genetic and geographical distance, are discussed in the context of possible scenaria of postglacial expansion. © 2009 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.",Allozymes; Hand pollination; Inbreeding; Orchids; Protected species; Selfing; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449144451

Though several Phytophthora spp. are known to attack walnut, P. cinnamomi is considered the most virulent and widespread in southern Europe. Up to now, no walnut species or hybrid is known to have a high resistance level towards P. cinnamomi. Efforts are addressed in finding rootstock material graft compatible with English walnut and resistant/tolerant to P. cinnamomi. The extension of P. cinnamomi lesions on five Juglans species was studied to find out sources of resistance/tolerance to this pathogen. Walnut species clustered into two main groups, J. hindsii, J. nigra, and J. mandshurica were the less susceptible to the colonization of P. cinnamomi, while J. regia and J. sieboldiana were the most susceptible. On this account, J. mandshurica represents the best alternative as rootstock because its employment overcomes the risk of the occurrence of black line disease, it has good level of resistance to Agrobacterium temefaciens and Brenneria nigrifluens, and it is tolerant to Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis. J. mandshurica is also compatible in cross-pollinations with J. regia and J. nigra. Differences in virulence of P. cinnamomi isolates was assessed and a marked interaction between species and isolate emerged. Treatment with fosetyl-Al by dipping was mainly efficient in reducing the length P. cinnamomi lesions, and an interaction between species and treatment was evident with the highest efficacy on J. regia and J. sieboldiana. © 2008 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449163775

We tested the hypothesis that gravity controls seed development via modulation of gases around the developing seeds, by studying how hypergravity affects the silique microenvironment and seed development. Using an in vitro silique maturation system, we sampled internal silique gases for 16d late in the seed maturation sequence at 4g or 1g. The carbon dioxide level was significantly higher inside the 4-g siliques, and the immature seeds became heavier than those maturing at 1g. Pollination and early embryo development were also studied by growing whole plants at 2g or 4g for 16d inside chambers mounted on a large-diameter centrifuge. Each day the rotor was briefly stopped to permit manual pollination of flowers, thereby producing cohorts of same-aged siliques for comparison with stationary control material. The loss of starch and soluble carbohydrates during seed development was accelerated in hypergravity, with seeds developing at 4g more advanced by 2d than those at 1g. Seeds produced at 4g contained more lipid than those at 1g. Taken together, these results indicate that hypergravity enhances gas availability to the developing embryos. Gravity's role in seed development is of importance to the space programme because of the plan to use plants for food production and habitat regeneration in extraterrestrial settings. These results are significant because they underscore the tight co-regulation of Brassica seed development and the atmosphere maintained inside the siliques. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",Brassica rapa; Embryo development; Gravity; Hypergravity; Internal atmosphere; Seed production; Storage reserves,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349134862

We assessed the factors significant in understanding the distribution of Z. palustris and the surrounding macrophyte community. Sixty historic wild rice wetlands that currently display a wide range of rice densities were sampled in Wisconsin and Minnesota (USA). Chemical and physical factors and aquatic plants densities were measured. Data were analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis in which the following trends were found. Wetlands that exhibited the greatest loss of Zizania tended to have higher levels of residential development within their watershed, ammonia, pH and depth. The aquatic plant community also shifted to plants that likely benefited from increases in light and pollinators. Increased agriculture was correlated with higher nutrient levels and increases with floating plants that can acquire nutrients directly from the water column. This study suggests optimal conditions for wild rice as well as the aquatic plant communities that are associated with these conditions. This paper demonstrates that Zizania (and other aquatic plants) may be very sensitive to small changes within their watershed that are typical of moderate development. Future management strategies should include consideration of these land-use patterns. © 2009, The Society of Wetland Scientists.",Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA); Disturbance; Management; Watershed modification; Wetlands,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77749246139

We have found that the SI response in S. carolinense is a plastic trait-its strength being affected by the age of the flowers, and the presence of developing fruits and that there are genetic differences among families in their self-fertility. However, in species with a fully functional SI response, selfing would not be that common. As a result, deleterious recessives scattered though the genome of horsenettle are only occasionally exposed to selection. It has been suggested that deleterious recessives accumulate near S-alleles in strong SI species because the S-locus is located in a non-recombining region of the genome and because strong S-alleles are never in the homozygous state, thus sheltering some of the genetic load near the S-locus from selection. We performed a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments to determine the extent to which sheltered load adds to the overall magnitude of inbreeding depression in horsenettle. Specifically, we amplified and sequenced the S-alleles from 16 genets collected from a large population in Pennsylvania and performed a series of controlled self-pollinations. We then grew the selfed progeny in the greenhouse; recorded various measures of growth and reproductive output; and amplified and sequenced their S-allele(s). We found that the heterozygous progeny of self-pollinations produce more flowers and have a greater ability to set both self and cross seed than S-homozygous progeny. We also found evidence of variation in the magnitude of load among S-alleles. These results suggest that sheltered load might slow the fixation of weak (partially compatible) S-alleles in this population, thus adding to the maintenance of a mixed mating system rather than leading to the fixation of the selfing alleles. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Breakdown in self-incompatibility; Inbreeding depression; Sheltered load; Solanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349127956

Judging the maturity of young coconut is difficult and thus a harvested crop typically features fruit of varying levels of maturity, which currently require manual grading. In an attempt to help reduce the time and costs associated with the grading process, the correlations between the physical, mechanical, physiological and acoustic properties of coconuts and their maturity levels were investigated. The analyses showed that specific gravity, husk rupture force and husk firmness showed a decreasing trend with progressing days after pollination. Other properties including resonant frequency, shell rupture force, shell firmness, total soluble solids, flesh thickness, wet flesh weight and dry flesh weight indicated an increase in values with days after pollination. The flesh thickness was the parameter best correlated with days after pollination. Maturity index based on the flesh thickness can be quantitatively predicted by multivariate partial least squares model. The best model used a combination of husk rupture force, shell firmness, shell rupture force, wet flesh weight and husk firmness (R2 = 0.991, standard error of prediction of 0.133 and bias of 0.004).

Analyses demonstrated that seeds of the winter variety (Kana, Pomorzanin) were characterized by a higher technological value than those of the spring variety (Bios) due to a higher mass of 1000 seeds and oil content and a lower concentration of phosphorus compounds, including non-hydratable phospholipids. The highest nutritive value was demonstrated for oil processed from seeds of the winter hybrid variety Pomorzanin as it was characterized by the most optimal ratios of n-6 and n-3 acids.

Different batteries of floral features attract different pollinators and may achieve specific relationships that are essential for the immediate plant reproductive success, and at an evolutionary time scale have been of vital importance in the radiation of Angiosperms. We have found that mutualistic services by ants, insects traditionally considered ineffective pollinators, are essential for the pollination of Cytinus hypocistis (Cytinaceae), a Mediterranean root holoparasitic plant. Diverse floral signals, mainly nectar characteristics and floral scent could be playing a key role in the attraction of different species of ants, which pollinate effectively the flowers. Surprisingly, the abundance of other insects foraging in this parasite was very low and, although this scarcity could be due in part to the presence of ants, we suggest that different floral features exhibited by C. hypocistis could be evolving for attracting ants. Based on some current findings, we suspect that the study of floral signals in Cytinaceae is critical in the understanding the divergence of pollination systems in this fascinating family of parasitic plants. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Ant; Cytinaceae; Cytinus hypocistis; Floral signal; Nectar; Plant-animal interaction; Scent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650109887

Asymptomatic airway hyperreactivity in allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for later development of asthma. Although non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) has been measured by several stimuli, the most appropriate measurement technique still remains unclear. Objective. To investigate whether an exercise challenge can be used to predict BHR in seasonal allergic rhinitis patients with or without asthma and to compare this bronchial reactivity with a methacholine challenge technique. Methods. Forty-six consecutive patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis only (n = 31) and with both seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma (n = 15) were included in the study during the pollination period. Subjects underwent first methacholine (mch) and then exercise challenge testing (ECT). There was a 1-week interval between the tests. ECT was performed on a bicycle ergometer. Positive result was defined as a 15% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) post-exercise. A patient's bronchial reactivity to methacholine was considered as hyperresponsive if PC20 was less than 8 mg/mL. Results. Mch PC20 values were significantly lower in patients with both rhinitis and asthma (p 0.062). Among the 46 patients, mch PC20 values were significantly different between patients who had positive and negative exercise challenge tests (p = 0.007). All patients with rhinitis alone had a negative ECT and 10 had a positive mch challenge. Change in FEV1 values after ECT was significantly higher in patients with both rhinitis and asthma compared to those with rhinitis alone (p = 0.009). There was a significant relation between positivity of mch and exercise challenges (p = 0.025). ECT positivity was found to be a significant confounding factor in the diagnosis of asthma (p = 0.001). Specificity and sensitivity values were 100% and 24% for ECT and 68% and 100% for mch, respectively. Conclusion. Exercise challenge presents poor diagnostic value for detecting bronchial responsiveness in individuals with allergic rhinitis alone during the pollen season.",Asthma; Bronchial challenge testing; Bronchial hyperresponsiveness; Exercise; Methacholine; Seasonal rhinitis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650302904

However, the genetic mode of resistance in S. nigrum is still poorly understood. In the present study, two S. nigrum accessions, 984750019 (N19) and #13, resistant (R) and susceptible (S), respectively, to three different isolates of P. infestans, were sexually crossed. The various kinds of progeny including F1, F2, F3, and backcross populations (BC1; F1 × S), as well as two populations produced by self-pollinating the R parent and S parent, were each screened for susceptibility to P. infestans isolate MP 324 using detached leaf assays. Fifty seedling plant individuals of the F1 progeny were each resistant to this specific isolate, similarly to the seedling plants resulting from self-pollination of the resistant R parent. Thirty seedling plants obtained from self-pollination of the S parent were susceptible. Among a total of 180 F2 plants, the segregation ratio between resistant and susceptible plants was approximately 3: 1. Among the 66 seedling plants of the BC1 progeny originating from crossing an F1 plant with the susceptible S parent, there were 26 susceptible and 40 resistant plants to P. infestans. The segregation patterns obtained indicated monogenic dominant inheritance of resistance to P. infestans isolate MP 324 in S. nigrum acc. 984750019.

Thirty-one CDPK genes have been identified in the rice genome by a complete search of the genome based upon HMM profiles. In this study, the expression of this gene family was analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array in three rice cultivars: Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and their hybrid Shanyou 63 independently. Twenty-seven tissues sampled throughout the entire rice life-span were studied, along with three hormone treatments (GA3, NAA and KT), applied to the seedling at the trefoil stage. All 31 genes were found to be expressed in at least one of the experimental stages studied and revealed diverse expression patterns. We identified differential expression of the OsCPK genes in the stamen (1 day before flowering), the panicle (at the heading stage), the endosperm (days after pollination) and also in callus, in all three cultivars. Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, OsCPK12, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage. The OsCPK genes were also found to be regulated in rice seedlings subjected to different hormone treatment conditions, however their expression were not the same for all varieties.

Honey bee declines could reflect increased pressures from parasites and pathogens. The incidence of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema ceranae has increased significantly in the past decade. Here we present a draft assembly (7.86 MB) of the N. ceranae genome derived from pyrosequence data, including initial gene models and genomic comparisons with other members of this highly derived fungal lineage. N. ceranae has a strongly AT-biased genome (74% A+T) and a diversity of repetitive elements, complicating the assembly. Of 2,614 predicted protein-coding sequences, we conservatively estimate that 1,366 have homologs in the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi, the most closely related published genome sequence. We identify genes conserved among microsporidia that lack clear homology outside this group, which are of special interest as potential virulence factors in this group of obligate parasites. A substantial fraction of the diminutive N. ceranae proteome consists of novel and transposableelement proteins. For a majority of well-supported gene models, a conserved sense-strand motif can be found within 15 bases upstream of the start codon; a previously uncharacterized version of this motif is also present in E. cuniculi. These comparisons provide insight into the architecture, regulation, and evolution of microsporidian genomes, and will drive investigations into honey bee-Nosema interactions.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650930861

The spores infect flowers on the day of pollination, resulting in hardlock, which is the failure of the fiber to fluff as the boll opens at maturity. Frankliniella spp. Thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) inhabiting the flowers are hypothesized to increase hardlock by spreading the conidia or by creating entranceways for the germinating Fusarium conidia. Experiments were conducted at Marianna and Quincy in Florida in 2006 and 2007 to determine whether there was a relationship between the number of adult and larval thrips inhabiting the flowers of cotton and the incidence of cotton hardlock. Frankliniella tritici (Fitch) was >98% of the adult thrips in the samples at both locations each year. The adults of Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) also were collected. There were no significant regression relationships between weekly mean densities of thrips in the flowers and the incidence of cotton hardlock at harvest in any of the experiments. Additional experiments were conducted at each location in 2006 and 2007 to determine whether weekly applications during flowering of the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin, the fungicide thiophanate methyl, and the combination of the two reduced the incidence of cotton hardlock at harvest. Applications of the insecticide significantly reduced the numbers of adult F. tritici, the number of thrips larvae, and the incidence of hardlock at harvest. Applications of the insecticide were as affective as applications of the insecticide plus fungicide. In one experiment, applications of the fungicide reduced the incidence of hardlock at harvest. Applications of the insecticide usually significantly increased the number of adult F. occidentalis. None of the pesticide treatments significantly affected the numbers of the key thrips predator Orius insidiosus (Say).

Flowers of Petunia integrifolia emit mostly benzaldehyde, while flowers of Petunia axillaris subsp. axillaris emit a mixture of volatile benzenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds that include isoeugenol and eugenol. Flowers of the artificial hybrid Petunia hybrida, a cross between P. integrifolia and P. axillaris, emit a similar spectrum of volatiles as P. axillaris subsp. axillaris. However, the flowers of P. axillaris subsp. parodii emit neither isoeugenol nor eugenol but contain high levels of dihydroconiferyl acetate in the petals, the main scent-synthesizing and scent-emitting organs. We recently showed that both isoeugenol and eugenol in P. hybrida are biosynthesized from coniferyl acetate in reactions catalyzed by isoeugenol synthase (PhIGS1) and eugenol synthase (PhEGS1), respectively, via a quinone methide-like intermediate. Here we show that P. axillaris subsp. parodii has a functional EGS gene that is expressed in flowers, but its IGS gene contains a frame-shift mutation that renders it inactive. Despite the presence of active EGS enzyme in P. axillaris subsp. parodii, in the absence of IGS activity the coniferyl acetate substrate is converted by an as yet unknown enzyme to dihydroconiferyl acetate. By contrast, suppressing the expression of PhIGS1 in P. hybrida by RNA interference also leads to a decrease in isoeugenol biosynthesis, but instead of the accumulation of dihydroconiferyl acetate, the flowers synthesize higher levels of eugenol. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Evolution; Petunia; Plant volatile; Pollination; Scent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66949177294

Such temporal variation may have significant ecological and evolutionary consequences, but it has rarely been studied, and the mechanisms that mediate temporal variation have almost never been investigated. We tested for variation in the proportion of seeds self-fertilized (s) between two years within 19 populations of the short-lived herb Aquilegia canadensis. Selfing varied widely among populations (range in s 1/4 0.17-1.00, mean s 1/4 0.82) but was inconsistent across years, indicating significant temporal variation. Three populations exhibited especially wide swings in the mating system between years. Mean s did not decrease with increasing population size (N), nor was the fluctuation in s associated with mean N or the change in N. As expected, s declined with increasing separation between anthers and stigmas within flowers (herkogamy), and s fluctuated to a greater extent in populations with more herkogamous flowers. Self-compatible plants can experience wide temporal variation in self-fertilization, and floral traits such as herkogamy may mediate temporal variation by forestalling self-pollination and thus allowing outcrossing during periods when pollinators are frequent. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Aquilegia canadensis; Floral morphology; Herkogamy; Inbreeding; Mating system variation; Outcrossing; Population size; Self-fertilization; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449156118

The present study investigates cellular aspects of the pollen-pistil interaction after compatible and incompatible pollinations of Psychotria nuda, to increase our knowledge of heteromorphic self-incompatibility (HetSI). The use of bright field, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy methods allowed us to demonstrate that pollen tubes behave differently after incompatible and compatible pollinations. Pollen tubes were particularly distinct after incompatible pollinations of L- and S-morph flowers. Relative to compatible pollen tubes, incompatible L-morph tubes had a drastic reduction in cellular contents, but no cell rupture. Incompatible S-morph tubes exhibited dense cytoplasm in apical regions, as well as in other regions, accompanied by a rupture of the apex. These results support the hypothesis that L- and S-morph flowers have different incompatibility mechanisms during HetSI. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Heteromorphic self-incompatibility system; Pollen tube growth; Pollen ultrastructure; Pollen-pistil interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349869266

The main cause of the decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification. Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied bumble bees in allotment gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals) decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee species. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that allotment gardens and other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in areas strongly influenced by human activity. © 2009 Ahrné et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65949087029

In this study, we tested a male- and female-sterility (MS; FS) gene construct in Nicotiana tabacum to evaluate its effectiveness and effect on phenotype. Three T1 Nicotiana tabacum lines expressing the MS (p108:barnase) and FS (sp41:barnase) genes (MS/FS lines) and a control Nicotiana tabacum line (WT GUS) were measured for plant height, leaf length and width, corolla length, number of nodes on the main stem and stem diameter. No significant differences were found in these growth measurements between MS/FS lines and WT GUS. No pollen was observed on any of the lines carrying the MS and FS genes, indicating that the male sterility was complete. Seed set was greatly reduced or completely eliminated in plants with the MS and FS genes, after heavy pollinations of mature flowers with WT GUS pollen. However, pollinations of immature flowers resulted in very low seed set. This may be due to the nature of the promoter controlling expression of the FS gene as it had the highest expression levels at anthesis. The combination of male- and female-sterility genes was effective in eliminating seed set in all the lines examined and has direct application for reducing invasiveness of ornamental plants. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Interactions with animals as pollinators or seed dispersers have long been suspected as drivers of angiosperm diversification, yet empirical examples remain sparse or inconclusive. Seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) may drive diversification as it can reduce extinction by providing selective advantages to plants and can increase speciation by enhancing geographical isolation by extremely limited dispersal distances. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the most comprehensive sister-group comparison to date, we tested the hypothesis that myrmecochory leads to higher diversification rates in angiosperm plants. As predicted, diversification rates were substantially higher in ant-dispersed plants than in their non-myrmecochorous relatives. Data from 101 angiosperm lineages in 241 genera from all continents except Antarctica revealed that ant-dispersed lineages contained on average more than twice as many species as did their non-myrmecochorous sister groups. Contrasts in species diversity between sister groups demonstrated that diversification rates did not depend on seed dispersal mode in the sister group and were higher in myrmecochorous lineages in most biogeographic regions. Conclusions/Significance: Myrmecochory, which has evolved independently at least 100 times in angiosperms and is estimated to be present in at least 77 families and 11 000 species, is a key evolutionary innovation and a globally important driver of plant diversity. Myrmecochory provides the best example to date for a consistent effect of any mutualism on large-scale diversification. © 2009 Lengyel et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-66049109836

Activation of stigma-expressed S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) [1] by pollen coat-localized S-locus cysteine-rich (SCR) ligand [2-5] and the resulting rejection of pollen occurs only if receptor and ligand are encoded by the same S haplotype [4, 6-8]. To identify residues within the SRK extracellular domain (eSRK) that are required for its ligand-selective activation, we assayed chimeric receptors and receptor variants containing substitutions at polymorphic sites in Arabidopsis thaliana [9, 10]. We show that only a small number of the ?100 polymorphic residues in eSRK are required for ligand-specific activation of self-incompatibility in vivo. These essential residues occur in two noncontiguous clusters located at equivalent positions in the two variants tested. They also correspond to sites showing elevated levels of substitutions in other SRKs, suggesting that these residues could define self-incompatibility specificity in most SRKs. The results demonstrate that the majority of eSRK residues that show signals of positive selection and previously surmised to function as specificity determinants are not essential for specificity in the SRK-SCR interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In situ hybridization experiments revealed that a tissue-specific gradient of IAA9 expression is established during flower development, the release of which upon pollination triggers the initiation of fruit development. Comparative transcriptome and targeted metabolome analysis uncovered important features of the molecular events underlying pollination-induced and pollination-independent fruit set. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling identified a high number of genescommonto both types of fruit set,amongwhich only a small subset are dependent on IAA9 regulation. The fine-tuning of Aux/IAA and ARF genes and the downregulation of TAG1 and TAGL6 MADS box genes are instrumental in triggering the fruit set program.

However, while these hormones affected only a small number of transcriptional events, dramatic shifts were observed at the metabolic and developmental levels. The activation of photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism-related genes is an integral regulatory component of fruit set process.

Key Results Cytinus hypocistis is a self-compatible monoecious species that relies on insects for seed production. Ants were the main visitors, accounting for 97·4 of total floral visits, and exclusion experiments showed that they act as true pollinators. They consistently touched reproductive organs, carried large pollen loads and transported viable pollen, although the different ant species observed in the flowers differed in their pollination effectiveness. The abundance of flying visitors was surprisingly low, and only the fly Oplisa aterrima contributed to fruit production and cross-pollination. Conclusions Mutualistic services by ant are essential for the pollination of Cytinus hypocistis. Although this parasite does not exhibit typical features of the 'ant-pollination syndrome', many other characteristics indicate that it is evolving to a more specialized ant-pollination system. The striking interspecific differences in the pollination systems of Mediterranean Cytinus (ant-pollinated) and some South African Cytinus (mammal-pollinated) make this genus an excellent model to investigate the divergent evolution of pollination systems in broadly disjunct areas.",Ant; Breeding system; Cytinaceae; Cytinus hypocistis; Flies; Insects; Mediterranean Basin; Parasitic plant; Pollination; Rafflesiaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349125478

This plant-centred approach provides insufficient information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant-pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant-pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four modules were far from isolated. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdCNRS.",Apparent specialization; Coevolution; Generalization; Modularity; Nestedness; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollen analysis; Pollination web; Sampling effort,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64149130965

Yet, the causes of selection on flowering phenology and traits contributing to floral display have rarely been tested experimentally in natural populations. We quantified phenotypic selection on morphological and phenological characters in the perennial, outcrossing herb Arabidopsis lyrata in two years using female reproductive success as a proxy of fitness. To determine whether selection on floral display and flowering phenology can be attributed to interactions with pollinators, selection was quantified both for open-pollinated controls and for plants receiving supplemental hand-pollination. We documented directional selection for many flowers, large petals, late start of flowering, and early end of flowering. Seed output was pollen-limited in both years and supplemental hand-pollination reduced the magnitude of selection on number of flowers, and reversed the direction of selection on end of flowering. The results demonstrate that interactions with pollinators may affect the strength of selection on floral display and the direction of selection on phenology of flowering in natural plant populations. They thus support the contention that pollinators can drive the evolution of both floral display and flowering time. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Floral display; Flower size; Flowering phenology; Natural selection; Pollen limitation; Selection gradients,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749106924

Pollination experiments, flower-visitor observations, nectar sampling, pollen transfer, and pollen to ovule ratio and pollen size studies were included in this project. The large, white flowers of this species set fruit via open pollination (55%), autonomous autogamy (51%), facilitated autogamy (91%), cross-pollination (80%), diurnal open pollination (60%) and nocturnal open pollination (60%). Fruit set is pollen-limited. Ants, beetles, crickets and hawk moths regularly visit the flowers. Ants are the most frequent visitors, but hawk moths are the only effective pollinators. Nectar is available throughout the night, but is most abundant early in the evening when hawk moth visits are most frequent. Experiments with fluorescent dust demonstrate intra- and inter-plant pollen movement by hawk moths. Although this species is adapted for hawk moth pollination, it readily sets fruit via autonomous autogamy when no visits are made. Thus, it is concluded that it is facultatively xenogamous. Additional support for this conclusion is provided by the pollen to ovule ratio of 1407 and by the fact that the plants grow in a region that has few or no faithful pollinators.

In the face of a potential worldwide pollination crisis it is important to assess which countries may be more vulnerable in order to prioritize pollinator conservation efforts. The poverty level, the population density and the level of pollinator dependence for food provisioning are key aspects to identify vulnerable countries. We evaluate these aspects and determine the level of human food provisioning dependence on pollinators in Mexico, a developing and highly populated country. The diversity of crop species in Mexico is exceptionally high. Nearly 85% of fruit and/or seed consumed species depend to some degree on pollinators for productivity. Overall, pollinator-dependent crops generate larger income but cover a lower cultivated area and produce less volume compared to non-pollinator-dependent crops. Volume per unit area, however, as well as revenue per unit area, is much higher for pollinator-dependent crops. Native wild pollinators also play a key role in fruit or seed production of Mexican domesticated plant species and in the reproduction of many useful wild species. Thus, assuring free pollination services is particularly important in Mexico as the livelihood of a large proportion of the population exclusively and directly depends on ecosystem services for subsistence. Feasible conservation strategies involve the payment of environmental services to Ejidos (communal land tenure systems) making efforts to protect or restore plant resources and native pollinators, and the creation of new protected natural areas, which ensures food provision, mating and nesting sites for pollinators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We also compared floral sex ratios, pollinator visitation rates, and pollen limitation of seed set from early to late in the season to determine whether these factors mirrored seasonal changes in pollen receipt and seed production.

Experimental manipulation of flowering plant density did not affect pollinator visitation rate, pollen receipt, or seed production. Although pollinator visitation rate increased 10-fold from early to late in the season, pollen receipt and seed set decreased over the season. Seed set was never pollen-limited.

It is well-known that the pollinator assemblage of particular species varies temporally and spatially, and therefore the ecological generalization on pollinators may be a contextual attribute. However, the factors causing such variation and its ecological and evolutionary consequences are still poorly understood. This variation can be caused by spatial or temporal variation in the pollinator community, but also by variation in the plant community. Here, we examined how the floral neighbourhood influenced the generalization on pollinators and the composition of pollinators of six plant species differing in generalization levels and main pollinators. The diversity, identity and density of floral species affected both the level of generalization on pollinators and the composition of visitors of particular plant species. Although the relationships to floral neighbourhood varied considerably among species, generalization level and visitation by uncommon pollinators generally increased with floral diversity and richness. The generalization level of the neighbourhood was negatively related to the generalization level of the focal species in two species. The number of flowers of the pollinator-sharing species and the number of flowers of the focal species had different effects on the composition of visits in different species; attributable to differences in facilitation/competition for pollinator attraction. We propose that an important ecological implication of our results is that variation in species interactions caused by the pollination context may result in increased community stability. The main evolutionary implication of our results is that selection on flower and pollinator traits may depend, to an unknown extent, on the composition of the co-flowering plant community. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449127074

The flowers mimic the behaviourally active compounds of the sex pheromone of receptive females and thus attract males that seek to copulate. Odour is the main attractant while visual stimuli have been assumed so far to play only a minor role. In contrast to most species of the genus, Heldreich's orchid Ophrys heldreichii, which is pollinated by males of the long-horned bee Tetralonia berlandi, possesses a bright pink perianth that appears conspicuous to a human observer. We investigated the role of this floral colour signal in pollinator attraction. We filmed approach flights of male bees to flowers in which we removed the original perianth and in which we substituted the perianth with an artificial one of a particular selected colour. At distances >30cm, male search time correlated only with wind speed but not with the spectral parameters of the perianth, i.e. chromatic and green receptor-specific contrast. By contrast, in the close range (<30cm), where the perianth subtends a visual angle of at least 5deg. to the bee's eye, search time decreased with increasing green receptor contrast between perianth and background; however, no correlation with chromatic contrast or wind speed was found. Our results indicate that pollinators are first attracted by olfactory signals from a distance. Once in the vicinity of the flower where spatial vision of the males is sufficient, they are guided exclusively by vision. However, it can be expected that possession of a 'non-private' colour signal would increase the risk of pollen loss in sexually deceptive orchids by accidentally attracting non-specific flower visitors. We therefore discuss the occurrence of colour signals in the genus Ophrys in respect to the species-specific visual system of the pollinators.",Colour vision; Ophrys heldreichii; Orchids; Pollination; Sexual deception; Signal evolution; Tetralonia berlandi,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149139293

The scarcity of mates and pollinators can lead plant populations to suffer from pollen limitation and a decrease in reproductive performance within fragmented areas. We studied the shift in pollinator assemblages along with pollen limitation and seed production patterns in the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis. Our study included six populations contrasting in patch and population size (Large vs. Small) within a fragmented landscape characterized by ?1% of potential forest coverage. The breeding system in Myrtus communis was self-compatible, but compared with natural pollination, fruit set increased with pollen addition (quantity limited), and seed set (brood size) increased with outcross pollen addition (quality limited). While the pollinator assemblage in Large patches was taxonomically diverse, it was almost monopolized by honeybees in Small patches, where visitation rates were highest and wild bee species were almost absent. In general, Small populations were less pollen limited for fruit set than Large populations, particularly those that received the highest rates of honeybee visits. However, despite differences in fragmentation and pollinators between Large and Small populations, seed production patterns (brood size and seed mass) were rather similar among them, in agreement with similar pollen limitation levels found for brood size. A higher susceptibility of native pollinators to the presence of honeybee hives was found in Small patches, suggesting that the pollinator assemblage may be severely altered when fragmentation occurs in combination with beekeeping.

Figs are hollow, rounded structures lined on the inside by numerous tiny flowers. To lay their eggs, female fig wasps enter the figs and typically walk around on a platform of stigmas (synstigma) from which they insert their ovipositors through the stigmas and down the styles before reaching the ovules, where they oviposit. Previous studies have described fig wasp oviposition behavior in those Ficus species with a synstigma and have related ovipositor lengths to style lengths accordingly. Here, we show that this oviposition pattern is not universal within Ficus and that variation in fig architecture leads to the modification of oviposition behavior. Figs of the monoecious Asian fig tree F. curtipes and relatives (subsection Conosycea) lack a synstigma, which is replaced by an irregular mass of elongate stigmas. The ovipositor of the pollinator Eupristina sp. is sufficiently long to reach all the ovules. Despite this, and unlike other fig wasps, they do not oviposit via the top of the stigmas, but insert their ovipositors through the stigmal bases.

Most information on coevolving interactions, however, comes from specialized organisms. In contrast, an accurate understanding of the effect of geographically varying evolutionary dynamics on the evolution of generalist organisms is lacking, although these kinds of organisms are the most frequent in nature. In flowering plants, pollinators and herbivores are important selective agents. In this study we investigate whether a geographic selection mosaic for floral traits in a generalist plant, Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae), can be mediated by the interplay of mutualistic and antagonistic interacting organisms. In eight populations we quantified the selection exerted by these organisms on several plant traits. We found significant spatial variation in pollinator assemblage. In different populations, the main pollinators belonged to different functional groups (beeflies, large bees, small bees, and beetles). Damage by ungulates also varied among populations. Consequently, we found that different populations were under different selective regimes, and the traits affected by selection depended on the local interaction intensity with pollinators and mammal herbivores. Some traits, such as flower number and stalk height, were selected similarly in most populations. Other traits, such as corolla diameter and tube length, were selected only in some populations. Finally, we found divergent selection for some traits, such as corolla tube width and corolla shape, which were selected in contrasting directions in different localities. This spatial variation in selective scenarios results in populations with strong selective regimes (hot spots) intermingled with populations with weak selective regimes (cold spots). Four important outcomes emerge from the E. mediohispanicum selection mosaic. (1) Interactions with generalist organisms may produce strong selection. (2) Spatial changes in main pollinators result in divergent selection across populations. (3) Geographic mosaics depend on a balance between mutualistic and antagonistic selection. (4) Selection mosaics operate at fairly small spatial scales. These findings will surely contribute to expanding the conceptual framework of the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Corolla shape evolution; Diffuse selection; Divergent selection; Erysimum mediohispanicum; Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution; Herbivores; Multispecific systems; Pollinators; Structural equation modeling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149096222

Typically, these deceptive systems have low visitation and fruiting rates because pollinators can learn to avoid non-rewarding species. Consequently, pollination ecology studies in these species often require long hours in the field to witness relatively few floral visitations relative to rewarding plants. Cypripedium parviflorum is a food-deceptive orchid with a pouch-like trap that temporarily imprisons pollinators. To escape, pollinators exert pressure on the stigma which facilitates pollination and widens the escape holes located near each anther. This study reports the use of a ribbon and clip to block the escape passageway of this species in order to retain and observe visiting insects. The device was tested in a large population and was shown to increase significantly the probability of observing floral visitors by nearly three-fold. Ten species of hymenopteran visitors in the families Andrenidae, Apidae, Halictidae and Megachilidae were observed, with two female Adrena tridens and one male Adrena perplexa successfully removing pollen. Insect visitation to the orchids occurred during the first half of the flowering period and was significantly associated with warm, clear days. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",Andrena; Cypripedioideae; Food deceptive; Hymenoptera; Orchid; Pollination; Ribbon; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64949085500

The duration of the EPP was variable between year and cultivar. Fruit set declined gradually in response to sequential cross-pollination. Consistent differences with respect to the maximum levels of initial fruit set occurred between 4 - 6 d after anthesis (DAA) in 'Manzanillo', and between 8-14 DAA in 'Picual'. Fertilisation was first observed on day-2 after cross-pollination in both cultivars. Ovule longevity, determined by fluorescence microscopy, appeared to last > 14 d in both cultivars. The stigmas remained receptive for > 8 d. Estimates of the duration of the EPP, based on analyses of its components, were longer than those indicated by the declines observed in fruit set, suggesting that other factors such as the suitability of the style to support pollen tube growth may limit the duration of the EPP.

Box 4005, 6080 AA Haelen, Netherlands","Although the hormones, gibberellin and auxin, are known to play a role in the initiation of fruits, no such function has yet been demonstrated for abscisic acid (ABA). However, ABA signaling and ABA responses are high in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) ovaries before pollination and decrease thereafter (Vriezen et al. in New Phytol 177:60-76, 2008). As a first step to understanding the role of ABA in ovary development and fruit set in tomato, we analyzed ABA content and the expression of genes involved in its metabolism in relation to pollination. We show that ABA levels are relatively high in mature ovaries and decrease directly after pollination, while an increase in the ABA metabolite dihydrophaseic acid was measured. An important regulator of ABA biosynthesis in tomato is 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase (LeNCED1), whose mRNA level in ovaries is reduced after pollination. The increased catabolism is likely caused by strong induction of one of four newly identified putative (+)ABA 8'-hydroxylase genes. This gene was named SlCYP707A1 and is expressed specifically in ovules and placenta. Transgenic plants, overexpressing SlCYP707A1, have reduced ABA levels and exhibit ABA-deficient phenotypes suggesting that this gene encodes a functional ABA 8'-hydroxylase. Gibberellin and auxin application have different effects on the LeNCED1 and SlCYP707A1 gene expression. The crosstalk between auxins, gibberellins and ABA during fruit set is discussed.",(+)ABA 8'-hydroxylase; ABA metabolism; Abscisic acid; LeNCED1; SlCYP707A1; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349124819

Owing to habitat loss and fragmentation, this commercially important species is vulnerable to extinction. Breeding system and fecundity were investigated in nine populations incorporating three habitat types (moderately disturbed, highly disturbed, and intact) to determine if seed set, seed weight, and genetic diversity are compromised by disturbance. Breeding success was also tested using pollen donors from distant (30-100 km), local (2-3 km), neighbor (10-20 m), and near-neighbor (< 10 m) sources. Macadamia tetraphylla is weakly self-compatible but incapable of automatic self-pollination. Across populations, seed to flower ratios were always < 0.1 percent in open-pollinated trees and trees from moderately disturbed habitats had the highest fruit production. Outcross pollen produced more seed per raceme than open-pollinated or self-pollination treatments. Seed set and seed weights were positively influenced by pollen source with local pollen and distant pollen effecting more or heavier seeds. Germination rates and genetic diversity did not vary significantly in seedlings from different pollen sources. Results suggest a pollen source from at least a 2 km distance is an optimal outbreeding distance; however, many wild populations do not have conspecifics at optimal distances owing to habitat fragmentation. Highly disturbed populations are producing seed but the longevity of these sites is threatened by weed invasions. We conclude that small populations in degraded habitats that are at risk of being overlooked should not be ignored but should be a focus for restoration efforts as they are a valuable asset for the conservation of M. tetraphylla. © 2008 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Distance-dependent reproduction; Habitat fragmentation; Pollen source; Pollination success; Pollinator limitation; Wild germplasm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349121218

We simulated leaf damage in Cucurbita pepo subsp. texana and measured fragrance emission and other floral characters of both male and female flowers. Contrary to our expectations, damage increased fragrance production, but only in male flowers. Female flowers, which were bigger and produced more fragrance than males, were unaffected by leaf damage. The greatest increase in floral fragrance compounds was in the terpenoids, which we hypothesize could be byproducts of defensively induced cucurbitacins, or they may function defensively themselves. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate changes in floral fragrance due to leaf damage.

Many Neotropical bats of the family Phyllostomidae provide ecosystem services associated with pollination and seed dispersal that promote the regeneration of disturbed areas; therefore, effects of RIL on these species is of particular concern. We determined patterns of temporal activity, degree of temporal overlap of activity, and dispersion in peaks of activity for seven abundant species of frugivorous bat in Tapajós National Forest, Pará, Brazil. In addition, we evaluated the effects of RIL at a harvest level of 18.7 m3/ha and habitat physiognomy on temporal patterns of activity for these species. Bats were surveyed for four nights at each of 96 sites for a total sampling effort of 64,512 net-m-h. Sites were distributed among four experimental blocks, two blocks of unlogged forest and two blocks of forest subjected to RIL. Half of the sites in each management type were in forest gaps and half were in closed-canopy forest. In general, species exhibited similar patterns of activity, and greater than expected temporal overlap in activity among species. RIL and forest physiognomy had little effect on activity patterns of species. RIL in Amazonia removes fewer trees than do naturally occurring treefalls and such changes in habitat structure do not alter activity patterns of frugivorous bats. Evidence suggests that RIL does not have an appreciable adverse effect on frugivorous bats in Amazonia. © 2008 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Behavior; Conservation; Deforestation; Habitat use; Phyllostomidae; Sustainable use forest management; Tapajós, Brazil; Temporal overlap",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349121801

Developmental destabilization of sexual reproduction as a result of hybridization and/or polyploidy appears to be a general trigger for its evolution, but the evidence is complicated by ploidy-level changes and hybridization occurring with facultative apomixis. The repeated origins of polyploid apomictic complexes in the palaeopolyploid Maloid Rosaceae suggest a new model of evolutionary transitions that may have wider applicability. Two conjectures are fundamental to this model: (1) that as previously suggested by Rutishauser, like many sexual flowering plants the polyploid apomicts require maternal-paternal balance in the second fertilization event that gives rise to the endosperm, and (2) that the observed variation in endosperm ploidy levels relates less to flexibility late in development than to the known variation in developmental origin of the megagametophyte between mechanisms loosely categorized as diplospory and apospory. The model suggests explanations for the relative frequencies of apospory and diplospory, and for the wide but incomplete associations of apospory with a pollination requirement (pseudogamy) and of diplospory with autonomous development of the endosperm. It is suggested that pollination from other taxa may provide some adaptive advantage to pseudogamous apospory. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Apospory; Asexual reproduction; Crataegus; Diplospory; Endosperm; Gametophytic apomixis; Polyploid evolution; Rosaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349090050

The reproductive output of individuals varying in their strength of SI may also be affected by population density via its affect on the spatial structuring and number of S-alleles in populations. Modifiers increasing levels of self-compatibility can be selected when self-compatible individuals receive reproductive compensation by, for example, increasing seed set and/or when they become associated with high fitness genotypes. Methods The effect of variation in the strength of SI and scrub density (low versus high) on seed set, seed germination and inbreeding depression in seed germination (?germ) was investigated in the partially self-incompatible species Flourensia cernua by analysing data from self-, cross- and open-pollinated florets. Key Results Examination of 100 plants in both high and low scrub densities revealed that 51 of plants were strongly self-incompatible and 49 varied from being self-incompatible to self-compatible. Seed set after hand cross-pollination was higher than after open-pollination for self-incompatible, partially self-incompatible and self-compatible plants but was uniformly low for strongly self-incompatible plants. Strongly self-incompatible and self-incompatible plants exhibited lower seed set, seed germination and multiplicative female fitness (floral display × seed set × seed germination) in open-pollinated florets compared with partially self-incompatible and self-compatible plants. Scrub density also had an effect on seed set and inbreeding depression: in low-density scrubs seed set was higher after open-pollination and ?germ was lower. Conclusions These data suggest that (a) plants suffered outcross pollen limitation, (b) female fitness in partially self-incompatible and self-compatible plants is enhanced by increased mate-compatibility and (c) plants in low-density scrubs received higher quality pollen via open-pollination than plants in high-density scrubs.",Female fitness; Flourensia cernua; Mapimí Biosphere Reserve; Partial self-incompatibility; Population density; Seed germination; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349139033

Floral patterns have previously been shown to be advantageous in pollinator attraction, and we discuss whether emphasis of pigment patterns by structural color may increase floral recognition by pollinators. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.",Diffraction grating; Floral characteristics; Iridescence; Pollination; Structural color; Ultraviolet,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953726709

The coordination of growth between the seed and ovary tissues involves phytohormones; however, the specific mechanisms remain speculative. This study further explores the roles of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and catabolism genes during pollination and fruit development and in seed and auxin regulation of pericarp growth. Pollination and fertilization events not only increase pericarp PsGA3ox1 message levels (codes for GA 3-oxidase that converts GA 20 to bioactive GA1) but also reduce pericarp PsGA2ox1 mRNA levels (codes for GA 2-oxidase that mainly catabolizes GA20 to GA29), suggesting a concerted regulation to increase levels of bioactive GA1 following these events. 4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA) was found to mimic the seeds in the stimulation of PsGA3ox1 and the repression of PsGA2ox1 mRNA levels as well as the stimulation of PsGA2ox2 mRNA levels (codes for GA 2-oxidase that mainly catabolizes GA1 to GA 8) in pericarp at 2 to 3 d after anthesis, while the other endogenous pea auxin, IAA, did not. This GA gene expression profile suggests that both seeds and 4-Cl-IAA can stimulate the production, as well as modulate the half-life, of bioactive GA1, leading to initial fruit set and subsequent growth and development of the ovary. Consistent with these gene expression profiles, deseeded pericarps converted [14C]GA 12 to [14C]GA1 only if treated with 4-Cl-IAA. These data further support the hypothesis that 4-Cl-IAA produced in the seeds is transported to the pericarp, where it differentially regulates the expression of pericarp GA biosynthesis and catabolism genes to modulate the level of bioactive GA1 required for initial fruit set and growth. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149156858

The thermoregulation has been hypothesized to offer a direct energy reward for pollinators in lotus flowers. This study aims to examine whether the stable temperature maintained in the floral chamber influences the fertilization process and seed development. Methods An artificial refrigeration instrument was employed to cool flowers during the fertilization process and post-fertilization period in an experimental population. The effect of temperature on post-pollination events was also examined by removing petals in two field populations. Key Results Treatments with low floral temperature did not reduce stigma receptivity or pollen viability in undehisced anthers. Low temperature during the fertilization period significantly decreased seed set per flower but low temperature during the phase of seed development had no effect, suggesting that temperature regulation by lotus flowers facilitated fertilization success. Hand-pollination treatments in two field populations indicated that seed set of flowers with petals removed was lower than that of intact flowers in north China, where ambient temperatures are low, but not in south China, confirming that reducing the temperature of carpels did influence post-pollination events.

Recently, naturalized populations of this species have spread rapidly, particularly in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Two niche-based models were constructed from independent data sets (presence-absence and presence-only data sets) and were used to validate one another. Both models performed well and indicated that the data compiled by participatory programs were useful for generating predictive models of the potential distribution of this invasive species. The models also revealed that the potential distribution of B. terrestris is negatively related to the proportion of woodland area, which corresponds to the known biology of this species. In contrast, the effect of the number of colonies introduced for tomato pollination (represented by tomato production) did not significantly affect the distribution of B. terrestris, indicating that its spread is now entering a phase of dispersal from established feral populations and that primary dispersal from commercial colonies in greenhouses is no longer a limiting factor for the distribution of this invasive species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to introgress desirable genes from a wild relative, Isatis indigotica (a dye and medicinal plant; 2n = 14), into Brassica crops, intertribal sexual hybridizations were carried out with B. rapa (2n = 20), and the resulting hybrids and their progenies were characterized. Methods Using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), chromosomal/genomic components of the hybrids and their progenies were analysed. Key Results Many hybrid plants were obtained from the mature seeds harvested from the B. rapa × I. indigotica cross, and these exhibited different morphological traits. However, the majority of them did not survive and only three plants grew to maturity. These three hybrids showed poor growth and much smaller stature than the two parents, but had some morphological traits and chemical composition of I. indigotica. One plant had 2n = 10, the haploid chromosome number of B. rapa, and was absolutely sterile. The other two plants had 20 and 22 somatic chromosomes and were male sterile but produced seeds following pollinations with B. rapa. All back-cross progenies over several generations maintained a B. rapa-type phenotype and also displayed some variations in morphological characters and fatty acid compositions. They were all 2n = 20 and showed good seed-set. The hybrid with 2n = 22 produced some progeny plants with 2n = 21 and 2n = 22. GISH detected two chromosomes of I. indigotica in the hybrid with 2n = 22 but none in the one with 2n = 20. AFLP bands specific for I. indigotica, novel for two parents or absent in B. rapa, were detected in the two hybrids and their progenies. These progeny plants were novel B. rapa types with an altered genomic constitution or alien additions.

Here we take issue with the conclusions of the paper that there should be selection pressure for nonrewarding flowers to be available earlier in the season in order to avoid dissimilar sympatric rewarding species. Consideration of selection pressure must take into account temporal variation in total pollinator availability, pollinator longevity and unlearned response, and the stability of plant communities over time, as well as the learned responses of individual pollinators that the original study focused on. Learning alone would not necessarily select for early flowering by nonrewarders if temporal variation in pollinator numbers is strong or naïve pollinators consistently appear throughout the flowering season. Further, we argue that early flowering could simply be a natural corollary of longevity of flowers needed to combat negative frequency-dependent selection and low overall visitation rates by pollinators, rather than a trait that has been specifically selected to reduce temporal overlap with competing rewarding species. © 2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",Deception of pollinators; Longevity of flowers; Orchids; Pollination; Rewardless flowers; Timing of flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249142827

Genetic studies have provided evidence that P. densata originated through hybridization between P. yunnanensis and P. tabuliformis. To clarify the relationships among these pines, and assess their reproductive fitness in their respective habitats, we conducted a comparative analysis of eight cone and seed morphometric traits and six reproductive traits in them. Among the eight morphometric traits examined, six appeared to be intermediate in P. densata between those of P. yunnanensis and P. tabuliformis. There were significant differences among the three pines in all of the morphometric traits, and P. densata showed greater variability in these traits than the other two pines. In contrast to the morphometric traits, the reproductive traits (including the proportions of filled and empty seeds, ovule abortion rate, seed efficiency, meiotic abnormalities during microsporogenesis and pollen viability) differed little among the three pines, indicating that they have similar overall rates of effective pollination and fertilization in their respective natural environments. Despite their location on the high plateau, natural populations of P. densata appeared to have normal levels of reproductive success, comparable to those of the two parental species in their natural habitats.

Methods The general validity of this concept was checked by surveying a taxonomically diverse array of 38 insect-pollinated Mediterranean species. The interplay between fresh biomass investment, linear size and percentage corolla allocation was studied. Allometric relationships between traits were investigated by reduced major-axis regression, and qualitative correlates of floral variation explored using general linear-model MANOVA. Key Results Across species, flowers were perfectly isometrical with regard to corolla allocation (i.e. larger flowers were just scaled-up versions of smaller ones and vice versa). In contrast, linear size and biomass varied allometrically (i.e. there were shape variations, in addition to variations in size). Most floral variables correlated positively and significantly across species, except corolla allocation, which was largely determined by family membership and floral symmetry. On average, species with bilateral flowers allocated more to the corolla than those with radial flowers. Plant life-form was immaterial to all of the studied traits. Flower linear size variation was in general low among conspecifics (coefficients of variation around 10 ), whereas biomass was in general less uniform (e.g. 200-400 mg in Cistus salvifolius). Significant among-population differences were detected for all major quantitative floral traits.

Orchis italica and O. anthropophora are two related orchid species that produce a known hybrid form, O. xbivonae. Here, we analysed a hybrid zone of these two orchids using molecular analysis and experimental crosses. As molecular tools, we employed both real-time PCR and PCR amplification of nuclear markers to evaluate the occurrence of backcross recombination. With these approaches, we demonstrated that all examined hybrids belong to the F1 generation. Chloroplast DNA analysis showed that O. anthropophora was the maternal species of most of hybrid specimens and that cytoplasmic introgression was lacking in both parental species. Pollination experiments showed that the two orchid species were strictly out-crossing, although self-compatible, and have comparable levels of reproductive fitness in all crossing treatments. Conversely, hybrids demonstrated low reproductive success in all intra- and back-crossing treatments. The absence of any backcross generations and plastid introgression suggest that O. xbivonae does not represent a bridge to gene flow between O. italica and O. anthropophora.

We used 2 years' data from a field experiment to relate the reproduction and survival of focal Silene latifolia plants to the numbers of conspecific plants and flowers within a range of distances (0.16-150 m) from the focal plants. Thus we consider spatial scale as a continuously-varying component of population density. 3. Because the data come from a single continuous population, we fitted regression models in two stages in order to remove spatial autocorrelation induced by environmental factors before modelling density effects. As well as single-scale models, we fitted multiple-scale models to explore interaction kernels. We statistically standardized plant size in some analyses to isolate pollination effects. 4. Reproductive output per plant generally decreased with greater densities of plants and flowers; for example there was a negative effect of female flowers within a 70-m radius in the second year. However, at low female densities there was a positive effect of male flowers at a scale of 13 m in the first year. Seed-set per flower decreased with greater densities of flowers in the second year (at radii < 10 m). Seed predation was greater when more female flowers were present within 5-7 m. Plants' survival probability increased with density within 0.28 m for all but the smallest plants. 5. We also collected data on the pattern and reproductive success of S. latifolia plants in a natural population nearby and applied similar methodology. Here the negative effects of female flower densities occurred at finer scales and gave way to positive effects above 2 m, contrasting with some patterns from the experiment. 6. Synthesis. In a sessile population interacting with mobile biota, the effects of density on individual fitness may vary with the way in which density is measured.

RS is pollinator and pollination limited in food deceptive orchids, but this has rarely been studied in sexually deceptive orchid species. Here, we tested the effects of several individual (plant height, inflorescence size, nearest neighbour distance and flower position) and population (patch geometry, population density and size) parameters on RS in three sexually deceptive Ophrys (Orchidaceae) species. Inter-specific differences were observed in RS of flowers situated in the upper versus the lower part of the inflorescence, likely due to species-specific pollinator behaviour. For all three species examined, RS increased with increasing plant height, inflorescence size and nearest neighbour distance. RS generally increased with decreasing population density and increasing patch elongation. Given these results, we postulate that pollinator availability, rather than pollinator learning, is the most limiting factor in successful reproduction for sexually deceptive orchids. Our results also suggest that olfactory 'display' (i.e. versus optical display), in terms of inflorescence size (and co-varying plant height), plays a key role in individual RS of sexually deceptive orchids. In this regard, several hypotheses are suggested and discussed. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Individual, population and environmental parameters; Ophrys; Pollinator limitation; Reproductive success; Sexually deceptive orchids",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64349098640

Bag X01, Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg 3209, South Africa","Many of the diverse animals that consume floral rewards act as efficient pollinators; however, others 'steal' rewards without 'paying' for them by pollinating. In contrast to the extensive studies of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of nectar theft, pollen theft and its implications remain largely neglected, even though it affects plant reproduction more directly. Here we review existing studies of pollen theft and find that: (1) most pollen thieves pollinate other plant species, suggesting that theft generally arises from a mismatch between the flower and thief that precludes pollen deposition, (2) bees are the most commonly documented pollen thieves, and (3) the floral traits that typically facilitate pollen theft involve either spatial or temporal separation of sex function within flowers (herkogamy and dichogamy, respectively). Given that herkogamy and dichogamy occur commonly and that bees are globally the most important floral visitors, pollen theft is likely a greatly under-appreciated component of floral ecology and influence on floral evolution. We identify the mechanisms by which pollen theft can affect plant fitness, and review the evidence for theft-induced ecological effects, including pollen limitation. We then explore the consequences of pollen theft for the evolution of floral traits and sexual systems, and conclude by identifying key directions for future research. © 2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",Cheating; Pollen limitation; Pollen parasitism; Pollen robbery; Pollination efficiency; Sexual systems; Toxic pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249153464

Pollen collected from the spikes 1, 2, and 3 days after irradiation were transferred to emasculated spikes of the common wheat cv. 'Chinese Spring'. Genomic in situ hybridization was used to identify wheat-H. villosa chromosome translocations in the M1 generation. Transmission of the identified translocation chromosomes was analyzed in the BC1, BC2, and BC3 generations. The results indicated that all three irradiation doses were highly efficient for inducing wheat-alien translocations without affecting the viability of the M1 seeds. Within the range of 800-1,600 rad, both the efficiency of translocation induction and the frequency of interstitial chromosome breakage-fusion increased as the irradiation dosage increased. A higher translocation induction frequency was observed using pollen collected from the spikes 1 day after irradiation over that of 2 or 3 days after irradiation. More than 70% of the translocations detected in the M1 generation were transmitted to the BC1 through the female gametes. All translocations recovered in the BC1 generation were recovered in the following BC2, and BC3 generations. The transmission ability of different translocation types in different genetic backgrounds showed an order of 'whole-arm translocation &gt; small alien segment translocation &gt; large alien segment translocation', through either male or female gametes. In general, the transmission ability through the female gametes was higher than that through the male gametes.

We conclude that morphology often does not work and that it is often nowhere near as 'rich' as has been argued. Morphology is particularly poor in numerous important situations, such as the association of larvae with adults and discrimination among cryptic species.

In the pollen mother cells of the male sterile hybrid, chromosome pairing and segregation were normal. Histological sectioning of its anthers showed that the tapetum was multiple layers and was hypertrophic from the stage of sporogenic cells, and that the tetrads were compressed by the vacuolated and disaggregated tapetum and no mature pollen grains were formed in anther sacs, thus resulting in male sterility.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and diseases, history and conservation. 2. Primula veris is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte, mostly found in well-drained, herb-rich meadows and grasslands, in scrub or woodland rides and edges, and on calcareous cliffs. It occurs on base-rich loams or clays, on limestone, and sometimes in dunes. 3. Native to the British Isles, it is characteristic of many mesotrophic and calcicolous lowland grassland communities, but it also extends into upland valleys in northern England and Scotland. In Ireland it is also native and most abundant in the central plain. Primula veris occurs throughout the temperate areas of Europe as far east as the Russian border. 4. Primula veris is a shade-intolerant species that shows reduced performance and flowering under shade or increased competition. The species is not able to penetrate anoxic soil layers and is therefore mostly absent from locations that are characterized by a high water table. It has a well-developed drought tolerance. 5. Primula veris is an obligate outbreeder which entirely depends on foraging insects for successful pollination. Although the species shows heterostyly, with two reciprocal morphs (pin and thrum), only relatively low levels of intermorph pollination have been reported. Seed dispersal is restricted to a few centimetres from maternal plants, whereas pollen flow is wider, but still limited to a few metres from parental plants. Both are factors that contribute to a significantly fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood size. 6. At several locations throughout the British Isles, P. veris occurs together with P. elatior and especially P. vulgaris. The hybrid P. veris × P. vulgaris = P. × polyantha occurs frequently in mixed populations, whereas the hybrid P. veris × P. elatior = P. × media has been rarely reported in Britain. 7. Although P. veris is still a widespread grassland herb, it is less abundant in the British Isles and continental Europe than before. This decline can be attributed to changes in land-use practices, such as the loss of traditional hay-meadow management, the loss of grazing and an increase of ploughing, in combination with ongoing destruction and nutrient enrichment of permanent grasslands.

Breeding tolerant rootstocks is thought to be the most promising method for phytophthora root rot disease control but breeding avocado is challenging. The avocado flowering syndrome (synchronous protogynous dichogamy), combined with high flowering and low fruit set, render controlled pollination exceedingly difficult. Juxtaposing complementary flowering types of elite parent cultivars (cultivars that produce progeny with tolerance to phytophthora root rot) was performed in an effort to increase the number of full-sib progeny for elite maternal parents and, hypothetically, the number of phytophthora root rot tolerant progeny. Although high outcrossing rates were achieved (estimated ?93%), the majority of progeny had a non-elite paternal parent (56% of progeny were offtypes) implying maternal trees were pollinated by non-elite distant trees. Among progeny that could be confidently genotyped, a high number of cross types were detected (33). Contrary to our hypothesis, a significant portion of the progeny were the result of crosses between like, and not complementary, flowering types. The spatial distribution of productive trees and grafts helped to explain these data, as productive grafts were directly adjacent to grafts of the same flowering type more often than that of the complementary flowering type. Selfed progeny were significantly less tolerant to phytophthora root rot than outcrossed progeny. Progeny resulting from crosses between an elite maternal parent and non-elite pollen donor (offtypes) were less tolerant than full-sib progeny resulting from crosses between elite parents. Maternal effects may interfere with identifying truly disease tolerant selections. Thus, to reduce maternal effects and non-elite pollen donor contamination, removal of seedling cotyledons before screening for disease tolerance and better isolation of elite parent trees and windbreaks may improve breeding efficacy. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of microsatellite markers in parentage analysis where a high proportion of the putative parents are closely related. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.",Avocado; Breeding; Dichogamy; Microsatellite markers; Outcrossing; Persea americana; Phytophthora cinnamomi; Root rot,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60949090428

Three distinct kinds of flowers were observed in this species: (1) about 54% of the flowers had pistils that were of equal length or shorter than the stamens (PESS); (2) in 23.5% of the flowers, the pistils were longer than the stamens (PLS), and; (3) in 22.5% of the flowers, the styles were positioned axially away from the anthers (SAA). No significant difference in fruit setting rate was observed between PLS and SAA flowers, but PESS flowers set less fruits than the other two. A breeding experiment indicated that the species was self-incompatible, and revealed that the presence of PLS and SAA could increase outcrossing and fruit set. A field experiment showed that open-pollinated flowers of E. sagittatum produced significantly less fruits than an artificial xenogamy experiment. This may be because most of the flowers in natural populations have pistils and anthers of the same length (PESS). The principal visitors and effective pollinators are Bombus sp1 and Bombus sp2. Attractant experiments indicated that the fruit set of flowers whose spurs were removed was significantly lower than that of flowers whose stamens were removed, suggesting that the spurs of the flowers could strongly increase the pollinator visitation and fruit set. The results therefore showed that floral morphology could significantly affect fruit set in E. sagittatum. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Epimedium sagittatum; Floral morphology; Fruit set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349120002

Investigation of pollen performance is essential in breeding experiments or artificial pollination procedures, especially in a crop such as chestnut, some genotypes of which are characterized by male sterility. Our study was carried out to determine the pollen germination rate and the pollen tube growth of some European chestnut genotypes. Materials and methods. Seven Turkish advanced chestnut selections (SE3-12, SE18-2, SE21-2, SE21-9, 552-8, 552-10 and 554-14), and a cultivar (Sariaslama), growing in two different locations, were studied in the central Black Sea region of Turkey in 2006. For this purpose, in vitro pollen germination tests were performed on media with four different concentrations of sucrose [(0, 5, 10 and 15)%]. Results and discussion. The pollen germination rates of the eight genotypes studied were significantly different due to the sucrose concentrations. The best pollen germination rate was found in the 554-14 chestnut genotype (35.80%). The best sucrose concentration for a high germination rate and pollen tube growth was 10%. For the same genotype, the results varied due to the two different study locations (Terme and Fatsa). A linear relationship between the sucrose concentrations and pollen tube length was found to be significant in most genotypes. The longest pollen tube length was found in the 554-14 genotype (74 ?m). © 2009 Cirad/EDP Sciences.",Castanea sativa; Growth; Pollen germination; Pollen tubes; Turkey,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650473957

Therefore, an important goal for maize breeders is to improve local germplasm sources of inbred lines that are able to grow under these challenging conditions. The objective of this research was to evaluate direct and correlated responses in two improved early maturing maize populations [NDSCD(M)C10 and BS22(R)C7] after two cycles of S1 and full-sib intra-population recurrent selection for cold tolerance. The S1 and full-sib progenies were obtained by self-pollinating 100 random plants and by intercrossing 200 random plants, respectively. Ten percent of the families were selected, based on an index that included emergence percentage, seedling vigor, and root lodging percentage, and recombined at the same time in a summer nursery based upon data across northern North Dakota locations. The essential benefit of this breeding methodology was to achieve one year per cycle of selection based upon progenies. However, direct response to selection was not significant while some correlated responses were significant. We decided to report these results in order to encourage other scientists the evaluation of additional sources of germplasm, the screening at various dates, and the selection of target environments with more intensive cold stress before initiating long-term selection programs for cold tolerance. In addition, further research on the current and alternative long-term selection methods for cold tolerance is recommended for continuous genetic improvement of advanced cycles in the northern U.S. Corn Belt. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cold tolerance; Divergent recurrent selection; Germplasm improvement; Maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63949088380

To address this issue in tomato, immature seeds were excised from fruit at different maturity stages and transferred to culture medium. The best culture medium was modified full strength Moorashige-Skoog (MS) salts supplemented with 0.1 mg l -1 IAA, 0.5 mg l-1 IBA, 0.5 mg l-1 GA 3 and 2% sucrose. If the excised seeds were able to grow, most showed shoot formation after a week. Seeds extracted as early as 10 days after pollination were successfully cultured provided they were transferred aseptically and without injury. No morphological or physiological changes in regenerated plants and their fruit relative to the parent were detected. Germination from immature seeds of tomato is a simpler alternative to in vitro culture of immature embryos or callus, as it can be undertaken in comparatively less stringent laboratory conditions. Using this approach, five generations can be produced in a year in contrast to a maximum of three generations with conventional methods.

Clustering indicated possible gene fl ow between CWR and VWR. Genetic variation within populations was minimal and comparable to that of the barley cultivars.

Since the discovery of the MEP pathway, possible metabolic cross-talk between these pathways has prompted intense research. Although many studies have shown the existence of such cross-talk using feeding experiments, it remains to be determined if native cross-talk, rather than exogenously applied metabolites, can compensate for complete blockage of the MVA pathway. Previously, Arabidopsis mutants for HMG1 and HMG2 encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) were isolated. Although it was shown that HMGR1 is a functional HMGR, the enzyme activity of HMGR2 has not been confirmed. It is demonstrated here that HMG2 encodes a functional reductase with similar activity to HMGR1, using enzyme assays and complementation experiments. To estimate the contribution of native cross-talk, an attempt was made to block the MVA pathway by making double mutants lacking both HMG1 and HMG2, but no double homozygotes were detected in the progeny of self-pollinated HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2 plants. hmg1 hmg2 male gametophytes appeared to be lethal based on crossing experiments, and microscopy indicated that ?50% of the microspores from the HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2 plant appeared shrunken and exhibited poorly defined endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In situ hybridization showed that HMG1 transcripts were expressed in both the tapetum and microspores, while HMG2 mRNA appeared only in microspores. It is concluded that native cross-talk from the plastid cannot compensate for complete blockage of the MVA pathway, at least during male gametophyte development, because either HMG1 or HMG2 is required for male gametophyte development.",Anther; Cross-talk; HMG-CoA reductase; Isoprenoid; Male gametophyte; MEP pathway; MVA pathway; Pollen; Sterol; Tapetum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249123951

Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood. 2. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape. 3. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility. 4. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area. Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scaleof impact of forage provision on nesting density.© 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.",Bombus pascuorum; Forage availability; Foraging range; Kinship; Mass flowering crops; Microsatellites; Nest density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349584897

It was shown for the first time that the typical bull's eye pattern is already established at the early stages of flower anthesis on the front side of the petal surface, but is hidden to pollinators until the buds are open and the petals are unfolded. The rear side of the petals remains UV-reflecting during the whole flower anthesis. Studies on the local distribution of 19 flavonols across the petals confirmed that the majority are concentrated in the basal part of the ray flower. However, in contrast to the earlier studies, eupatolitin 3-O-glucoside (6,7-dimethoxyquercetin 3-O-glucoside) was present in both the basal and apical parts of the petals, whereas eupatolin (6,7-dimethoxyquercetin 3-O-rhamnoside) was exclusively found in the apical parts. The enzymes involved in the formation of the flavonols in R. hirta were demonstrated for the first time. These include a rare flavonol 6-hydroxylase, which was identified as cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase and did not accept any methylated flavonol as substrate. All enzymes were present in the basal and apical parts of the petals, although some of them clearly showed higher activities in the basal part. This indicates that the local accumulation of flavonols in R. hirta is not achieved by a locally restricted presence of the enzymes involved in flavonol formation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of implicit restrictions, however, palynology fails to reconstruct in detail the distributional patterns and whether monospecific or mixed forests prevailed. Here we test the hypothesis that the distributional patterns of Pinus and Betula were largely determined by substrate. Location Fifteen sites in north-east Germany. Methods As pollen data reflect the abundance of taxa around a sample site, our hypothesis implies that the abundance of e.g. Pinus pollen should reflect the abundance of substrate types that are favoured by Pinus. (In order to differentiate clearly between taxa and pollen types, the latter are displayed in small capitals.) We analysed the percentage of Pinus and Betula pollen from an interval in the Allerød, and their relationship to the present-day proportion of the two dominant substrate types (sand and boulder clay). The substrate proportion was determined in rings from 1 to 50 km around all sites, using four distance-weighting functions. Results Pollen percentages of Pinus are linearly related to the proportion of sand, and Betula percentages to the proportion of boulder clay. The highest coefficients of determination (r 2 = 0.89 and 0.91, respectively) were observed for radii of c. 30 km, with distance weighting by 1 and 1/d. Main conclusions The present-day distributional pattern of substrate types strongly indicates the distributional pattern of Pinus and Betula in north-east Germany in the Allerød. Assuming that the pattern of substrates remained broadly constant, Pinus dominated on sand and Betula on boulder clay. Our new method thus enables us to refine significantly the reconstruction of habitat characteristics and distributional patterns of taxa in the Lateglacial and Holocene, independent of their present-day ecological amplitudes. The good performance of the distance-weighting functions 1 and 1/d indicates that the pollen source area of a site has rather discrete boundaries determined by convective air movements during daytime. Within these boundaries, pollen is evenly distributed over various distances. This implies that light pollen types are transported further than predicted by Sutton's equation on particle dispersal. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Allerød; Betula; Europe; Palaeoecology; Pinus; Pollen analysis; Pollen dispersal; Quantitative vegetation reconstruction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64649086791

Due to the steep precipitation gradient from the centre to the edges in this monsoon affected area, A. dhofarica is found in two different habitat types: in continuous woodland belts of the Hawf and Dhofar mountains, and in isolated, scattered woodland patches, as found especially in the Fartak Mts (south-east Yemen). Fifteen populations (212 individuals) from across the whole distribution area of the species were analysed using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting to: (1) evaluate the consequences of population fragmentation on the genetic diversity harboured in isolated patches versus cohering stands of the species and (2) to reconstruct the phylogeographical pattern of A. dhofarica as a consequence of oscillations in the monsoon activity during the Pleistocene and Holocene. The analysis of among-population genetic differentiation and within-population genetic diversity in A. dhofarica populations resulted in a lack of genetic pauperization and genetic differentiation of populations of the distinctly isolated patches of the Fartak Mts compared to the more luxurious forests of the Hawf and Dhofar regions. This is considered to be due to the high buffer capacity against the loss of genetic diversity caused by the long-lived life-form of the species combined with the capability to propagate clonally and the relatively recent fragmentation of Anogeissus forests into the described patches rather than due to high values of gene flow among remnant populations caused by bee pollination and anemochorical and hydrochorical diaspore dispersal. The phylogeographical pattern of the species argues for a quite recent fragmentation of a once continuous forest belt of A. dhofarica that is rather connected with climate changes in the Holocene than triggered by aridity-humidity oscillations reported for the Pleistocene. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",Biogeography; Fragmentation; Monsoon forest; Oman; Palaeo-African relict vegetation; Population genetics; Yemen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249131148

Through their selective foraging, large populations of white-tailed deer are altering population sizes, driving extirpations, and facilitating invasions of plants throughout the eastern United States. I hypothesize that deer can drive biotic homogenization in forest understory communities by shifting species composition to one dominated by grasses, sedges, and ferns (all wind-pollinated plants). I report the effects of 16 years of deer exclusion in a hemlock-northern hardwood stand in N Wisconsin using a block design. Species composition showed greater convergence in control plots than exclosure plots, indicating deer can drive biotic homogenization at the stand level. Total percent cover is nearly 4 times greater in exclosure plots. Percent cover by woody plants, broadleaf herbs, and ferns is 150, 63, and 20 times greater in exclosure plots, respectively, while cover by sedges and grasses is 3.8 and 2.2 times greater in control plots. Cover by species with showy, insect-pollinated flowers is 79 times greater in exclosures.

Using microsatellite markers, we examined historical and contemporary genetic variation from an apparently declining bumble bee species, Bombus pensylvanicus, and from a stable species, Bombus impatiens, in central Illinois. For each species, we genotyped specimens from the Illinois Natural History Survey collected from three populations between 1969-1972 and from a resurvey of the same areas conducted in 2008. Population structure in B. pensylvanicus increased markedly over the last four decades (from ?ST = 0.001 to 0.027) while no structure was detected in B. impatiens for either time period (?ST = -0.006 to -0.003). Changes in genetic diversity were not significant for either species, although small reductions were observed for B. pensylvanicus in all three populations. Coalescent simulations incorporating both contemporary and historical samples suggest that this small change is not surprising for recent population declines, as large reductions in genetic diversity were only apparent under the most severe bottleneck scenarios. These results demonstrate how comparisons of genetic patterns between temporal periods and species can help elucidate potential threats to population health and suggest several strategies that might be useful in the conservation of B. pensylvanicus in the Midwestern USA. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ancient DNA; Apidae; Conservation; Hymenoptera; Natural history collections; Pollinator decline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549163771

We describe temporal and spatial patterns of biosynthesis and release of floral volatiles throughout the blooming of V. vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. The biosynthesis of sesquiterpene volatiles, which are emitted with a light-dependent diurnal pattern early in the morning at prebloom and bloom, is localized to anthers and, more specifically, within the developing pollen grains. Valencene synthase (VvValCS) enzyme activity, which produces the major sesquiterpene volatiles of grapevine flowers, is present in anthers. VvValCS transcripts are most abundant in flowers at prebloom stages. Western blot analysis identified VvValCS protein in anthers, and in situ immunola-beling located VvValCS protein in pollen grains during bloom.

The experiments were carried out in cages, once with bumblebees as pollinators and once without. In the absence of herbivory but with the presence of bumblebees, singly grown plant lines without lectin generally performed better than lines with lectin. Pollen beetles affected plant growth and reproduction, but there were no consistent differences between the lectin and non-lectin plant lines indicating that the transgenic trait did not protect plants from pest attack. Herbivory reduced the number of seeds when bumblebees were present. In the absence of bumblebees, however, plants produced more seeds with pollen beetles than without, indicating that some pollination was carried out by the beetles. Efficient pollination affected the competitive abilities of the lines; lectin lines were more competitive with bumblebees present and the reverse was true when bumblebees were absent. In the presence of bumblebees, lectin lines gained from being grown mixed with its non-transgenic counterpart. Because the transgenic plants expressed pea lectin in developing pollen it is possible that pollen quality in those plants was reduced, which may explain why the lectin lines had an advantage over non-lectin lines when exchange of pollen between the two plant types was facilitated by bumblebees. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Fitness; Herbivory; Pea lectin; Pollination; Seed production; Viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349099410

Here, we present a model of cross-pollination between plant populations due to the wind. We perform a 'mass budget' of pollen by accounting for the number of pollen grains from release in the source population, dispersal from the source to the sink population by the wind, and deposition on receptive surfaces in the sink population. Our model can be parameterised for any wind-pollinated species, but we apply it to Brassica napus (oilseed rape or canola) to investigate the threat posed by wind pollination to GM confinement in agriculture. Specifically, we calculate the maximum feasible distance at which a particular level of windborne gene dispersal could be attained. This is equivalent to the separation distance between populations or fields required to achieve a given threshold of gene dispersal or adventitious GM presence. As required, model predictions of the upper bounds on levels of wind-mediated gene dispersal exceed observations from a wide range of published studies. For a level of gene dispersal below 0.9%, which is the EU threshold for GM adventitious presence, we predict that the maximum feasible distance for agricultural fields of B. napus is 1000 m, regardless of field shape and direction of prevailing winds. For fields closer than 1000 m, our model results do not necessarily imply that the 0.9% threshold is likely to be breached, because in this instance we have conservatively set the values of parameters where current knowledge is limited. We also predict that gene dispersal is reduced by 50% when the lag in peak flowering between the source and sink populations is 13 days, and reduced by 90% when the lag is 24 days. We identify further measurements necessary to improve the accuracy of the model predictions. Our model is valuable because it identifies the maximum feasible distance at which a particular level of windborne gene dispersal could be attained, which provides a high-confidence separation distance for a given level of gene containment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we use equation discovery methodology that combines background knowledge and empirical data from several studies. We induce models that predict the degree of outcrossing rate between the donor (GM) and the recipient (non-GM) maize field from the distance between the fields and the local wind characteristics (speed, direction and duration).

Floral traits that influence animal pollinator behavior are the target of pollinator-mediated selection, but can only evolve if floral phenotypes have underlying genetic variation. Thus, understanding the genetic basis of a floral trait is a crucial step in studying pollinator-mediated selection. In this study I tested the effect of quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying floral traits on pollinator behavior in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus L. and its crop relative. The indirect effects of QTL on pollinator behavior, mediated by floral phenotypes, were analyzed for six insect visitor types using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis. For three of the six visitor types (large and small bees and non-bee insects) valid models were revealed when all three levels (QTL, floral traits, and pollinator behavior) were incorporated.

However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Disruption of pollinator movement is one hypothesis put forward to explain this pattern in pollen limitation. However, the small size of pollinators makes them very difficult to track; thus, knowledge of their movements is largely speculative. Using tiny radio transmitters (0.25 g), we translocated a generalist tropical 'trap-lining' hummingbird, the green hermit (Phaethornis guy), across agricultural and forested landscapes to test the hypothesis that movement is influenced by patterns of deforestation. Although, we found no difference in homing times between landscape types, return paths were on average 459±144 m (±s.e.) more direct in forested than agricultural landscapes. In addition, movement paths in agricultural landscapes contained 36±4 per cent more forest than the most direct route. Our findings suggest that this species can circumvent agricultural matrix to move among forest patches. Nevertheless, it is clear that movement of even a highly mobile species is strongly influenced by landscape disturbance. Maintaining landscape connectivity with forest corridors may be important for enhancing movement, and thus in facilitating pollen transfer. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Animal movement; Connectivity; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Translocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349128749

Pollen allergy becomes all the more relevant on taking into account that it may be responsible for the development of plant food allergy, or may even constitute the direct cause of esophageal, gastric and/or intestinal inflammation in the context of a digestive allergic process. Pollen can act as a source of allergens that induce primary sensitization in the host as a result of inhalation, with secondary allergy to plant foods containing shared allergens via a cross-reactivity mechanism. The observed pattern of plant food allergy depends on the dietary habits of the population in a given geographical setting, and on the pollination found in that setting. Pollinosis may account for the greater or lesser prevalence of allergy to certain plant foods, and for the severity of the associated reactions. Beyond the digestive tract inflammation that may result from allergy to a given food, pollinosis is also intrinsically able to generate a clinically relevant or irrelevant Th2-mediated inflammatory response at digestive level, and may even give rise to eosinophilic esophagitis. Inter-relation with the airway may also extend to the digestive tract as a consequence of the systemic response that characterizes allergic disease. © 2009 Esmon Publicidad.",Allergic asthma; Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis; Digestive allergy; Eosinophilic esophagitis; Food allergy; Pollen; Pollinosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64349108493

We present data on the communicative role of mandibular gland secretions of Meliponini that resolve a recent controversy about their importance in the laying of such trails. Volatile constituents of the mandibular glands have been erroneously thought both to elicit aggressive/defensive behaviour and to signal food source location. We studied Trigona spinipes and Scaptotrigona aff. depilis ('postica'), two sympatric species to which this hypothesis was applied. Using extracts of carefully dissected glands instead of crude cephalic extracts we analysed the substances contained in the mandibular glands of worker bees. Major components of the extracts were 2-heptanol (both species), nonanal (T. spinipes), benzaldehyde and 2-tridecanone (S. aff. depilis). The effect of mandibular gland extracts and of individual components thereof on the behaviour of worker bees near their nest and at highly profitable food sources was consistent. Independent of the amount of mandibular gland extract applied, the bees overwhelmingly reacted with defensive behaviour and were never attracted to feeders scented with mandibular gland extract or any of the synthetic chemicals tested. Both bee species are capable of using mandibular gland secretions for intra- and interspecific communication of defence and aggression and share 2-heptanol as a major pheromone compound. While confirming the role of the mandibular glands in nest defence, our experiments provide strong evidence against their role in food source signalling.",Agonistic behaviour; Communication; Eusocial bees; Semiochemicals; Trail substance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849192522

On average 5.7 seeds were obtained per pollination, with a range from 0.05 to 19.4. The heading type of B. rapa L. showed significantly higher crossability than non-heading types of B. rapa. The spontaneous outcrossing rate between B. rapa (female) and the transgenic rapeseed Ms8 × Rf3 (B. napus) (male) ranged from 0.039 to 0.406%, with an average of 0.19%. The fertilization process and the development of the hybrid seeds as shown by fluorescent staining techniques indicated that the number of adhered pollens on the stigma was reduced by 80%, the number of pollen tubes in the style was reduced by 2/3 and the fertilization time was delayed by over 20 h when pollinated with the transgenic rapeseed Ms8 × Rf3 in comparison with the bud self-pollination of B. rapa as control. About 10-70% of the interspecific hybrid embryos were aborted in the course of development. Some seeds looked cracked in mature pods, which showed germination abilities lower than 10%. The spontaneous outcrossing rates were much lower than the artificial crossability, and their survival fitness of the interspecific hybrid was very low, indicating that it should be possible to keep the adventitious presence of the off-plants under the allowed threshold, if proper measures are taken. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Brassica rapa subspecies; Crossability; Fertilization process; Germination; Outcrossing rate; Transgenic Brassica napus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349979936

They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant-pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers. Methods Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized. Key Results Ordination of flowers in a multivariate 'phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space. Conclusions The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes. © 2009 The Author.",Convergent evolution; floral traits; global; montane meadow; multidimensional scaling; mutualism; phenotype space; pollination syndromes; temperate grassland; test; tropical forest; tropical mountains,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149125291

Recognition of these shared features has led to a variety of mechanistic attempts at explanation. Here it is hypothesized that beside size thresholds and species abundances, the frequency distribution of sizes (nectar depths and proboscis lengths) will play a key role in determining observed interaction patterns. Methods To test the influence of size distributions, a new network parameter is introduced: the degree of size matching between nectar depth and proboscis length. The observed degree of size matching in a Spanish plant-pollinator web was compared with the expected degree based on joint probability distributions, integrating size thresholds and abundance, and taking the sampling method into account. Key Results Nectar depths and proboscis lengths both exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions across species and individuals. Species-based size matching was equally close for plants, independent of nectar depth, but differed significantly for pollinators of dissimilar proboscis length. The observed patterns were predicted well by a model considering size distributions across species. Observed size matching was closer when relative abundances of species were included, especially for flowers with openly accessible nectar and pollinators with long proboscises, but was predicted somewhat less successfully by the model that included abundances. Conclusions The results suggest that in addition to size thresholds and species abundances, size distributions are important for understanding interaction patterns in plant-pollinator webs. It is likely that the understanding will be improved further by characterizing for entire communities how nectar production of flowers and energetic requirements of pollinators covary with size, and how sampling methods influence the observed interaction patterns. © 2009 The Author.",body size; flower morphology; generalization; nectar; Plantpollinator community; pollination network; size matching; specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650739097

Temporal variation in pollinator availability during the season may be a major factor affecting not only seed production but also outcrossing rate of alpine plants. Methods Among local populations of Phyllodoce aleutica that experience different snowmelt regimes, flowering phenology, pollinator availability, seed-set rate, and outcrossing rate were compared with reference to the mating system (self-compatibility or heterospecific compatibility with a co-occurring congeneric species). Key Results Flowering occurred sequentially among populations reflecting snowmelt time from mid-July to late August. The visit frequency of bumble-bees increased substantially in late July when workers appeared. Both seed set and outcrossing rate increased as flowering season progressed. Although flowers were self-compatible and heterospecific compatible, the mixed-pollination experiment revealed that fertilization with conspecific, outcrossing pollen took priority over selfing and hybridization, indicating a cryptic self-incompatibility. In early snowmelt populations, seed production was pollen-limited and autogamous selfing was common. However, genetic analyses revealed that selfed progenies did not contribute to the maintenance of populations due to late-acting inbreeding depression. Conclusions Large variations in seed-set and outcrossing rates among populations were caused by the timing of pollinator availability during the season and the cryptic self-incompatibility of this species.

Motivated by the lack of accurate estimates of the size of this threat, we quantified the effect of total loss of pollinators on global agricultural production and crop production diversity. The change in pollinator dependency over 46 years was also evaluated, considering the developed and developing world separately. Methods Using the extensive FAO dataset, yearly data were compiled for 1961-2006 on production and cultivated area of 87 important crops, which we classified into five categories of pollinator dependency. Based on measures of the aggregate effect of differential pollinator dependence, the consequences of a complete loss of pollinators in terms of reductions in total agricultural production and diversity were calculated. An estimate was also made of the increase in total cultivated area that would be required to compensate for the decrease in production of every single crop in the absence of pollinators. Key Results The expected direct reduction in total agricultural production in the absence of animal pollination ranged from 3 to 8 %, with smaller impacts on agricultural production diversity. The percentage increase in cultivated area needed to compensate for these deficits was several times higher, particularly in the developing world, which comprises two-thirds of the land devoted to crop cultivation globally. Crops with lower yield growth tended to have undergone greater expansion in cultivated area. Agriculture has become more pollinator-dependent over time, and this trend is more pronounced in the developing than developed world. Conclusions We propose that pollination shortage will intensify demand for agricultural land, a trend that will be more pronounced in the developing world. This increasing pressure on supply of agricultural land could significantly contribute to global environmental change. © 2009 The Author.",Agricultural production; biotic pollination; crop diversity; cultivated area; developed world; developing world; FAO; randomization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650751235

Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested. Methods Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NJPA). Key Results Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are encouraging, explaining up to 80 % of variance among farms. However, the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model. Conclusions The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer-scale, the approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop land-use plans that promote pollination conservation and service delivery. © 2009 The Author.",Agriculture; bees; ecosystem services; land use; landscape ecology; model; pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650364227

Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction. Scope First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces 'iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling. Conclusions We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a neglected side of pollination. © 2009 The Author.",Artificial flower; Bombus; competition; floral evolution; foraging experience; iterogamy; model; pollen flow; pollinator movement; renewing resource; spatial memory; trapline foraging,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650714109

We hypothesized that this fine-scale variation in mating system reflects the tendency of bumble-bee pollinators to probe several flowers consecutively on multiflower displays. When a pollinator approaches a display, the first flower probed is likely to receive substantial outcross pollen. However, since pollen carryover in this species is limited, receipt of self pollen should increase rapidly for later flowers. Here the first direct experimental test of this hypothesis is described. Methods In order to link floral visitation sequences with selfing rates of individual flowers, replicate linear arrays were established, each composed of plants with unique genetic markers. This facilitated unambiguous assignment of paternity to all sampled progeny. A single wild bumble-bee was permitted to forage on each linear array, recording the order of floral visits on each display. Once fruits had matured, 120 fruits were harvested (four flowers from each of five floral displays in each of six arrays). Twenty-five seedlings from each fruit were genotyped and paternity was unambiguously assigned to all 3000 genotyped progeny. Key Results The order of pollinator probes on Mimulus floral displays strongly and significantly influenced selfing rates of individual fruits. Mean selfing rates increased from 21 % for initial probes to 78 % for the fourth flower probed on each display. Conclusions Striking among-flower differences in selfing rate result from increased deposition of geitonogamous (among-flower, within-display) self pollen as bumble-bees probe consecutive flowers on each floral display. The resulting heterogeneity in the genetic composition of sibships may influence seedling competition and the expression of inbreeding depression. © 2009 The Author.",Autogamy; bee; Bombus fervidus; floral display; geitonogamy; mating system; Mimulus ringens; monkeyflower; paternity analysis; pollen carryover; pollinator visitation sequence; self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650754057

Methods Eleven populations of E. ancistrophora were studied in their habitats in northern Argentina, and comparisons were made of relevant floral traits such as depth, stigma position, nectar volume and sugar concentration, and anthesis time. Diurnal and nocturnal pollinator assemblages were evaluated for populations with different floral trait combinations. Key Results Remarkable geographical variations in floral traits were recorded among the 11 populations throughout the distribution range of E. ancistrophora, with flower lengths ranging from 4·5 to 24·1 cm. Other floral traits associated with pollinator attraction also varied in a population-specific manner, in concert with floral depth. Populations with the shortest flowers showed morning anthesis and those with the longest flowers opened at dusk, whereas those with flowers of intermediate length opened at unusual times (2300-0600 h). Nectar production varied non-linearly with floral length; it was absent to low (population means up to 15 ?L) in short- to intermediate-length flowers, but was high (population means up to 170 ?L) in the longest tubed flowers. Evidence from light-trapping of moths, pollen carriage on their bodies and moth scale deposition on stigmas suggests that sphingid pollination is prevalent only in the four populations with the longest flowers, in which floral morphological traits and nectar volumes match the classic expectations for the hawkmoth pollination syndrome. All other populations, with flowers 4·5-15 cm long, were pollinated exclusively by solitary bees. Conclusions The results suggest incipient differentiation at the population level and local adaptation to either bee or hawkmoth (potentially plus bee) pollination. © 2009 The Author.",bee; Cactaceae; cactus; Echinopsis ancistrophora; floral biology; hawkmoth; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650760205

The taxonomic diversity of pollinators, biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns of pollinator exploitation, and the level of specificity of interactions were assessed in order to begin to understand the role of pollinators in promoting diversification within the genus. Methods Flower visitor and pollinator data for approx. 60 Ceropegia taxa were analysed with reference to the main centres of diversity of the genus and to a cpDNA-nrDNA molecular phylogeny of the genus. Key Results Ceropegia spp. interact with flower-visiting Diptera from at least 26 genera in 20 families, of which 11 genera and 11 families are pollinators. Size range of flies was 0·5-4·0 mm and approx. 94 % were females. Ceropegia from particular regions do not use specific fly genera or families, though Arabian Peninsula species are pollinated by a wider range of Diptera families than those in other regions. The basal-most clade interacts with the highest diversity of Diptera families and genera, largely due to one hyper-generalist taxon, C. aristolochioides subsp. deflersiana. Species in the more-derived clades interact with a smaller diversity of Diptera. Approximately 60 % of taxa are so far recorded as interacting with only a single genus of pollinators, the remaining 40 % being less conservative in their interactions. Ceropegia spp. can therefore be ecological specialists or generalists. Conclusions The genus Ceropegia has largely radiated without evolutionary shifts in pollinator functional specialization, maintaining its interactions with small Diptera. Intriguing biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns may reflect processes of regional dispersal, diversification and subsequent specialization onto a narrower range of pollinators, though some of the findings may be caused by inconsistent sampling.

Here the concept of tolerance, typically studied within the context of plant defence to foliar herbivores and pathogens, is extended to floral damage. Variation in tolerance to floral damage is examined, together with some of the mechanisms involved. Methods The study was conducted on Ipomopsis aggregata, which experiences floral damage and nectar removal by nectar-robbing bees. High levels of robbing can reduce seeds sired and produced by up to 50 %, an indirect effect mediated through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants. Using an experimental common garden with groups of I. aggregata, realized tolerance to robbing was measured. Realized tolerance included both genetic and environmental components of tolerance. It was hypothesized that both resource acquisition and storage traits, and traits involved in pollination would mitigate the negative effects of robbers. Key Results Groups of I. aggregata varied in their ability to tolerate nectar robbing. Realized tolerance was observed only through a component of male plant reproduction (pollen donation) and not through components of female plant reproduction. Some groups fully compensated for robbing while others under- or overcompensated. Evidence was found only for a pollination-related trait, flower production, associated with realized tolerance. Plants that produced more flowers and that had a higher inducibility of flower production following robbing were more able to compensate through male function. Conclusions Variation in realized tolerance to nectar robbing was found in I. aggregata, but only through an estimate of male reproduction, and traits associated with pollination may confer realized tolerance to robbing. By linking concepts and techniques from studies of plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, this work provides insight into the role of floral traits in pollinator attraction as well as plant defence. © 2009 The Author.",Compensation; herbivory; indirect effects; Ipomopsis aggregata; male reproductive success; nectar robbing; pollen donation; pollination; resistance; tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650714110

This problem is investigated here by measuring adaptive inaccuracy (phenotypic deviation from the optimum), using flower pollination as an adaptive system. Methods Adaptive accuracy is shown to have at least three distinct components, two of which are optimality (deviation of the mean from the optimum) and precision (trait variance). We then describe adaptive accuracy of both individuals and populations. Individual inaccuracy comprises the deviation of the genotypic target (the mean phenotype of a genotype grown in a range of environments) from the optimum and the phenotypic variation around that genotypic target (phenotypic imprecision). Population inaccuracy has three basic components: deviation of the population mean from the optimum, variance in the genotypic targets and phenotypic imprecision. In addition, a fourth component is proposed, namely within-population variation in the optimum. These components are directly estimable, have additive relationships, and allow exploration of the causes of adaptive inaccuracy of both individuals and populations. Adaptive accuracy of a sample of flowers is estimated, relating floral phenotypes controlling pollen deposition on pollinators to adaptive optima defined as the site most likely to get pollen onto stigmas (male inaccuracy). Female inaccuracy is defined as the deviation of the position of stigma contact from the expected location of pollen on pollinators. Key Results A surprising amount of variation in estimated accuracy within and among similar species is found. Some of this variation is generated by developmental changes in positions of stigmas or anthers during anthesis (the floral receptive period), which can cause dramatic change in accuracy estimates. There seem to be trends for higher precision and accuracy in flowers with higher levels of integration and dichogamy (temporal separation of sexual functions), and in those that have pollinators that are immobile (or immobilized) during pollen transfer. Large deviations from putative adaptive optima were observed, and these may be related to the effects of conflicting selective pressures on flowers, such as selection against self-pollination promoting herkogamy (spatial separation of pollen and stigmas). Conclusions Adaptive accuracy is a useful concept for understanding the adaptive significance of phenotypic means and variances of floral morphology within and among populations and species. Estimating and comparing the various components of adaptive accuracy can be particularly helpful for identifying the causes of inaccuracy, such as conflicting selective pressures, low environmental canalization and developmental instability. © 2009 The Author.",Adaptive accuracy; Collinsia; Dalechampia; fitness; floral precision; Linum; optimality; pollination; Stylidium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650763003

Although these aspects of natural history are well documented, the genetic mechanism(s) underlying these changes remain(s) unknown. Fig wasp olfaction is the key to host-specificity. The Or83b gene class, an unusual member of olfactory receptor family, plays a critical role in enabling the function of conventional olfactory receptors. Four Or83b orthologous genes from one pollinator (PFW) (Ceratosolen solmsi) and three non-pollinator fig wasps (NPFWs) (Apocrypta bakeri, Philotrypesis pilosa and Philotrypesis sp.) associated with one species of fig (Ficus hispida) can be used to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the fig wasp's adaptation to its host. We made a comparison of spatial tissue-specific expression patterns and substitution rates of one orthologous gene in these fig wasps and sought evidence for selection pressures. Results. A newly identified Or83b orthologous gene was named Or2. Expressions of Or2 were restricted to the heads of all wingless male fig wasps, which usually live in the dark cavity of a fig throughout their life cycle. However, expressions were widely detected in the antennae, legs and abdomens of all female fig wasps that fly from one fig to another for oviposition, and secondarily pollination. Weak expression was also observed in the thorax of PFWs. Compared with NPFWs, the Or2 gene in C. solmsi had an elevated rate of substitutions and lower codon usage. Analyses using Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F* tests indicated a non-neutral pattern of nucleotide variation in all fig wasps. Unlike in NPFWs, this non-neutral pattern was also observed for synonymous sites of Or2 within PFWs. Conclusion. The sex- and species-specific expression patterns of Or2 genes detected beyond the known primary olfactory tissues indicates the location of cryptic olfactory inputs. The specialized ecological niche of these wasps explains the unique habits and adaptive evolution of Or2 genes. The Or2 gene in C. solmsi is evolving very rapidly. Negative deviation from the neutral model of evolution reflects possible selection pressures acting on Or2 sequences of fig wasp, particularly on PFWs who are more host-specific to figs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63349101790

Seedling progenies of 11 families derived from the controlled cross-pollination of 10 pear varieties: Ya Li, Hood, Buttira Precoce Morettini (BPM), Guyot, Howell, Corella, Rogue Red, Comice, Williams' Bon Chretien (WBC) and Eldorado, were examined for their response to scab infection in a diseased orchard during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 cropping seasons. The infection was rated by a 9-point scale on diseased leaves of seedling trees with nine being most severe infection. The weather conditions in both seasons were conducive to the disease epidemics with a higher mean disease severity in 2005/06. When progenies with a score of 4 or less were classified as resistant all progeny of the two resistant (R) × resistant (R) families, Ya Li × BPM and Guyot × Hood, were resistant, and those of the R × susceptible (S) family, Eldorado × BPM, were susceptible. In the other families, however, segregation was observed with a proportion of 26-66% progeny being resistant. The segregation patterns observed in all the families can be interpreted by a model of two triallelic genes. The gene, designated as Vpa, has an allele (V pa2) conferring resistance and two alleles (V pa1 and V pa3) conferring susceptibility with V pa1 being dominant to V pa2 and V pa2 being dominant to V pa3. Similarly, the gene, designated as Vpb, has an allele (V pb2) conferring moderate resistance and two alleles (V pb1 and V pb3) conferring susceptibility with V pb1 being dominant to V pb2 and V pb2 being dominant to V pb3.

Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our results highlight the need for considering these taxon-specific differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on pollinators. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apidae; Distribution patterns; Landscape context; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61849116781

Pollinator flights between these species significantly reduced the amount of conspecific pollen deposited on Mimulus stigmas and the number of seeds in Mimulus fruits, suggesting that pollen loss is an important mechanism of competition for pollination.

Here, we examined whether a guild of c. 20 South African plant species pollinated by the long proboscid fly Prosoeca ganglbaueri (Nemestrinidae) exhibits fine-scale patterns of geographical covariation and convergent evolution at a local scale. Fly proboscis length is highly variable among sites (20-50 mm). Plant adaptation results in floral depths of plants within the guild being closely matched with the proboscis length of their fly pollinator across numerous sites. This results in patterns of divergence among allopatric populations and convergence among species within a site. The most likely evolutionary processes driving these patterns include coevolution between the fly and plants with consistent and abundant rewards, as well as one-sided evolution in rare and nonrewarding species that do not influence the coevolutionary process. Pollinator-mediated selection on spur length was confirmed for a nonrewarding orchid species in the guild by a reciprocal translocation experiment. Thus, rarer and nonrewarding species in the guild are forced to keep pace with the coevolutionary race between common rewarding flowers and flies. © 2009 New Phytologist.",Adaptation; Advergent evolution; Coevolution; Convergent evolution; Geographic mosaic of coevolution; Maladaptation; Mimicry; Pollination syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63449129524

Though Vitis vinifera (grapevine) is generally considered to be self-pollinating, it cannot be excluded that vertical gene transfer might occur. For monitoring pollen flow and out-crossing events, transgenic plants of Vitis vinifera cv. 'Dornfelder' harboring the gus-int gene were planted in the center of a field experiment in Southwest Germany in 1999. The rate of pollen dispersal was determined by pollen traps placed at radial distances of 5-150 m from the pollen-donor plants, at 1.00 and 1.80 m above ground. Transgenic pollen was evaluated by GUS staining, and could clearly be distinguished from pollen originating from non-transgenic grapevine plants. Transgenic pollen was observed up to 150 m from the pollen donors. The rate of out-crossing was determined by sampling seeds of selected grapevines at a distance of 10 m to the pollen source, and of a sector at 20 m distance, respectively, followed by GUS analysis of seedlings. The average cross-pollination rate during the experiment (2002-2004) was 2.7% at a distance of 20 m.

However, chemical messages emitted by the plant that are responsible for the encounter of mutualist partners can also be used by parasites of these mutualisms to locate their host. Each species of Ficus (Moraceae) is involved in an obligatory nursery pollination mutualism with usually one pollinating fig wasp (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae). In this interaction, volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs are responsible for the attraction of their specific pollinator. However, a large and diverse community of non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps can also parasitize this mutualism. We investigated whether the chemical message emitted by figs to attract their pollinator can promote the host specificity of non-pollinating fig wasps. We analysed the volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs of three sympatric Ficus species, namely, Ficus hispida L., Ficus racemosa L., and Ficus tinctoria G. Forster, and tested the attraction of the pollinator of F. hispida (Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr), and of one species of non-pollinating fig wasp [Philotrypesis pilosa Mayr (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae)] to scents emitted by receptive figs of these three Ficus species. Analysis of the volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs revealed that the three Ficus species could be clearly distinguished by their chemical composition. Behavioural bioassays performed in a Y-tube olfactometer showed that both pollinator and parasite were attracted only by the specific odour of F. hispida.

Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. 2. Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 × 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. 3. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. 4. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Agri-environment scheme; Bumblebees; Butterflies; Cutting; Grazing; Intensive grassland; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449231777

Thus, understanding the reproductive dynamics of scattered tree populations will be critical in determining how they can contribute to population restoration. The distance between conspecifics should be a key predictor of reproductive success, as more isolated trees are expected to receive fewer pollinator visits and experience increased transfer of self-pollen during longer pollinator foraging bouts. Further, isolation effects should be greater in species with less mobile pollinators. Here we contrast the effects of plant isolation on reproductive success of two species of eucalypt ""paddock trees"", Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus leucoxylon, with insect- and bird-pollination, respectively. Seed production was not affected by tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species and once outliers were removed, neither was there an effect on germination rate. As somatic mutations may bias outcrossing rate estimates, we initially screened our microsatellite markers for mutations but found no variation in microsatellite profiles throughout the canopy of trees. Individual outcrossing rates did not decline with increasing tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species, though there was considerable variation in these rates at large distances, suggesting that pollination becomes unreliable with increasing tree isolation. We found that pollination distances have likely increased in tree species in agricultural landscapes, and that this may be facilitated by introduced honeybees in the case of E. camaldulensis. We therefore suggest that even isolated trees of these species produce seed of sufficient quantity and quality to contribute to population restoration. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Many wasps mix routine inbreeding with a little random mating. This random mating is most common when all local sibmating opportunities are exhausted and dispersal is the only way males can further increase their fitness. The males of the pollinating fig wasp, Platyscapa awekei, are slightly different in that they disperse before all sibmating opportunities have been exhausted. To see if this is a response to inbreeding depression we quantify inbreeding depression by comparing females' life time reproductive success to their heterozygosity at multiple microsatellite loci. We find that a female wasp's heterozygosity is an accurate predictor of her inbreeding coefficient and that P. awekei females actually seem to suffer from outbreeding depression and possibly from a little inbreeding depression. Male dispersal is thus not a means to effect the optimal mating system, but more likely a mechanism to reduce competition among brothers. The number of mature offspring a female produces depends on her own heterozygosity and not on that of the offspring, and may be determined by egg and gall quality. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Fig wasp; Hymenoptera; Inbreeding depression; Maternal effect; Mixed mating; Outbreeding depression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63149182581

A unique opportunity to explore this question is presented by the invasion into Africa of a plant adapted for pollination by hovering hummingbirds. Like other hover-pollinated plants of the New World, the flowers of the tree tobacco Nicotiana glauca lack perches and are oriented towards open space. We find that Old World nectarivores, especially the malachite sunbird, Nectarinia famosa, hover 80% of the time when taking nectar from these flowers. They hover for up to 30 s, and are able to sustain this hovering lifestyle in an area where native nectar plants are absent. Nicotiana glauca greatly increases the local abundance of sunbirds compared with uninvaded areas. In turn, flowers visited by sunbirds formed significantly more capsules and set significantly more seed than sunbird-excluded flowers, possibly facilitating the invasion. The results suggest a prominent role for plant, rather than bird traits in determining the occurrence of hover-pollination, begging the question of why plants adapted for hover pollination do not occur outside the New World. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849241984

According to this model, the most profound changes in floral traits (such as morphology, color, patterning and scent) occur when plants undergo adaptive shifts between pollinator classes. We tested this model through investigations of geographical variation in floral form and pollinator assemblages in the South African annual daisy Gorteria diffusa. This species has elaborate insect-like ornaments on the capitulum, which attract bee flies belonging to the genus Megapalpus. We found unprecedented levels of geographically structured intraspecific variation and identified 14 discrete forms that vary in the morphology and ornamentation of the capitulum. This variation is not due to phenotypic plasticity because differences among forms were maintained in plants grown from seed in a common garden experiment. Contrary to predictions from the pollinator-shift model, all populations, regardless of floral phenotype, were pollinated primarily by a single species of Megapalpus bee fly.

Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) has great potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their flowers, including bumble bees (Bomhus spp. ), and, in the Americas, two genera of specialist ground nesting bees (Peponapis and Xenoglossa). We examined the effects of several key farm management practices and landscape variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on 20 farms in Virginia and Maryland during summer 2006. We evaluated bee abundance with respect to tillage, irrigation practices, soil properties, natural habitat (forest and grassland), flowering crop, and disturbed areas. Additionally, we examined nest site preference (within or outside of crop areas) of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) at one farm and in a large screenhouse. We found P. pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop areas and near the vines and leaves of their host plant. Although these bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage depth, we did not find a tillage effect on their abundance at flowers. We found a negative effect of soil clay content (R 2 = 0.24, P = 0.03) and a positive effect of irrigation (F 1 15= 12.2; P &lt; 0.001) on P. pruinosa abundance. Using published data on pollinator visitation requirements, we found wild bee densities were sufficient to fully pollinate all pumpkin flowers on 13-17 of the 20 farms studied. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Cucurbita; Irrigation; Peponapis; Sustainable agriculture; Tillage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349103619

Nicotiana attenuata's ppHS is known not to function in herbivore defense. NappHS transcripts are abundant in flowers, particularly in pistils, and when two N. attenuata accessions from Utah and Arizona were transformed to silence NappHS by RNAi (IRsys), seed capsule production and seed number per capsule were reduced in both accessions. These reductions in reproductive performance could not be attributed to impaired pollen or ovule viability; hand-pollination of all IRsys lines of both accessions restored seed production per capsule to levels found in wild-type plants. Rather, changes in flower morphology that decreased the efficiency of self-pollination are likely responsible: IRsys plants of both accessions have flowers with pistils that protrude beyond their anthers. Because these changes in flower morphology are reminiscent of CORONATINE- INSENSITIVE1-silenced N. attenuata plants, we measured jasmonates (JAs) and their biosynthetic transcripts in different floral developmental stages, and found levels of JA-isoleucine (Ile)/leucine and threonine deaminase transcripts, which are abundant in wild-type pistils, to be significantly reduced in IRsys buds and flowers. Threonine deaminase supplies Ile for JA-Ile biosynthesis, and we propose that ppHS mediates JA signaling during flower development and thereby changes flower morphology. These results suggest that the function of ppHS family members in N. attenuata may have diversified to modulate flower morphology and thereby outcrossing rates in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249174476

Pollination in such systems is unmanaged and is usually incidental, supported by nearby ecosystems. One of the reasons of not managing pollination is the lack of understanding of its economic value. The ""public-good"" nature of pollination in these systems also discourages individual initiatives intended to conserve pollinators. We evaluate the economic returns from bee pollination in small-holder farming systems. To do this we apply the factor of production method, a form of revealed preferences methods available for valuing ecosystem services. Our analyses show that bee pollination enhances the yield of most crops grown in the farmland and improves immensely the quality of produce. Almost 40% of the annual value of crops under consideration represented the net returns derived from bee pollination. More than 99% of this benefit is attributed to pollination by feral bees. We provide in-depth valuation of pollination service and discuss applicability and limitations of the factor of production method in developing countries. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Economic valuation; Factor of production; Pollinators; Yield enhancement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349111331

Figs also shelter numerous non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) that exploit the fig-pollinator mutualism. Only a few NPFW species can enter figs to oviposit, they do not belong to the pollinating lineage Agaonidae. The internally ovipositing non-agaonid fig wasps can efficiently pollinate the Ficus species that were passively pollinated. However, there is no study to focus on the net effect of these internally ovipositing non-agaonid wasps in actively pollinated Ficus species. By collecting the data of fig wasp community and conducting controlled experiments, our results showed that internally ovipositing Diaziella bizarrea cannot effectively pollinate Ficus glaberrima, an actively pollinated monoecious fig tree. Furthermore, D. bizarrea failed to reproduce if they were introduced into figs without Eupristina sp., the regular pollinator, as all the figs aborted. Furthermore, although D. bizarrea had no effect on seed production in shared figs, it significantly reduced the number of Eupristina sp. progeny emerging from them. Thus, our experimental evidence shows that reproduction in Diaziella depends on the presence of agaonid pollinators, and whether internally ovipositing parasites can act as pollinators depends on the host fig's pollination mode (active or passive). Overall, this study and others suggest a relatively limited mutualistic role for internally ovipositing fig wasps from non-pollinator (non-Agaonidae) lineages. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Agaonidae; Diaziella; Ficus glaberrima; Fig wasp; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63949083079

Pollinator specificity in six of the nine described species in the Chiloglottis gunnii Lindl. complex was investigated by using field pollinator-choice tests, with Chiloglottis taxa translocated within and among biogeographical regions. Specific pollinators revealed the existence of five undescribed cryptic taxa in the C. gunnii complex, three within C. pluricallata D.L.Jones and two within C. valida D.L.Jones, in addition to the six described species. Of the 11 Chiloglottis taxa, 10 had a single thynnine-wasp pollinator throughout their sometimes large distributions, whereas one, C. valida, had a second pollinator in parts of its distribution. Eleven pollinators belonged to the genus Neozeleboria and one to Eirone. Pollinator-choice testing showed that cross-attraction of pollinators occurs between three geographically isolated Chiloglottis taxa on the New South Wales (NSW) New England Tableland and taxa in the South Eastern Highlands of NSW and Victoria. The data suggested there is sharing of chemical attractants and supported the recognition of at least five odour types within Chiloglottis, each encompassing one to three orchid taxa and their pollinators. The following two broad generalisations are made: (1) there is no cross-attraction of pollinators among sympatric Chiloglottis species, i.e. sympatric orchid taxa do not share attractant odours; and (2) all Chiloglottis species have different specific pollinators, although they may share attractant odours allopatrically. Some 28 thynnine-wasp species were attracted as minor non-pollinating responders to Chiloglottis taxa; five of these were pollinators of other Chiloglottis species. These wasps were much more taxonomically diverse than the pollinators, belonging to six genera, and suggest that some orchid-odour components are widely shared within the sex pheromones of the Thynninae. © CSIRO 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63149115316

In this study, we examined the effects of proximity to a habitat edge, created by a visitor pathway, on reproductive success of the orchids Phaius delavayi and Ponerorchis chusua within the Huanglong National Park, China. Parallel transects were established at different distances from the pathway to test the effects of proximity to the pathway on male and female reproductive success in two consecutive years. For Phaius delavayi, percentage pollinarium removal and percentage fruit set showed significant variation between transects in both years, with plants in transects closer to the pathway having lower reproductive success. P. chusua showed the same trends except for pollinarium removal in one year. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity to the pathway, which is used by a large number of visitors every day throughout the orchids' flowering seasons, interfered with pollinator activity, depressing male and female reproductive success in both species. The impacts on reproductive success were significant for plants within approximately 10 meters of the pathway. Such edge effects may be common, and may need to be considered when designing nature reserves in which visitor activity is encouraged. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",Disturbance; Edge effect; Fruit set; Nature reserve management; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pollinarium removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59649126462

In total, 92% of insects caught were dipterans; however, most of these were small and did not contribute significantly to pollination. For the majority of taxa, which have short mouthparts and therefore need to intrude themselves into the flower while feeding on nectar, there was a highly significant relationship between body length and the number of E. regnans pollen grains carried on the body. Mean pollen loads ranged from 20 grains per insect for sepsid flies to 84000 for large tachinid flies. An index of pollen-deposition potential, which is based on population size and pollen load, suggested that the larger tachinid, calliphorid and syrphid flies were the most important pollen vectors and that larger sphecid wasps also played a significant role. Many taxa appeared to contribute little to pollination because they were uncommon and/or did not carry large quantities of pollen. A convention is proposed whereby groups are weighted according to their contribution to total pollen-deposition potential.

Five pollination treatments were compared in a 2-year evaluation (2005-06) including hornfaced bees, honeybees, bumblebees, native pollinators, and no pollinators. Enclosed pollination cages were constructed around mature, field-grown highbush blueberry plants to prevent mixing of pollination treatments. Each cage contained a single pollination treatment, except for the open pollination and no pollination treatments. The five pollination treatments were replicated three times inside separate pollination field cages on the farm. Three branches per plant were randomly selected that had a minimum of five fruiting buds and blossom number was recorded. After pollination occurred, the cages were removed to allow the berries to ripen. Ripe fruits were picked weekly over the fruiting season (July to August) in each year (2005 and 2006), with the fruit from each sample being counted and weighed. Blossom number was compared to fruit number and weight to determine efficiency of pollination as a result of the pollination treatments.

Paradoxically, accumulated evidence from controlled experiments demonstrates that olive is partially self-incompatible and that cross-pollination increases yield and fruit quality in this wind-pollinated crop. With the aim of assessing cross-pollination deficit in large plots of the most widespread olive oil cultivar in Spain, fruit set was compared in two solid orchards of 'Picual' in response to self-, open-, and artificial cross-pollination. In both orchards, 'Picual' behaved as a self-incompatible cultivar with reduced fruit set under self-pollination (index of selfincompatibility = 0.21). However, cross-pollination rarely increased fruit set in comparison with open-pollination. Bagging experiments demonstrated that open-pollination provided enough cross-pollen to induce high levels of fruit set. The increase in fruit set in response to mechanical application of cross-pollen was limited to the trees directly receiving the pollen flow and only in one orchard. Consistently, airborne pollen concentration after a single terrestrial application significantly fits a decay curve with a short dispersal. In contrast with the limited dispersal of single mechanical applications, open-pollination results suggest that trees from plantations at least 250 to 500maway are acting as unsuspected pollenizers. This is probably taking place to some extent in most traditional olive districts in Spain, and it explains why farmers have never demanded pollination designs in this crop. Modern homogeneous plantations can, however, change this situation dramatically and give rise to pollination deficits.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67049158493

The shrub's flowers are typical zygomorphic pea flowers with hidden floral rewards and reproductive structures. These flowers require special manipulation for insect access. A range of insects visited the flowers, although bees are predicted to be the principle pollinators based on their frequency on the flowers and their exclusive ability to operate the wing and keel petals to access the reproductive structures.

To quantify this hierarchical variation, we examined outcrossing rates at the seed stage in five populations of Magnolia stellata, a self-compatible, insect-pollinated and protogynous tree species. For this purpose, we sampled 1498 seeds within 204 fruits obtained from 56 individuals of the five populations, determined genotypes of the sampled seeds and maternal individuals at six polymorphic microsatellite loci, then estimated outcrossing rates and their variance components at four hierarchical levels (fruits, individuals, populations and species) using a nested analysis of variance-type linear model with a Bayesian approach. The species-level outcrossing rate was 0.730 (95% credible interval, 0.595-0.842), indicating that this species has a mixed mating system. Outcrossing rates were not significantly different among populations, but were significantly different among individuals within populations. Variance components at the levels of individual and fruit were statistically supported and were highest for the former. Thus, factors influencing outcrossing rates at the individual level, such as differences in flowering phenology and early-stage inbreeding depression, appear to have important effects within these M. stellata populations, but not among them.

For yield, backcross populations had higher heterosis estimates than the other population types. For seed protein content, mean MPH ranged from -1% to +7%, and mean HPH from -4% to +7%. For oil content, mean MPH ranged from -10% to +6%, and mean HPH from -13% to +3%. Negative heterosis values were observed, indicating that a large number of different parental combinations need to be evaluated to identify the superior heterotic combinations.

Although this could be a consequence simply of lower extinction rates in the Cape, most researchers have invoked high rates of ecological speciation, driven by unique aspects of the Cape environment, as the primary explanation for this richness. To assess these ideas, we analyzed the frequencies of ecological shifts among 188 sister species pairs obtained from molecular phylogenies of eight Cape clades. Ecological shifts were evident in 80% of sister species pairs, with general habitat, pollinator, and fire-survival strategy shifts being especially frequent. Contrary to an established idea that shifts in soil type are frequently associated with speciation of Cape taxa, these shifts were relatively rare, occurring in just 17% of species pairs. More cases of sister species divergence are accompanied solely by floral than by vegetative diversification, suggesting an important role for pollinator-driven speciation. In an analysis of two large orchid genera that have radiated in both the Cape and the rest of southern Africa, the frequency of ecological shifts (general habitat, soil type, altitude and flowering time), did not differ between sister species pairs in the Cape region and those outside it. Despite suggestions that Cape plants tend to have small range sizes and show fine-scale patterns of speciation, range size did not differ significantly between species in the Cape and those outside it. We conclude that ecological speciation is likely to have been important for radiation of the Cape flora, but there is no evidence as yet for special ""Cape"" patterns of ecological speciation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the breeding systems of alpine plants are likely to be diverse and vary from one geographical area to another. The reproductive characteristics of Nastanthus spathulatus (Calyceraceae) and Rhodophiala rhodolirion (Amaryllidaceae), species with contrasting floral morphology, were studied in the high Andes of Chile, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. Natural and supplemental open pollination, and cross pollination and self-pollination trials were carried out in the field. Flower visitors were quantified by field and video observations. Both species had high outcrossing properties, and Nastanthus was strongly self-incompatible. Rhodophiala could form some seed by self-pollination, but fruit and seed sets were much lower after self-pollination compared with outcrossing. The phenology and flower/inflorescence forms of these species supported the view that alpine flowers are comparatively long lived and that the floral display contributes to a large proportion of the plant biomass. Rhodophiala was well attended by a native bee species (Megachile sauleyi) that was appropriately sized for efficient pollination. Although no flower visitors were observed on Nastanthus and wind pollination was discarded experimentally, a high proportion of the flowers produced seeds under natural pollination. Therefore, the seed set was not severely pollen limited in these species. Including previously published information, breeding systems are now known for 12 species on this Mediterranean alpine site and current knowledge suggests an emphasis on outcrossing breeding systems. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Breeding system; Mediterranean alpine; Nastanthus spathulatus; Pollination; Rhodophiala rhodolirion; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68849084798

Conversely, all our measures of reproduction - number of fruits/plant, proportion of quadrats with fruiting plants, number of fruits/node - indicated reduced vigor, as in the same intervals these measures declined and did not recover. Soil temperature was highly correlated with juvenile and adult density. Measuring additional biotic and abiotic factors should be incorporated into future monitoring. Local-scale abiotic factors that could influence variation in adult and juvenile density include light levels, drought, distance to cold air vents, soil moisture, nutrient levels, and humidity.

This can generate an evolutionary conflict if the use of pollen as food by pollinators reduces the number of gametes available for cross-fertilization. Heteranthery, the production of two or more stamen types by individual flowers reduces this conflict by allowing different stamens to specialize in 'pollinating' and 'feeding' functions. We used experimental studies of Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae) and theoretical models to investigate this 'division of labour' hypothesis. Flight cage experiments with pollinating bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) demonstrated that although feeding anthers are preferentially manipulated by bees, pollinating anthers export more pollen to other flowers. Evolutionary stability analysis of a model of pollination by pollen consumers indicated that heteranthery evolves when bees consume more pollen than should optimally be exchanged for visitation services, particularly when pollinators adjust their visitation according to the amount of pollen collected. © 2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",Bee pollination; Bombus impatiens; Evolutionary stable strategy; Heteranthery; Nectarless flowers; Solanum rostratum; Stamen functions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62449167336

In this study we relate the combined distributions of species traits of plants and animals to disturbance regimes in chestnut forests of southern Switzerland affected by regular winter fires. We used co-inertia analysis for combining the trait response of 471 invertebrate species (117 001 individuals) and 81 plant species at 23 sites with different fire and cutting histories. Trait response was assessed by calculating the variation in weighted mean traits averaged over the communities and by using mean traits in multivariate analyses. The analysis showed a strong association between plant and animal traits under fire constraints (Monte-Carlo test, p=0.0045). Plants and animal distributions show parallel trends in responses to fire which selects traits relating to persistence (ability to survive), resilience (ability to recover) and mobility. Warmth-demanding insects, herbivores, flying carnivores and pollinators were associated with recent fires, as were annual, ruderal and light-demanding plant species with long flowering duration. Small arthropods feeding on dead wood and those with narrow habitat requirements were associated with low fire frequency and unburnt sites, as were competitive plants with large seeds favoring moist sites. The spatial association between plant and animal traits reflected adaptations that promote survival in the disturbance regime, while the disturbance acts as an environmental filter on the distribution and assemblage of the trait values within communities. This combined analysis of plant and invertebrate traits distributions illustrates how community and ecosystem responses can be monitored and the results generalized across localities and disturbance types. Analyses of traits that cross trophic levels provide powerful and promising tools for validating management procedures and controlling ecosystem functions. © 2009 Ecography.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66149167604

This was investigated in seven plant-hummingbird assemblages on the West Indian islands of Grenada, Dominica and Puerto Rico. We report all hummingbird and insect pollinators of 49 hummingbird-pollinated plant species, as well as six quantitative and semi-quantitative floral characters that determine visitor restriction, attraction and reward. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis, we show that hummingbird-pollinated plants in the West Indies separate in floral phenotypic space into two gradients-one associated with the abiotic environment and another with hummingbird size. Plants pollinated by large, long-billed hummingbirds had flowers with long corolla tube, large amounts of nectar and showy orange-red colouration. These attracted few or no insect species, whereas plants pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds were frequently pollinated by insects, particularly lepidopterans. The separation of plants related to environmental factors showed that species in the wet and cold highlands produced large amounts of dilute nectar, possessed no or a weak odour, and were associated with few insects, particularly few hymenopterans, compared to plants in the dry and warm lowlands. The most specialised hummingbird-pollinated plants are found in the West Indian highlands where they are pollinated by mainly large, long-billed hummingbirds. At the other extreme, highly generalised plants growing in the dry and warm lowlands are pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds and numerous insect species. This illustrates that, even within the hummingbird-pollinated flora, pollination syndrome and the degree of specialisation may vary tremendously depending on pollinator morphology and environment. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Floral phenotype; Insect pollinator; Ornithophilous syndrome; Plant-pollinator interaction; Specialisation gradient,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149101084

The objective of this study was to understand the principal constraints on sexual reproduction in small fragmented populations of a rare clonal self-incompatible plant.MethodsThe pollinator spectrum, diversity of flower colour, natural pollination and fruit-set levels of L. borealis were examined in Scotland. Artificially crossed seed production was compared within and between different flower colour types and patches.Key ResultsLinnaea borealis was pollinated by a diverse spectrum of insect species and the principal pollinators were muscid, syrphid and empid flies which mostly moved only small distances (<0·25 m) between flowers when foraging. Natural pollination levels were high, indicating high pollinator effectiveness, but fruit set was very low in most patches. Flower colour diversity was low in most patches and only those with a diversity of flower colour types had high fruiting success. Pollination experiments showed L. borealis to be highly self-incompatible and artificial crosses within and between patches and flower colour types confirmed that low fruit success was the result of a lack of compatible mates and limited pollen movement between them. Evidence of isolation from pollen exchange was apparent at as little as 6 m and severe at 30 m and beyond.ConclusionsLimited mate availability and isolation from pollen exchange compromise the reproductive success of fragmented populations of L. borealis in Scotland. A diversity of compatible mates situated within close proximity (<6 m) is the key requirement to ensure high natural fruiting success. This study emphasizes that an understanding of the breeding system, pollinator spectrum and potential for interconnectivity via pollinator movement are fundamental to identify isolation distances and to establish when conservation intervention is necessary for rare species.",Clonal; Fragmented populations; Isolation; Linnaea borealis; Pollination; Reproductive failure; Self-incompatible,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64949184737

Figs are pollinated by their highly specific pollinating fig wasps, and the pollinating fig wasps are raised within the syconia of figs. Recent studies indicated a difference between monoecious and dioecious figs in the dispersal range of pollinating wasps, which has potential consequences for gene flow. In this study, we detected the gene-flow pattern of the dioecious climbing fig, Ficus pumila L. var. pumila, at both local and regional scales. At the local scale, spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated strong genetic structure at short distances, a pattern of limited gene flow. This result was also supported by a high inbreeding coefficient (F IS = 0.287) and significant substructuring (F ST = 0.060; P &lt; 0.001). Further analysis indicated that the effective gene dispersal range was 1,211 m, and the relative contribution of seed dispersal was smaller than that of pollen dispersal. The inferred effective range of pollen dispersal ranged from 989 to 1,712 m, while the effective seed dispersal range was less than 989 m. Lack of long-distance dispersal agents may explain the limited seed dispersal. The high density of receptive fig trees was the most likely explanation for limited pollen dispersal, and the position of syconia and relatively low wind speed beneath the canopy may contribute to this phenomenon. At the regional scale, significant negative correlations (kinship coefficient F ij ranging from -0.038 to -0.071) existed in all comparisons between the studied population and other populations, and the assignment test grouped almost all individuals of the studied population into a distinct cluster. Asynchronous flowering on the regional scale, which provides a barrier for the pollinating wasps to fly from the studied population to the other populations, is probably responsible for the limited gene flow on the regional scale. © 2008 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.",Assignment test; Ficus pumila L. var. pumila; Microsatellites; Pollen and seed dispersal; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62949148693

This vegetation type has suffered significant decline, mainly due to the early ploughing of stubbles associated with the intensification of agriculture. In the present study, the floristic composition of this community is assessed based on 213 phytosociological records, and its distribution in the past ten years in western Hungary is mapped. Sixty-five percent of the species are of Eurasian, European and Mediterranean elements, and the largest proportion of the species are spring-germinating summer annuals. The proportion of insect-pollinated plant species is approximately 70%, and the species composition also offers significant seed food sources for farmland birds, e.g. Coturnix coturnix and Perdix perdix. Therefore this community should deserve a high conservation priority for biodiversity. The factors that offer the greatest threats to the continuing existence of this community type are intensive agricultural management and the increasing spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia. © 2009 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Farmland birds; Pollinators; Rare weeds; Stubble-honey,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67049088019

Although transgenic crops offer benefits, several risks have been identified associated with their cultivation. One such risk is their potential for hybridization with wild species, and weed-related species, and the possible escape and subsequent introgression of the transgenes into these species. Transgenic wheat varieties are being successfully developed and field-tested, primarily on herbicide-tolerant wheat. If genetically modified herbicide-tolerant wheat is commercialized in the near future this may result in the escape of the inserted gene from the crop and its incorporation into closely related wild species. This fact could give a competitive advantage to the recipients. For risk assessment purposes it is necessary to determine the frequency of crop-wild transgene flow and the fertility of hybrids. Most wheat-wild hybridization studies have been conducted with the purpose of breeding with wheat acting as the female parent in crosses, but very limited information is available focused on hybrid production with wheat as the male parent. Here, we studied (1) the potential hybridization between wheat and the wild related Aegilops biuncialis, and (2) the fertility of the hybrids. Hybridization was quantified in crossing experiments over 5 years in a greenhouse using three wheat cultivars as pollen donors and emasculated plants of one A. biuncialis population as pollen recipients. Hybridization was estimated as the ratio of number of seeds set to the number of flowers pollinated in percentage terms. Our results show that hybrids between wheat and A. biuncialis are formed easily, with hybridization rates ranging from 8.5 to 75%. The fertility of the hybrids, measured as the number of seeds per spikelet (%), was also evaluated by self-pollination and by backcrossing. Most of the hybrids were self-sterile but 11 F seeds were obtained from 191 A. biuncialis-wheat hybrids. However, backcrossing seeds were found in all BC combinations at average rates of 3.7% (0-19.6%) for greenhouse experiments, and 4.6% (0-28.9%) for field experiments. In subsequent generations, although few plants were available, BCF exhibited a certain degree of fertility, up to 3.57% with the cultivar Chinese Spring. F and BC were also checked for resistance to the herbicide difenzoquat that was present in the parental wheat, while A. biuncialis was susceptible. Difenzoquat resistance was maintained in the F hybrids and also in the derived BC plants. This information on hybridization and fertility of the first A. biuncialis-wheat hybrid generations could be an initial step to assess the relative advantage of hybridization in the adaptive ability of A. biuncialis and hybrid derivatives and the impact thereof on the environment and agricultural system. This needs to be studied in depth when wheat and A. biuncialis share habitat. © 2008 INRA EDP Sciences.",Aegilops biuncialis; Difenzoquat; Gene transfer; GMO; Herbicide; Herbicide tolerance; Hybrid fertility; Interspecific hybridization; Risk assessment; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349140210

However, few studies have examined the frequency dependence of RI, despite of its key importance to invasiveness. Here, we report for the first time frequency-dependent RI in a pair of native and alien dandelions: Taraxacum japonicum and T. officinale, respectively. Taraxacum japonicum has been displaced rapidly by the alien congener T. officinale in Japan and its causal mechanism are still poorly understood. Field observations revealed that the seed-set of natives decreased substantially as the proportion of alien neighbors increased. Subsequently, in a field experiment, the removal of alien flowers only greatly increased the seed-set of natives. We synthesized these results with existing theoretical models of RI and concluded that RI, which is mediated by strong frequency dependence, is presumably responsible for the displacement of T. japonicum by T. officinale. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Alien congener; Frequency dependence; Interspecific pollen transfer; Reproductive interference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449157880

Closely related species exist in Japan where the unrestricted import and use of B. terrestris has resulted in the establishment of wild colonies. Laboratory studies previously showed that B. terrestris and Japanese native species can copulate and produce fertilized eggs. Although these eggs do not hatch, the interspecific mating can cause a serious reproductive disturbance to native bumblebees. In this study, we determined the frequencies of interspecies mating between B. terrestris males and native bumblebee queens in the wild on the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu by analyzing the DNA sequences of spermatozoa stored in spermathecae of native queens. We found that 20.2% of B. hypocrita hypocrita queens and 30.2% of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queens had spermatozoa of B. terrestris males in their spermathecae. Given that a Bombus queen generally mates only once in her life, such high frequencies of interspecific mating with B. terrestris pose serious threats to the populations of native bumblebees in Japan. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Interspecific mating; Invasive alien species; Reproductive disturbance; Spermatheca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63949086584

Effectiveness of hedgerows as barriers to drift depends mainly on canopy density (that can be estimated through optical porosity) and wind speed. When optical porosity is low, the hedgerow can intercept a significant amount of spray drift and act as an effective barrier, but the intercepted pesticide can negatively affect the beneficial arthropods living there. A drift model was used to simulate drift in a hedgerow-vineyard system, and a deposition distribution model was used to calculate the pesticide spatial pattern distribution on a hedgerow with different optical porosity and wind speed conditions. The possible ecotoxicologtcal effects were estimated for 28 active ingredients with different median lethal rates for two nontarget arthropods, Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri. A spatialized risk assessment for a hedgerow is suggested to improve procedures based on application rate, standard drift, and vegetation distribution values, as in the hazard quotient approach. An alternative method for calculation of the exposure is also proposed, with a step-by-step example of a toxicity/exposure ratio calculation. The results highlighted the importance of the spatial pattern of drift and proved that a hedgerow can be an effective barrier against spray drift. Analysis of the toxicity/exposure ratio values showed that a hedgerow can continue its shelter and feeding function for nontarget arthropods when low-toxicity pesticides are used, there is no significant wind interference, or both. © 2009 SETAC.",Aphidius rhopalosiphi; Hedgerow; Pesticide drift; Risk assessment; Typhlodromus pyri,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64849098631

Hormones are known to synchronize these two processes, but the role of each hormone, and the mechanism by which they interact, are still unknown. Here we show that auxin and gibberellins (GAs) act in a hierarchical scheme. The synthetic reporter construct DR5:GFP showed that fertilization triggered an increase in auxin response in the ovules, which could be mimicked by blocking polar auxin transport. As the application of GAs did not affect auxin response, the most likely sequence of events after fertilization involves auxin-mediated activation of GA synthesis. We have confirmed this, and have shown that GA biosynthesis upon fertilization is localized specifically in the fertilized ovules. Furthermore, auxin treatment caused changes in the expression of GA biosynthetic genes similar to those triggered by fertilization, and also restricted to the ovules. Finally, GA signaling was activated in ovules and valves, as shown by the rapid downregulation of the fusion protein RGA-GFP after pollination and auxin treatment. Taken together, this evidence suggests a model in which fertilization would trigger an auxin-mediated promotion of GA synthesis specifically in the ovule. The GAs synthesized in the ovules would be then transported to the valves to promote GA signaling and thus coordinate growth of the silique. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Arabidopsis; Auxin; Crosstalk; Fruit-set; Gibberellin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64249094191

Although hypopi, the dispersal stages of C. krombeini, are known to disperse from nest to nest by hitchhiking on Osmia cornifrons adults, we observed that they might disperse in other ways too in commercial orchards. This study was conducted to elucidate the nest-to-nest dispersal mechanisms of C. krombeini hypopi. We tested three potential dispersal mechanisms of C. krombeini other than phoresy by O. cornifrons: (1) dispersal by walking from nest to entrances of nearby nests, (2) dispersal by walking from nest to nest through emergence holes made by parasitic wasps on nests, and (3) dispersal by being unloaded and uptaken to and from flowers by O. cornifrons. Results of this study showed that C. krombeini hypopi could disperse from a nest to nearby nests by walking through nest entrances and holes made by parasitic wasps of O. cornifrons. Although 0.06% of C. krombeini hypopi on blueberry flowers were picked up by O. cornifrons, they were not able to be unloaded to flowers from O. cornifrons and no hypopi could inhabit or survive on blueberry flowers. This indicated no or very low chance of C. krombeini hypopi dispersal via blueberry flowers.

It can be an alternative crop adapted to part-time farming and can also be used to regenerate vegetation in areas with a mild climate and erosion problems. Four Spanish carob cultivars were examined (Banya de Cabra, Duraio, Matalafera, and Rojal) to determine the one that performed the best for planting new orchards in northeastern Spain (Catalonia). The trees in this rain-fed trial (average rainfall of 500 mm) were planted in 1986 using seedling rootstocks that were budded in 1987. The trees were trained using the free-vase system and were spaced 8 × 9 m (138 trees/ha including 12% pollinators). The results showed that 'Rojal' was the earliest bearing cultivar. However, no significant differences were observed for cumulative pod production 18 years after budding. With respect to cumulative seed yield, 'Duraio' had the highest production (95 kg/tree). The lowest tree vigor (trunk cross-section) was observed in 'Matalafera'. Rojal trees produced the largest pods (average fruit weight of 18.9 g) and lowest seed content (11.8%), while 'Banya de Cabra' and 'Duraio' produced the smallest fruit (weighing 15.3 and 16.2 g, respectively) with the highest seed content (15.2% and 17.3%, respectively). Gum content, expressed as a percentage of the dry weight, was highest in 'Duraio' (56.9%) and was lowest in 'Rojal' (54.1%).

Pollination is mainly due to the action of different insects, such as the bumblebee and the honeybee. These important ecological and economic roles have led to widespread concern over the recent decline in pollinator populations that has been detected in many regions of the world. While this decline has been attributed in some cases to changes in the use of agricultural land, the effects of parasites could play a significant role in the reduction of these populations. For the first time, we describe here the presence of Nosema ceranae, an emerging honeybee pathogen, in three species of Argentine native bumblebees. A total of 455 bumblebees belonging to six species of genus Bombus were examined. PCR results showed that three of the species are positive to N. ceranae (Bombus atratus, Bombus morio and Bombus bellicosus).

Genetic variation in, and correlations among, three Kraft pulpwood traits (diameter at breast height, basic density and near-infrared-predicted cellulose content) and three 12-mm wood-core shrinkage traits (recoverable collapse, net shrinkage and gross shrinkage) were examined, utilising data from two 9-year-old first-generation progeny trials in Tasmania. These trials contained approximately 400 open-pollinated families (over 100 of which were sampled for wood properties) representing three central-Victorian E. nitens races. Significant genetic variation at the race and/or within-race level was identified in all traits. Within races, relative levels of additive genetic variation were higher for shrinkage traits, although narrow-sense heritabilities were lower and the expression of genetic variation less stable across sites than for other wood property traits. Heterogeneous intertrait genetic correlations were identified across sites between growth and some wood property traits. However, where significant, genetic correlations indicated that within-race selection for growth would adversely affect core basic density and all core shrinkage traits. Furthermore, results based on cores suggested that within-race selection for higher basic density would favourably impact on cellulose content and collapse but selection for either higher basic density or cellulose content would adversely affect net shrinkage. Most within-race genetic variation in gross shrinkage appeared to be due to genetic variation in collapse. The implications of these results for sawn timber breeding will depend on the strength of genetic correlations between core traits and rotation-age objective traits and objective trait economic weights. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Cellulose content; Collapse; Density; Eucalyptus nitens; Genetic correlation; Genetic variation; Growth; Heritability; Pulpwood; Sawn timber; Shrinkage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61349125500

Microspore development in the Shindai3 was normal until the tetrad stage, but separation of the microspores from the tetrads was not observed even after callose had been degraded. In contrast to the microspore stage in a male-fertile tree, amorphous substances were observed around tetrads in the Shindai3, and the amount of the amorphous substance increased from the middle of November to the middle of December. The substances are hypothesized to prevent the separation of individual microspores from tetrads by inducing adhesion between microspore cells within the tetrad or enclosing the tetrads. The form of the tetrads in the Shindai3 was maintained until just before the pollen dispersal season, but they ultimately degenerated.

However, which morphological traits initiate increased self-pollination and which are accumulated after self-fertilization establishes is poorly understood. Because the expression of floral traits may depend on the conditions experienced by an individual during flower development, investigation of changes in mating system should also account for environmental and developmental factors. Here, early stages in the evolution of self-pollination are investigated by comparing floral traits among Brazilian populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae), an annual aquatic that displays variation in selfing rates associated with the breakdown of tristyly to semi-homostyly.MethodsThirty-one Brazilian populations under uniform glasshouse conditions were compared to investigate genetic and environmental influences on flower size and stigma-anther separation (herkogamy), two traits that commonly vary in association with transitions to selfing. Within-plant variation in herkogamy was also examined and plants grown under contrasting environmental conditions were compared to examine to what extent this trait exhibits phenotypic plasticity.Key ResultsIn E. paniculata a reduction in herkogamy is the principal modification initiating the evolution of selfing. Significantly, reduced herkogamy was restricted to the mid-styled morph and occurred independently of flower size. Significant genetic variation for herkogamy was detected among populations and families, including genotypes exhibiting developmental instability of stamen position with bimodal distributions of herkogamy values. Cloned genets exposed to contrasting growth conditions demonstrated environmental control of herkogamy and genotypic differences in plasticity of this trait.ConclusionsThe ability to modify herkogamy independently of other floral traits, genetic variation in the environmental sensitivity of herkogamy, and the production of modified and unmodified flowers within some individuals, reveal the potential for dynamic control of the mating system in a species that commonly confronts heterogeneous aquatic environments.",Eichhornia paniculata; Expressivity; Flower morphology; Herkogamy; Outcrossing; Phenotypic plasticity; Pleiotropy; Population variation; Self-fertilization; Stigma-anther separation; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64949088312

In the first effort to characterize in detail the population genetic structure and dynamics of wild Medicago species in China, a population genetic study of two closely related Medicago species, M. lupulina and M. ruthenica, that are distinct in these traits, are reported. These species are valuable germplasm resources for the improvement of Medicago forage crops but are under threat of habitat destruction.MethodsThree hundred and twenty-eight individuals from 16 populations of the annual species, M. lupulina, and 447 individuals from 15 populations of the perennial species, M. ruthenica, were studied using 15 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. Conventional and Bayesian-clustering analyses were utilized to estimate population genetic structure, mating system and gene flow.Key ResultsGenetic diversity of M. lupulina (mean HE = 0·246) was lower than that of M. ruthenica (mean HE = 0·677). Populations of M. lupulina were more highly differentiated (FST = 0·535) than those of M. ruthenica (FST = 0·130). For M. lupulina, 55·5 of the genetic variation was partitioned among populations, whereas 76·6 of the variation existed within populations of M. ruthenica. Based on the genetic data, the selfing rates of M. lupulina and M. ruthenica were estimated at 95·8 and 29·5 , respectively. The genetic differentiation among populations of both species was positively correlated with geographical distance.ConclusionsThe mating system differentiation estimated from the genetic data is consistent with floral morphology and observed pollinator visitation. There was a much higher historical gene flow in M. ruthenica than in M. lupulina, despite more effective seed dispersal mechanisms in M. lupulina.

Positive connections between pollen traits and fitness have been found, but few studies of heritability have been conducted, and they have yielded conflicting results. To understand better the evolutionary significance of pollen competition and its potential role in sexual selection, the heritability of pollen tube-growth rate and the relationship between this trait and sporophytic offspring fitness were investigated in Collinsia heterophylla.MethodsBecause the question being asked was if female function benefited from obtaining genetically superior fathers by enhancing pollen competition, one-donor (per flower) crosses were used in order to exclude confounding effects of post-fertilization competition/allocation caused by multiple paternity. Each recipient plant was crossed with an average of five pollen donors. Pollen-tube growth rate and sporophytic traits were measured in both generations.Key ResultsPollen-tube growth rate in vitro differed among donors, and the differences were correlated with in vivo growth rate averaged over two to four maternal plants. Pollen-tube growth rate showed significant narrow-sense heritability and evolvability in a father-offspring regression. However, this pollen trait did not correlate significantly with sporophytic-offspring fitness.ConclusionsThese results suggest that pollen-tube growth rate can respond to selection via male function. The data presented here do not provide any support for the hypothesis that intense pollen competition enhances maternal plant fitness through increased paternity by higher-quality sporophytic fathers, although this advantage cannot be ruled out. These data are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that pollen competition is itself selectively advantageous, through both male and female function, by reducing the genetic load among successful gametophytic fathers (pollen), and reducing inbreeding depression associated with self-pollination in plants with mix-mating systems.",Collinsia heterophylla; Evolvability; Female fitness; Good genes; Heritability; Male fitness; Mixed-mating system; Plantaginaceae; Pollen competition; Sexual selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64949124675

A UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) dendrogram suggests that the population in Taiwan is genetically the most isolated, while among the mainland populations a trend of an east-west split is suggested. This finding is supported by the analysis of molecular variance.

Two species of Aletris occur in southern Florida: the yellow-flowered A. lutea and white-flowered A. bracteata. It is uncertain whether A. bracteata found in southern Florida is a distinct species or a variant of one of the other species found in the southeastern United States.

Plants with intermediate flower color dominated five of the six A. bracteata populations in southern Florida. These plants were morphologically most similar to A. bracteata from the Bahamas. Although A. bracteata and A. lutea differed in flowering phenology in southern Florida, flowering times in some populations overlapped in March, allowing for hybridization. Florida A. bracteata plants were self- compatible and autogamous, but seed set for open-pollinated plants was higher than for self-pollinated or autogamously-pollinated plants. We hypothesize that A. bracteata and A. lutea are distinct species but that some hybridization between them has occurred in southern Florida.",Aletris bracteata; Aletris lutea; Andros island; Bahamas; Big cypress national preserve; Everglades National Park; Flower color variation; Hybridization; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849091828

Previous simulation studies and field observations showed that co-existence at the landscape level of contrasting OSR varieties such as genetically modified (GM) and non-GM varieties require costly measures that are difficult to implement, such as isolation distances between OSR fields and stringent volunteer control in all fields and road margins. In the present study, two local strategies, non-GM buffer zones around GM fields and discarding the harvest of boundary plants of non-GM fields, were tested in a simulation study using the GENESYS model. This model, which was modified here to improve the prediction of volunteer reproduction and pollen dispersal, quantifies the effects of cropping system on gene flow in landscapes over the years. The evaluation of the improved model version with independent field observations showed that cross-pollination of fields was accurately predicted up to 50 m and systematically underestimated above that distance, though fields were still ranked correctly. A corrective factor should therefore be applied to predictions in case of low regional OSR and GM proportions (which result into large distances between fields). To study the effects of the two local strategies, simulations were carried out in four contrasted case studies, based on different landscapes, regional OSR and GM proportions, cropping systems and OSR varieties. In these situations, harvest discarding was needless when volunteers were well controlled because the GM impurity in non-GM harvests was well below the EU labelling thresholds; it was useless when OSR contained male-sterile plants or when the landscape was infested by volunteers because large parts of the fields had to be discarded to respect impurity thresholds, which is financially unacceptable. Buffer zones were useful if the non-GM varieties comprised male-sterile plants or if the non-GM fields were small, but only if volunteers were well controlled and harvest impurity was already close to the labelling threshold. Buffer zones appeared considerably more efficient in reducing harvest impurity than harvest discarding because they not only increase the distance between GM and non-GM fields but also diminish the proportion of GM pollen in the total pollen cloud over landscapes. Harvest discarding could possibly be interesting for isolated OSR crops surrounded by bare ground or small crops, an effect that was not tested here. The present study showed that efforts should be dedicated to characterizing and modelling of gene flow at the landscape level, as well as the collection of datasets for the evaluation of these models in many landscapes and configurations. Local measures tested here are insufficient for ensuring harvest purity. Therefore, future work should focus on finding additional measures are necessary to manage OSR volunteers which constitute the major risk factor for OSR harvest purity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this process can facilitate the production of this agriculturally valuable fruit crop. Over the years, it has been well established that tomato fruit set depends on successful pollination and fertilization, which trigger the fruit developmental programme through the activation of the auxin and gibberellin signalling pathways. However, the exact role of each of these two hormones is still poorly understood, probably because only few of the signalling components involved have been identified so far. Recent research on fruit set induced by hormone applications has led to new insights into hormone biosynthesis and signalling.

To better understand the role of CAM and epiphytism in the evolutionary expansion of tropical orchids, we sampled leaf carbon isotopic composition of 1,103 species native to Panama and Costa Rica, performed character state reconstruction and phylogenetic trait analysis of CAM and epiphytism, and related strong CAM, present in 10% of species surveyed, to climatic variables and the evolution of epiphytism in tropical regions. Altitude was the most important predictor of photosynthetic pathway when all environmental variables were taken into account, with CAM being most prevalent at low altitudes. By creating integrated orchid trees to reconstruct ancestral character states, we found that C 3 photosynthesis is the ancestral state and that CAM has evolved at least 10 independent times with several reversals. A large CAM radiation event within the Epidendroideae, the most species-rich epiphytic clade of any known plant group, is linked to a Tertiary species radiation that originated 65 million years ago. Our study shows that parallel evolution of CAM is present among subfamilies of orchids, and correlated divergence between photosynthetic pathways and epiphytism can be explained by the prevalence of CAM in low-elevation epiphytes and rapid speciation of high-elevation epiphytes in the Neotropics, contributing to the astounding diversity in the Orchidaceae. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249115785

The loss of S.I. has occurred many times independently, because it provides short-term advantages in situations where pollinators or mates are rare. The genus Capsella, which is closely related to Arabidopsis, contains a pair of closely related diploid species, the self-incompatible Capsella grandiflora and the self-compatible Capsella rubella. To elucidate the transition to selfing and its relationship to speciation of C. rubella, we have made use of comparative sequence information. Our analyses indicate that C. rubella separated from C. grandiflora recently (?30,000-50,000 years ago) and that breakdown of S.I. occurred at approximately the same time. Contrasting the nucleotide diversity patterns of the 2 species, we found that C. rubella has only 1 or 2 alleles at most loci, suggesting that it originated through an extreme population bottleneck. Our data are consistent with diploid speciation by a single, selfing individual, most likely living in Greece. The new species subsequently colonized the Mediterranean by Northern and Southern routes, at a time that also saw the spread of agriculture. The presence of phenotypic diversity within modern C. rubella suggests that this species will be an interesting model to understand divergence and adaptation, starting from very limited standing genetic variation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249092034

The observations were made between 2002 and 2006 on ruderal plots in Lublin, south eastern Poland. Both species formed inflorescences of the pseudantium type, known as cyathia. The number of inflorescences was 117.06 per shoot for E. cyparissias and 84.72 for E. virgultosa. The opening of spathe in the successive cyathia occurred almost simultaneously in both species, as early as at 6.00 h with the peak between 7.00 and 8.00 h. All cyathia of E. cyparissias are hermaphroditic. In the case of E. virgultosa, the bisexual cyathia on the shoots accounted for 58.3 %. Hermaphroditic cyathia are protogynous. Dichogamy in Euphorbia virgultosa is strengthened through the occurrence of exclusively male flowers in part of the cyathia. The mean number of anthers per cyathium in E. cyparissias and E. virgultosa, was 17.22 and 14.22, respectively. The small stamens of E. cyparissias yielded a mean of 0.38 mg of pollen per 100 anthers while the larger stamens of E. virgultosa yielded 0.51mg per 100 anthers. The weight of pollen per plant averaged 2.64 mg in E. virgultosa and 3.68 mg in E. cyparissias. Several hymenopteran species (Apis mellifera L. and solitary bees) visit E. cyparissias flowers. Additionally, Bombus spp. forages on E. virgultosa. Among the pollinators of both plants taxa, Diptera were present. Over the five-year period of observation, the density of species studied per square unit varied, but the plants renew each year. The associations with E. cyparissias and E. virgultosa are not subjected to rapid succession.

With the intensification of agriculture and consequently simplification of the structure of agricultural landscapes, this group has received more attention, as it contains key species to the structure of ecosystems such as ants and wasps that control phytophagous insects or bees pollinating the native vegetation. This study aimed at examining the communities of two taxa of Hymenoptera in an agricultural area using direct seeding in Rio Claro city, southeastern São Paulo, with Moericke traps, focusing on the abundance of parasitoids and richness of Formicidae. A total of 5308 parasitoid hymenopterans was collected, comprising 8 superfamilies and 22 families; Mymaridae was the most abundant. Among Formicidae, 6039 individuals, 38 morphospecies, 19 genera, 16 tribes, and 7 subfamilies were collected; Myrmicinae was the richest. The composition of these communities as a result of direct seeding and the importance of the use of Moericke traps in environmental monitoring are discussed.",Abundance; Formicidae; Moericke; Parasitoids; Richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62649093072

Three pollination types (1) in cages with honeybees, (2) hand pollination (in cages) and (3) in cages without honeybees were used in crosses between two male and three female parents in all possible combinations. The experiment factors; pollination types, male parents and female parents were designed in a split-split plot of randomized complete block. Seed set ratios were 98-99% for pollinations in cages with honeybees or by hand as artificial whereas this ratios was reduced to a level of 4-5% by pollination in cages without honeybees in the both experimental years. Pollination in cages without honeybees produced 93-94% less number of filled seeds per head compared with pollinations by hand and in cages with honeybees. In addition, pollinations in cages with honeybees and by hand resulted in higher 100 seed weight compared with pollination in cages without honeybees. Pollination in cages with honeybees and by hand increased seed yield per head by about 206 and 226%, respectively, compared with pollination in cages without honeybees.

Since 2000, 21 new pear cultivars were listed in the central register of cultivars. These cultivars originate in breeding programs, which have started in the 1960s. These cultivars should play an important role in the recovery of pear growing in the Czech Republic. According to a supply-demand analysis, there is a space in domestic and EU market for higher pear production. Based on the evaluation of important economic characters, the following cultivars were recommended for intensive pear orchard systems. Autumn cultivars: 'Karina' ('Max Red Bartlett' x 'Conference'), 'Manon' (open pollinated 'Beurré Bosc'), and 'Morava' ('Beurré Bosc' x 'Président Drouard'). Early winter cultivars: 'Vonka' (open pollinated 'Doyenné du Comice').

Flowering time was evaluated in two apricot progenies (F1 and BC1) from the cross between the apricot cultivar 'Orange Red'® (late flowering) and the Spanish cultivar 'Currot' (early flowering). In addition, a molecular characterization of the BC1 progeny was performed using nuclear simple sequence repeat markers. Results indicated the great effect of the juvenility (seedlings with vigorous long branches and a later flowering) in the evaluation of flowering time in apricot and the risk of evaluation of flowering time during the juvenility period. The presence of a major dominant gene for late flowering in apricot and the presence of deleterious genes have been discarded. In addition, chilling accumulation of the year greatly affects the variability of the flowering time in the progenies and can also affect the evaluation of the flowering time in the young apricot seedlings assayed. Finally, the effect of accidental pollinations and consanguinity was reduced in the evaluation of young seedlings.

Therefore, for breeding purposes, it is desirable to detect those compounds at a single seed level and establish the possible association of the content of those compounds with the embryo genotype and with the alleles transmitted by the pollen, i.e. male parent. We used hazelnut full-sib (FS) seed progenies from controlled pollination for efficiency testing of a multi-micro-method procedure comprising: a generalized low reagent-cost and low amount of extracting-tissue protocol for DNA purification and SSR seed genotyping, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection of analyte spectra for phenotyping metabolite content, and in vitro culture for clonal propagation of the embryo genotype. NMR was extremely efficient to measure the amount of multiple primary and secondary cotyledonary metabolites; SSR-PCR produced neat and polymorphic DNA fragments for the tested primer set and in vitro culture gave each embryo a probability of 0.85 to germinate and to be cloned in 3-4 ramets through seedling micro-cutting propagation.

Cherimoya shows protogynous dichogamy, a common characteristic in Annonaceae, where female and male structures do not mature simultaneously. Moreover, flowers of the same genotype usually open synchronously and, consequently, transfer of pollen between different flowers of the same genotype is difficult. This mechanism has been assumed to prevent self-fertilization and to encourage cross-pollination and has clear implications both from a plant breeding perspective and in an agronomic context. Inadequate pollination is one of the most important factors that limit commercial production of cherimoya resulting in low fruit set and in the production of misshapen fruits. This is due to the lack of overlap between the male and female stages and the expansion of the crop to areas outside its native range in absence of its natural pollinating insects. As a consequence, hand pollination is a common practice for commercial production. In spite of the implications of this isolating mechanism, its efficiency has not been previously evaluated. In this work, we evaluate stigmatic receptivity under the microscope and natural outcrossing rate using molecular markers to test the paternity of the seeds. The results obtained show that stigmas can still be receptive when the flowers pass to the male stage and that a surprisingly high proportion of the seeds produced are the result of self-fertilization. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of these results both in plant breeding and in an adequate crop handling.",Annona cherimola; Cherimoya; Dichogamy; Outcrossing rate; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350120056

Pi- as prefix indicate that cultivars were bred mainly for quality (Pi for Pillnitz) whereas Re- as prefix indicate the main aim resistance (Re for resistant). Although in apple breeding the protection of flowers with bags, before and after pollination with desired pollen is usual to prevent outbreeding, outbreeders occur. We were interested in verifying the expected parentage of the Pillnitz apple cultivars. Therefore a couple of microsatellites were applied to the Pillnitz cultivars and their parents. Since only three cultivars used as pollen donors for Re-cultivars were still available, only the maternal cultivar of the most Re-cultivars could be checked. The female parent for all Pi-cultivars tested and the male parent for 16 cultivars could be verified. 'Pimona' and 'Pikora' seems to descend from a cultivar different from the cultivar used as pollen donor. 'Pikkolo' descends from a cross of 'Clivia' pollinated with a pollen mixture of the three cultivars 'Auralia', 'Kurzcox', and 'Undine'.

Only a very small fraction of the flowers produced at anthesis in an avocado tree (less than 1%) are able to set fruits and the production is very dependent of the environmental conditions. Consequently, knowledge of avocado reproductive biology is important to increase yield and to design appropriate breeding programs in this species. Avocado is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree that shows protogynous dichogamy. Although the flowers are bisexual, each flower opens twice: first functionally as female (stigmas are receptive), then the flower closes and reopens the next day functionally as male (dehiscence of anthers). The different avocado cultivars are classified by their floral behaviour in two groups: A and B. In type A cultivars, the flowers open in the morning as females and in the afternoon of the following day as males whereas in type B cultivars, the flowers open in the afternoon as females and the following morning as males. The main objective of this work was to determine the changes in the effective pollination period (EPP) due to environmental factors, mainly temperature and relative humidity. Thus, we analyzed the progamic phase, from pollination to fertilization under the environmental conditions of Southern Spain: pollen deposition on the stigmas, pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and pollen tube penetration into the ovule. The response of pollen germination to temperature and humidity has also been evaluated for different genotypes both in vivo and in vitro. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of the environmental conditions on reproductive success and fruit set in avocado to elucidate the limiting factors in production of this species and to design appropriate crosses.",Hass; Pollen germination; Relative humidity; Stigmatic receptivity; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350087802

However, male flowers produced larger anthers, larger pollen grains and smaller ovaries than perfect flowers. Observations on pollinators indicated that two major pollinators (Xylocopa valga Gerst and Proxylocopa sinensis Wu) did not discriminate between flower morphs and that they transferred pollen grains a similar distance. However, there were more seeds per fruit following hand pollination with pollen from male flowers than from perfect flowers. Individuals of C. spinosa with a larger floral display (i.e. bearing more flowers) received more pollen grains on the stigma of perfect flowers. Female reproductive success probably is not limited by pollen. These results indicate that male flowers of C. spinosa save resources for female function and that they primarily serve to attract pollinators as pollen donors. © 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Andromonoecy; Capparis spinosa; Pollen donor; Pollinator attractors; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149130988

Over the last half a century there has only been negligible adoption of new maize varieties that have been centrally developed and then released for cultivation in this complex environment. Acquisition of local knowledge and participation of farmers in participatory varietal selection (PVS) and participatory plant breeding (PPB) enabled rapid identification and development of germplasm adapted to the farming system with significantly higher yield than extant varieties. Two unreleased open-pollinated varieties (Population-22 and BA-93-2126#2 and two released (Manakamana-1 and Arun-1), and four newly bred composite varieties by PPB, all with attributes conforming to farmers' articulated requirements, were evaluated in on-station and on-farm participatory trials that used a Mother and Baby design. Population-22, not previously released because it was later maturing than local varieties, was preferred by farmers over both local and released varieties. It had higher grain yield (21-52% more than local varieties) and several other traits that were compatible with the agricultural system of the middle hills, revealing that farmers were prepared to trade-off later maturity against other traits. This led to the release of Population-22 as Manakamana-3 in 2002. PPB involved mass selection by farmers from crossing various combinations of local and new white- and yellow-grained varieties. The variety most preferred by farmers, PM-7, was developed from crossing a new yellow-grained variety with local and new white-grained varieties and extracting a white-grained population from the segregating progeny after two generations. Overall, it was demonstrated that local knowledge acquisition and PVS led to farmers selecting a variety that had previously escaped identification, while through PPB farmers participated in developing new varieties with specific adaptation to the target area. Involving the client farmers in the breeding and selection process broke an impasse in finding new varieties that combined higher yield in marginal hill environments with the required compatibility with the farming system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

One reason is that both plants and pollinators are active for only a part of the year, and so a plant species flowering in spring cannot interact with a pollinator species that is active only in autumn. In this paper we build a stochastic model to simulate the plant-pollinator interaction network, taking into account the duration of activity of each species. To build the model we used an empirical plant-pollinator network from a Mediterranean scrub community surveyed over four years. In our simulated annual cycle we know which plant and pollinator species are active, and thus available to interact. We can obtain simulated plant-pollinator interaction networks with properties similar to the real ones in two different ways: (i) by assuming that the frequency distribution of both plant and pollinator duration of activity follow an exponential function, and that interaction among temporally coexisting species are totally random, and (ii) by assuming more realistic frequency distributions (exponential for pollinators, lognormal for plants) and that the interaction among coexisting species is occurring on a per capita basis. In the latter case we assume that there is a positive relationship between abundance and duration of activity. In our model the starting date of the species activity had little influence on the network structure.

In OSR, as for most crops, impurity rates are expected to depend on the spatial distribution of crops over the landscape. However, in contrast to other well-studied crops such as maize, OSR crops generate seed banks in European agro-ecosystems. Gene flow is thus a spatio-temporal process which depends on cropping systems. We therefore aimed at identifying spatial variables that have an effect on regional or local harvest impurities, taking account of the time since the introduction of OSR crops in the regions and of cropping system. Gene flow was simulated over 36 field patterns cultivated with either 15% or 30% of OSR fields, among which 10% or 50% were GM, for three contrasted cropping systems, with the GeneSys software already used for EU co-existence studies. Through regression analyses, we determined spatial and agronomic factors that most affected harvest impurity rates of non-GM OSR after one or seven years of OSR cultivation. The cropping system was the main factor explaining regional harvest impurity rates. Its importance increased after six years of OSR cultivation. For a given cropping system, the regional impurity rate after one year increased linearly with the current proportion of GM crop. In contrast, impurity rates after six years largely depended on the proportions of OSR crop (GM or not) in the two preceding years. During the first year of OSR cultivation, local impurity rates were mostly explained by the distance to the closest GM field. After six years, these rates were mostly explained by the density of GM volunteers in the analysed field and, to a lesser degree, to that of volunteers in neighbour non-OSR fields. Cropping systems were most important in determining impurity rates and the way impurity rates related to regional or local factors. Determination of isolation distances to ensure harvest purity should thus consider past history of OSR cultivation in the area and, in particular, how current or future cropping systems will manage volunteers. Regression quantiles were fitted to the simulated data to determine regional rules (i.e. the maximum regional area of GM OSR and isolation distances between GM and non-GM crops) as a function of the risk accepted by the decision-maker (i.e. the % of situations exceeding harvest impurity thresholds), the cropping system and the volunteer infestation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the possible flow of genes to wild-type or neighboring plant species raises ecological and commercial concerns, although herbicide-tolerant GM Zoysia grass does not appear to pose a significant risk. One efficient way to prevent transgene escape in GM plants is to control fertility. Thus, we attempted to generate GM Zoysia mutants with defects in the development of reproductive organs, but that can be vegetatively propagated. To induce mutation, a range of ?-rays from 10 to 50 Gy, initially determined to be the optimal dose for inducing mutation, was used to irradiate GM Zoysia during the pollination stage. Notably, nine (4%) lines displayed defects in the floral transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase, while all nonirradiated GM Zoysia grasses developed normally. Under greenhouse conditions (natural light and temperature), these GM Zoysia lines have been vegetatively propagated for four years without forming reproductive structures. This technology could also be applied in other GM plants being cultivated through vegetative propagation, such as creeping bent grass.",Gamma rays; Herbicide-tolerant; Transgene escape; Zoysia japonica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62249117110

Even though not all Vaccinium crops require cross pollination, a biotic agent, in particular bees, move pollen from flower to flower. Vaccinium flowers are adapted to vibratile pollination (AKA 'buzz' pollination), a specialized foraging behaviour by many but not all bees. Bumble bees and many other indigenous bees forage for pollen in this manner, while honey bees do not. Pollen foraging bees have been shown to be more effective pollinators than those collecting only nectar. A diverse group of indigenous bees visit Vaccinium and their importance to fruit production is only just beginning to be recognized. Areas surrounding fields provide important habitat to pollinators and the more diverse the landscape, the more resilient the resident pollinator population is. Rarely are indigenous bees abundant enough to pollinate large, commercial plantings, thus, managed bees are brought into fields. While honey bees have been the mainstay of commercial pollination service, increasingly, managed bumble bees and alfalfa leafcutting bees are being used in blueberry and cranberry in North America. Enhancement of pollination by managed and indigenous bee pollinators can be achieved through the incorporation of 'bee-friendly' practices into crop management plans.",Alfalfa leafcutting bees; Bee habitat; Bumble bees; Honey bees; Indigenous bees; Pollination requirements,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350066470

In Oregon, highbush blueberry producers typically stock honey bee hives but honey bees do not perform efficiently during the cool weather conditions that prevail during bloom. Native bees, especially bumble bees, are considered to be better pollinators of blueberries as they forage in colder temperatures, and they remove blueberry pollen efficiently through buzz pollination. The Pacific Northwest has a rich diversity of native bees, but there is little information on their presence in blueberry growing regions during bloom. Our objective was to determine the diversity and abundance of native bees in highbush blueberry fields in Oregon. Weekly surveys were conducted over four weeks of bloom in five blueberry fields in the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. We collected 30 native bee species belonging to five families in 11 genera. Six species of bumble bees were collected, of which Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski was collected in the greatest abundance. Other native bees comprised 79% of the captured bees. In the analysis of variance, the interaction of sites and weeks significantly influenced native bee captures. The five sites differed in production practices, location and adjacent habitats but there was 48% to 66% similarity in total native bees captured based on the modified Sorenson's Coefficient. However, when bumble bees were compared, one site was observed to have a significantly higher abundance compared with the other four sites. No location or production specific factor accounting for the difference was identified. Overall, the study indicated a rich native bee fauna in Oregon during blueberry bloom. However with the projected increases in blueberry production in future years, there is a need to conserve existing populations, and adopt management strategies that encourage build-up of native bee fauna in blueberry fields, and in surrounding landscapes.",Bumble bees; Highbush blueberries; Pollination; Vaccinium corymbosum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350057424

However, Florida's Vaccinium species, and even the V. darrowii genetic pool, have not been extensively studied as possible sources of genetic variation.

Our objectives were to conduct a census of bumble bees during blueberry bloom, determine which species forage on blueberry flowers, and estimate their blossom visitation rate. Blue vane traps used for the census study captured 270 bumble bees belonging to 7 species.

Bombus vosnesenskii was the dominant species comprising 52.5% of the 225 bumble bees observed foraging on blueberry blossoms. We recorded an average of 0.11 bumble bees per bush per 2 min of observation or 150 per ha per minute. Over 80% of bumble bees observed were queens, which is beneficial for blueberry pollination as queens are more efficient as pollinators than workers. Observations on flower visitations indicated that queens spent an average of 4 seconds per flower. Using bumble bee abundance, and floral visitation rates, we conservatively estimated that over 11.5 million flowers were visited during blueberry bloom. The abundance of native bumble bees and the high proportion of queens foraging on blueberries could account for the high yield (> 10 ton /acre) recorded by the producer from the study site though other native bees and honey bees could also have played a role.",Bombus vosnesenskii; Highbush blueberries; Pollination; Vaccinium corymbosum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350055161

Subsequent surveys indicated BlScV to be well established within the Lower Fraser Valley, the major blueberry producing region of the province. A BlScV Working Group was formed in 2001 to prioritize and coordinate research, extension and management activities. Since 2001, a free DAS-ELISA-based BlScV diagnostic service was made available to growers. This provided information on the distribution and spread of the virus. BlScV is transmitted non-persistently by the colonizing aphid on blueberry, Ericaphis fimbriata. Virus-vector transmission studies showed that peak transmission is most likely to occur from mid-June to mid-July, which coincides with highest aphid populations. Aphids could be most effectively managed with insecticides applied in early spring, after egg hatch, but before development of winged aphids. Insecticide screening trials demonstrated that application of pymetrozine in early spring can effectively control aphids without disrupting populations of beneficial and pollinating insects. Several species of migrant aphids were also shown to be capable of transmitting BlScV under laboratory conditions. Epidemiological studies determined that the rate of virus spread was approximately 4% per year in an unmanaged, heavily infected field. In a similar field, with a management program of aphid control and infected-plant removal, spread was reduced to less than 2% per year. Based on these findings, a BlScV management program, including a protocol for nursery stock production, field monitoring, virus testing, removal of infected plants and aphid management, was developed and extended to the blueberry industry.",Aphids; Blueberry scorch virus; Ericaphis fimbriata; Pymetrozine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350066484

This is largely because of the current fashion among the gardening public for functional plants that produce fruit as well as having a decorative appearance. The ornamental market, although small in comparison with other markets, is becoming more important and warrants particular consideration for the selection of new cultivars. Two cultivars bred by HortResearch, 'Hortblue Onyx' and 'Hortblue Petite', have been evaluated and released as ornamentals over the past eight years. Trials have been conducted in New Zealand and Germany. 'Hortblue Onyx' is a selection from an open pollinated population from a seedling of Vaccinium simulatum Small while 'Hortblue Petite' was selected from open pollinated seedlings of V. corymbosum L.

Vaccinium species are hosts for two pathogens that occur in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and impact collection management. One is the fungus Phytophthora ramorum and the other is Blueberry shock virus (BlShV). Phytophthora ramorum is a devastating pathogen of certain oak species and has a very broad host range with varying symptoms including foliar blight in some Vaccinium species. Vaccinium germplasm must be inspected and certified to be free of this pathogen to protect the U.S. nursery industry and native flora. The pollen-borne BlShV has made it necessary to move the primary Vaccinium clonal collection from a field planting to a protected potted collection. More than 600 clonal accessions are maintained in greenhouses or screenhouses, protected from pollinators and other virus vectors. These clonal accessions represent more than 60 unique Vaccinium taxa from around the world and include 171 cranberry, 46 lingonberry, 15 lowbush blueberry, and 182 highbush and/or rabbiteye blueberry genotypes. Migration to a protected container collection required the development of a management strategy to maintain plants in a vigorous condition that would provide high quality vegetative growth suitable for propagation. However, tree bark in container growth media is a potential source of P. ramorum dissemination. Trials were conducted to select a bark-free medium with good fertility and porosity that would be stable for an expected 8-10 year lifespan of a potted blueberry plant. A blend of volcanic pumice (50%), un-milled, coarse, sphagnum peat moss (40%), and sandy loam (10%) was selected. A 3-5 cm deep pumice top-dress (collar) was added to the surface of each pot to create a semisterile, dry, inorganic surface that prevents weed, moss, and fungus gnat growth. This top-dress combined with a stable, bark-free potting medium creates a growing system that greatly reduces water use, nutrient leaching, salt build-up, and moisture stress. Woody Vaccinium clones are hard-pruned in late winter to remove all flower buds and six to eight upright shoots are selected and allowed to grow. These shoots provide cuttings that are distributed by the genebank for research or propagation.",Blueberry shock ilarvirus; Conservation; Germplasm; Growing medium; Phytophthora ramorum; Preservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350066482

For this reason, we have been investigating a proper method to force blueberries into producing mature fruit before the rainy season. Many southern highbush cultivars were grown under heating culture, and the flowering and harvesting time, percentage of harvest and yield, and fruit quality parameters were determined. The potted plants were transferred from outdoors into a plastic house at the beginning of February in 2006 and 2007. Temperature was maintained between 10° C and 35° C with heating until the middle of May in both years. Bee pollination, watering, fertilizing were performed using conventional methods. Although some differences occurred from year to year, flowering and harvesting time were advanced 30-40 days under heating culture, compared to the open field culture. The ripening and harvesting time of all cultivars were almost completed before the rainy season began, regardless of the differences of plant age and pot soil. Fruit size, juice pH, soluble solid content, citric acid content and soluble solid-acid ratio differed among the cultivars. We found that these characteristics also varied with year, plant age and pot soil. From the results we conclude that heating culture of southern highbush blueberry is effective in forcing blueberries plants to produce mature fruit before the rainy season begins in Japan.

This is a typical ""southern"" plant family found on all the southern continents as well as New Zealand. The Restionaceae comprises 55 genera and approximately 490 species, of which 19 genera and some 330 species are found in the Western Cape of South Africa. Restios are one of the defining families of fynbos, the unique and threatened shrubland vegetation occurring in a small belt of the Western Cape. Their natural habitat is coastal and mountainous areas with winter rainfall and a Mediterranean climate. Like a number of other fynbos species, Restios may require or benefit from smoke treatment for seed germination. The Restios are perennial, evergreen plants, ranging from 10 cm to 3 m in height; the plants have erect photosynthetic stems with leaves reduced to leaf sheaths. The family is dioecious and is wind pollinated. Some Restios have economic importance in South Africa as a traditional thatching material, and for decades certain species have been exported as cut-greens. The full potential of Restionaceae as ornamental plants is however only just beginning to be exploited. There is a growing trend towards using grasses and grass-like plants for landscaping as well as in interior decorating, and Restionaceae with its many highly ornamental species will be very suitable for exploiting this opportunity. Restios may be grown as potted plants, as patio plants, as garden plants and for cut foliage. Some species are moderately frost hardy and are becoming increasingly popular in e.g. the southern UK. At New Plant Nursery we have been propagating and growing Restios for more than two decades. We constantly strive to develop new species for the local market and, through our new export venture Fair Plant Nursery, for the export market.

Production of hybrid seeds in bitter gourd is highly expensive because it is done mainly through hand pollination. But utilization of a gynoecious line would be more economical and easier method. Since gynoecious parent has only female flowers, the open pollinated seeds it produces will be F1 hybrid. It will reduce the cost of male flower pinching and hand pollination. Two gynoecious lines, DBGY-201 and DBGY-202 were crossed with two monoecious cultivars, ""Pusa Do Mausami"" and ""Pusa Vishesh"" and their F2 populations were observed to determine the inheritance pattern of gynoecious sex form. Another experiment was conducted to determine magnitude of heterosis by utilizing nine inbred lines including one gynoecious line, DBGY-201 in diallel (without reciprocal) mating system. All the gynoecious hybrids showed significant heterosis in a desirable direction for traits like sex ratio (male:female), days to first picking, number of fruits per plant, yield per plant, and vine length.

The pollination systems of two African Eucomis species (E. autumnalis and E. comosa) were investigated and a test was made of the importance of scent and visual cues as floral attractants.  Methods and Key Results: Visitor observations showed that E. autumnalis and E. comosa are visited primarily by pompilid wasps belonging to the genus Hemipepsis. These wasps carry considerably more Eucomis pollen and are more active on flowers than other visiting insects. Furthermore, experiments involving virgin flowers showed that these insects are capable of depositing pollen on the stigmas of E. autumnalis, and, in the case of E. comosa, pollen deposited during a single visit is sufficient to result in seed set. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that both species are genetically self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinators for seed set. Choice experiments conducted in the field and laboratory with E. autumnalis demonstrated that pompilid wasps are attracted to flowers primarily by scent and not visual cues. Measurement of spectral reflectance by flower petals showed that flowers are cryptically coloured and are similar to the background vegetation. Analysis of headspace scent samples using coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that E. autumnalis and E. comosa scents are dominated by aromatic and monoterpene compounds. One hundred and four volatile compounds were identified in the floral scent of E. autumnalis and 83 in the floral scent of E. comosa, of which 57 were common to the scents of both species.  Conclusions: This study showed that E. autumnalis and E. comosa are specialized for pollination by pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis and achieve specialization through cryptic colouring and the use of scent as a selective floral attractant. © The Author 2008.

We tested this idea of indirect interactions on a small spatial and temporal scale in a field study in Mauritius, where the invasive strawberry guava, Psidium cattleianum, provides additional floral resources for insect pollinators. We predicted that the presence of flowering guava would indirectly and negatively affect the reproductive success of the endemic plant Bertiera zaluzania, which has similar flowers, by diverting shared pollinators. We removed P. cattleianum flowers within a 5-m radius from around half the B. zaluzania target plants (treatment) and left P. cattleianum flowers intact around the other half (control). By far, the most abundant and shared pollinator was the introduced honey bee, Apis mellifera, but its visitation rates to treatment and control plants were similar. Likewise, fruit and seed set and fruit size and weight of B. zaluzania were not influenced by the presence of P. cattleianum flowers. Although other studies have shown small-scale effects of alien plant species on neighbouring natives, we found no evidence for such negative indirect interactions in our system. The dominance of introduced, established A. mellifera indicates their replacement of native insect flower visitors and their function as pollinators of native plant species. However, the pollination effectiveness of A. mellifera in comparison to native pollinators is unknown. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Apis mellifera; Bertiera zaluzania; Indirect interaction; Invasive plant; Plant reproductive success; Psidium cattleianum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449264581

In order to assess the extent to which floral characters reflect selection by the most important pollinators we evaluated pollination syndromes in a florally diverse plant group, the tribe Gesnerieae, a monophyletic plant radiation from the Antillean islands. 2. The study species include representatives of three groups of floral phenotypes, two of which chiefly correspond to ornithophilous and chiropterophilous syndromes. The third group includes subcampanulate flowers (characterized by a corolla constriction above the nectar chamber) with combinations of traits not fitting classic pollination syndromes. 3. Pollination systems were characterized for 19 Gesnerieae species in five Antillean islands between 2003 and 2007 and supplemented with observations of four Gesneriaceae species from Costa Rica. Pollinator visitation and frequency of contact with anthers or stigmas were used to calculate an index of pollinator importance. Eleven floral traits including morphology, phenology and rewards were used to assess clustering patterns in phenotype space. 4. Multidimensional scaling analysis of floral traits resulted in two clusters comprising: (i) tubular, red to yellow-flowered species with diurnal anthesis, (ii) bell-shaped-flowered species; two groups of floral phenotypes were evident within the latter cluster, campanulate nocturnal and subcampanulate flowers. Correlations between pollinator importance values and floral axes revealed strong associations with the expected pollinators, hummingbirds for tubular flowers, and bats for campanulate flowers; subcampanulate-flowered species had generalized pollination systems including bats, hummingbirds and insects. Discriminant analysis of the multivariate set of floral traits correctly classified 19 out of 23 species into the predicted pollination categories. 5. Synthesis. This study provides support for classic hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes, demonstrating the importance of pollinator-mediated selection in the floral diversification of Antillean Gesnerieae. However, there was evidence for generalized pollination systems in species characterized by a unique morphological trait (corolla constriction), but with variable combinations of other floral traits. These findings suggests that floral phenotypes might also evolve under selection by various functional groups of pollinators, and underscores the importance of considering the presence and effectiveness of all floral visitors in pollination studies. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Antilles; Bat pollination; Costa Rica; Generalization; Gesneriaceae; Hummingbird pollination; Islands; Pollination syndromes; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60049099611

Floral dimensions, nectar characters, and color spectra combined in the hybrids in a largely linear fashion, consistent with an interpretation of net additive gene expression. In other words, the changes from one pollination syndrome to another appeared to be quantitative. There were some deviations from linearity, but not so much as to obscure the linear effect. Generally, backcrosses were not more variable than F1 hybrids or pure parents. Hummingbirds preferred P. centranthifolius over P. spectabilis. The strength of this preference varied by year, and the birds did not respond to hybrids in a strictly linear fashion.

Bag. X7, Claremont 7735, South Africa","Field studies of 13 of the estimated 17 species of the southern African geophytic genus Ferraria (Iridaceae: Iridoideae) identified four distinct pollination systems. Ferraria flowers are radially symmetric and cupped with a large, mostly pale or dull-colored perianth. Perigonal nectaries secrete hexose dominant (fructose and glucose) nectar. Most species are pollinated by Diptera of four families, apparently attracted by strong floral odors, mostly putrid or fermenting, but sometimes apparently sweet, and a large perianth mottled and edged with dark color. Concentrated sugary secretions are produced on the tepal claws that form a shallow floral cup. In contrast, flowers of F. ferrariola have a deep, narrow floral cup, a pale blue or yellow perianth, and a spicy scent and are pollinated by bees in the family Apidae, rewarded by nectar of moderate sugar concentration. Ferraria divaricata and F. variabilis have dull-colored, darkly speckled or streaked perianths and produce ample, highly dilute nectar pooled at the base of the floral cup and are pollinated by eumenid and masarine wasps (Vespidae). Lastly, F. uncinata has flowers with a narrow floral cup and dull violet tepals with brown margins. They are visited only by meloid and melyrid beetles. All pollen transfers from the anther of a Ferraria flower to an insect's body are passive, regardless of pollinator. Pollen load analyses suggests that all pollinators show a high degree of faithfulness to Ferraria flowers. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Coleoptera; Diptera; Ferraria; Hymenoptera; Pollination; Sapromyiophily; Sub-Saharan Africa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61349179437

However, most studies to date have been on wind- or insect-pollinated species. Here, we assigned paternity to quantify effective pollen dispersal over 9 years of mating, contrasted this to seed dispersal and examined their effects on fine-scale spatial genetic structure, within the bird-pollinated shrub Banksia hookeriana (Proteaceae). We used 163 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to assess genetic structure and pollen dispersal in a spatially discrete population of 112 plants covering 0.56 ha. Spatial autocorrelation analysis detected spatial genetic structure in the smallest distance class of 0-5 m (r=0.025), with no significant structure beyond 8 m. Experimentally quantified seed-dispersal distances for 337 seedlings showed a leptokurtic distribution around a median of 5 m, reaching a distance of 36 m. In marked contrast, patterns of pollen dispersal for 274 seeds departed strikingly from typical near-neighbour pollination, with a distribution largely corresponding to the spatial distribution of plants. We found very high multiple paternity, very low correlated paternity and an equal probability of siring for the 50 closest potential mates. Extensive pollen carryover was demonstrated by multiple siring in 83 of 86 (96.5%) two-seeded fruits. Highly mobile nectar-feeding birds facilitate this promiscuity through observed movements that were effectively random. As the incidence of bird-pollination is markedly greater in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region than elsewhere, our results have broad and novel significance for the evolution and conservation for many species in Gondwanan lineages. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",AFLP; Bird pollination; Paternity; Pollen dispersal; Seed dispersal; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60649096862

Nevertheless, their effect on fruit set can be indirectly positive if the nectar removal causes an incremental increase in the frequency of legitimate flower visits of effective pollinators, especially in obligate outcrossers. We studied pollination and the effect of nectar robbers on the reproductive fitness of Jacaranda rugosa, an endemic shrub of the National Park of Catimbau, in the Caatinga of Pernambuco, Brazil. Xenogamous J. rugosa flowers continuously produced nectar during the day at a rate of 1 ?l·h -1. Female and male Euglossa melanotricha were the main pollinators. Early morning flower visits substantially contributed to fruit set because stigmas with open lobes were almost absent in the afternoon. Ninety-nine per cent of the flowers showed damage caused by nectar robbers. Artificial addition of sugar water prolonged the duration of flower visits of legitimate flower visitors. Removal of nectar, simulating the impact of nectar robbers, resulted in shorter flower visits of euglossine bees. While flower visits of nectar-robbing carpenter bees (Xylocopa frontalis, X. grisescens, X. ordinaria) produced only a longitudinal slit in the corolla tube in the region of the nectar chamber, worker bees of Trigona spinipes damaged the gynoecium in 92% of the flowers.

The flowers and fruits are often visited by the invasive ant Technomyrmex albipes, which forages on the nectar and fruit pulp, and tends honeydew-producing mealybugs on the fruits. Here, we experimentally explore how the presence of this alien ant species influences geckos foraging at flowers and fruits of R. simplex by removing and excluding ants from flowers and fruits. Gecko visitation rates to ant-free control flowers and fruits, and flowers and fruits where ants had been removed and excluded, were higher than those to ant-infested flowers and fruits. The resulting seed set of ant-infested flowers was greatly reduced, compared to ant-free control flowers. Similarly, for fruits with ants, very few seeds were likely to be ingested and dispersed by the geckos. Thus, T. albipes monopolizes flowers and fruits of R. simplex, and prevents access of pollinating and seed-dispersing P. cepediana geckos by aggressive interference competition. For a critically endangered plant like R. simplex, this double-disruption of two vital mutualistic interactions is of urgent conservation concern. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Conservation; Indian Ocean; Introduced species; Island; Phelsuma cepediana; Plant-animal interactions; Rousseaceae; Technomyrmex albipes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61549132833

Invasive plants have various negative effects on natives through competition; however, relatively little is known about competition for pollination. The relationship between Japanese native dandelions (Taraxacum spp.) and invasive congeners may be a typical case of such an interaction. For example, native dandelions are being replaced by invasive congeners, especially in urban and suburban areas of Japan. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesized that when natives are mixed with attractive invasives, natives may suffer from reduced seed set because invasives deprive natives of pollinators or because pollinators frequently move between species, resulting in interspecific pollen transfer. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of the invasive dandelion T. officinale on the pollination and seed set of the native T. japonicum using artificial arrays of monospecific and mixed-species plots as well as natural populations. Taraxacum officinale attracted more pollinator visits, perhaps because it produced more nectar than T. japonicum. The number of pollinator visits to T. japonicum was reduced when the congeners were grown together, and pollinators moved frequently between the two species. The proportion of seed set for T. japonicum was reduced in the presence of T. officinale in both artificial arrays and natural populations. These results support our hypothesis that interspecific competition for pollination plays an important role in the recent replacement of native dandelions by invasive congeners in Japan. Because invasive dandelions are apomicts, negative effects are incurred only by sexual natives. Thus, this system can be recognized as a rare case of interspecific interaction through pollination. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Dandelion Wars; Exploitation competition; Interference competition; Pollinator; Taraxacum japonicum; Taraxacum officinale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60449109254

The scent attracts bee pollinators (Paratetrapedia fervida), which collect floral oils produced by elaiophores on the lip apex and column base. The secretory tissue of the elaiophore on the lip apex consists of both palisade-like epidermal cells and conspicuously elongated unicellular trichomes. From an anatomical point of view, this elaiophore differs in structure from those known in angiosperms to date. The elaiophore on the column base is exclusively composed of short unicellular trichomes. In addition, there is an elaiophore comprising a papillate epidermis on the internal surface of the lip. The elaiophores produce a heterogeneous secretion, composed of fatty acids and mucilage. The elaiophore on the internal surface of the lip produces oil in non-collectible amounts, but it is enough to maintain the interest of the bees, guiding them to the elaiophore on the column base, a necessary step in pollination. The former elaiophore is here identified as an oil guide and it plays an essential role in ensuring pollination. The presence of three types of elaiophores on the flowers of this species of Orchidaceae is peculiar and noteworthy. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.",Anatomy; Column; Floral glands; Labellum; Lip; Oil guide; Secretion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62549163351

Wild populations still occur in isolated patches in their natural habitats; however, much of today's commercial product comes from cultivated sources. There is no information on domestication-related traits of this species; the main objective of this study was to compare wild and cultivated populations of cardamom in terms of vegetative and reproductive features in order to identify domestication syndromes and to examine whether the two populations have developed reproductive barriers.  Methods: Two wild populations and five cultivated plantations were used for the present study. Vegetative and floral traits, flowering phenology, pollination biology and breeding systems of wild and cultivated populations were compared. Effective pollinators amongst floral visitors were identified by confirming pollen transfer as well as by fruit set following their visit to virgin flowers. Manual pollinations were carried out in order to study the breeding systems of the two populations and reproductive barriers, if any, between them.  Key Results: Several productive traits including the number of branches, number of inflorescences, and total number of flowers per clump, number of flowers that open each day, the duration of flowering, the length of the flower and the amount of nectar per flower are significantly greater in cultivated cardamom. The principal pollinators in wild cardamom are solitary bees, Megachile sp. and two species of Amegilla, whereas those in cultivated cardamom are the social bees Apis dorsata, A. cerana and Trigona iridipennis. Both the wild and cultivated populations are self-compatible and there are no reproductive barriers between the two populations.  Conclusions: Domestication in cardamom has brought about significant changes in vegetative and reproductive traits and a shift in effective pollinators from native solitary bees to social bees. The shift in pollinators seems to be due to the availability of a large number of flowers for prolonged periods in cultivated cardamom that can attract and sustain social bees, rather than due to co-evolution of the flower and the pollinator. © The Author 2009.

Additionally, application of Euphorbia pollen to Viola stigmas prior to conspe-cific pollen reduced seed set. However, natural receipt of Euphorbia and other heterospecific pollen was not associated with decreased fruit or seed set. In the field, fruit set was higher for Viola in sites with Euphorbia despite increased Euphorbia pollen receipt, and seed set did not vary with the presence of Euphorbia. However, there was no significant interaction between the presence of Euphorbia and flower type (cleistogamous or chasmogamous), suggesting that increased fruit set near Euphorbia is unrelated to pollination.

We found that Orii's flying-fox potentially pollinated seven native plant species. Its feeding behavior and plant morphological traits suggested that this species is an important pollinator of Schima wallichii liukiuensis and Mucuna macrocarpa. The flying-fox also dispersed the seeds of 20 native plant species. The seeds of all plants eaten by the flying-fox were usually dropped beneath the parent tree, although large fruits of four plant species were occasionally brought to the feeding roosts in the mouth, with the maximum dispersal distance-for Terminalia catappa-estimated to be 126 m. Small seeds of 11 species (mostly Ficus species) were dispersed around other trees, during the subsequent feeding session, through the digestive tracts, with the mean dispersal distance for ingested seeds estimated at 150 ± 230.3 m (±SD); the maximum dispersal distance was 1833 m. A comparison of the seed dispersal of available fruits according to the size of flying-foxes and other frugivores suggested that the seed dispersal of eight plant species producing large fruits mostly depended on Orii's flying-fox. On Okinawa-jima Island, the Orii's flying-fox plays an important role as a pollinator of two native plants and as a long-distance seed disperser of Ficus species, and it functions as a limited agent of seed dispersal for plants producing large fruits on Okinawa-jima Island. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Okinawa-jima Island; Pollination; Pteropus dasymallus; Ryukyu Archipelago; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349150044

Given their highly female-biased sex ratios and high relatedness between competing males, this phenomenon is surprising. Using a comparative approach, we found a significant association between high adult sex ratios (male:female), fighting and dispersal. We conclude that a relatively high proportion of males could have led to the evolution of fighting and to excess males that avoid kin conflict through dispersal. These wasps respond to increased competition between relatives by altering the scale at which they compete, but also by competing more intensely. In support of the new generation of kin selection models, we found that relatedness of competing males has no effect on the likelihood of fighting. Even so, selection at a higher hierarchical level has selected for dispersal and hence a larger scale at which competition occurs. We found that although the sex ratio gives a rough indication of the mating system it fails to be accurate at a finer scale. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Agaonidae; dispersal; fighting; local mate competition; mating system; pollinator wasp; relatedness; sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849097065

Salt stress decreased plant height, the length and area of the flag leaf, fresh and dry weights of the shoot, roots, and flag leaf, and water content. On the background of salinity, PBZ treatment further suppressed plant height. Although plants growth was suppressed in PBZ-treated plants, PBZ treatment moderated the negative effect of salinity on some growth parameters. Under PBZ treatments, plants tissues accumulated more watersoluble carbohydrates and reducing sugars than control plants, with the exception of water-soluble carbohydrates in the roots. The Na+ content in roots significantly (p ?0.05) increased at 150 and 225 mM NaCl, but PBZ treatment moderated the harmful effect of the highest levels of salinity. Salinity with or without PBZ treatment improved the K+, P, and N contents in plants. It is reasonably to suggest that the protection and increasing salt tolerance caused by PBZ was due to the mechanism nearly similar to the salt-tolerant cultivar physiological systems. These observations suggest that PBZ treatment has the potential to increase salt tolerance with a limiting damage caused by salt stress even in salt-tolerant plants. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Carbohydrate; Mineral nutrition; Paclobutrazol; Plant growth; Salinity; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849127041

L. (early purple orchid) relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Orchis mascula is a native herb of the British flora. It is mostly found in woodland, copses, grasslands and open pastures, mostly on neutral or base-rich soils. It can also occur in hedgerows, scrub, on roadsides and railway banks, in grikes on limestone pavement and on moist cliff ledges. It is absent from very acid or very wet sites. It tolerates a sparse to moderately dense canopy, but it does not flower in deep shade. 3. Orchis mascula is a non-bulbous geophyte with little or no capacity for vegetative spread. The main perennating organ is a tuber (strictly a rootstem tuber). In most years the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and, at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is replaced by at least one new tuber. Dormancy, the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, and the subsequent reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons, has been observed, but does not last longer than 1 year. The species is long-lived: it takes at least 4 years from first appearance above-ground to achieve flowering for the first time. The maximum recorded lifetime after first appearance is 13 years. 4. Orchis mascula is not autogamous and pollinators are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Flowers are nectarless, and pollinated by deceit, mainly by bumblebees and solitary bees. Natural levels of fruit set are usually < 20%. Hand-pollination can increase fruit set to approximately 80%, indicating that seed production is strongly pollen-limited. The lowest four flowers are more likely to be pollinated than the upper flowers, probably because pollinators learn to avoid the species after discovering that it offers no reward. 5. As in most other European countries, Orchis mascula has declined in the British Isles, although it is not at threat of extinction at a national level. Most sites from which it has been lost are in central England and Scotland. Most losses have been caused by woodland clearance and coniferization, intensification of grassland management and ploughing. The cessation of traditional coppicing practises has also led to a decline in the abundance of O. mascula. Since the species is slow to colonize new forest stands or grasslands, management should focus mainly on conservation of ancient forest habitats and grasslands in which fertility is moderate to low and grazing is absent or low in intensity. Restoration of traditional coppicing practices could also lead to higher chances of the species flowering and surviving in the long-term. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Ancient woodland; Communities; Conservation; Coppicing; Germination; Pollination; Soils,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60049092918

The outcome of breeding between populations determines the effectiveness of migration and the extent of gene flow. In crosses between populations, it is possible that some traits may indicate isolation and others may not. I measured the rate of successful hand pollination and the fruit production of the resulting hybrid progeny of crosses within and between six populations of the selfing annual Diodia teres. I chose two populations from each of three habitat types to examine evidence for reproductive isolation and heterosis between populations from different habitats. There was postmating/prezygotic isolation in crosses between populations from different habitats and heterosis for fruit production in the F2 progeny of these crosses, as well as crosses between populations from the same habitat type. Specific pairs of populations showed postmating/prezygotic isolation, but there was heterosis for fruit production in some hybrids. Populations that develop postmating/prezygotic isolation may not diverge further if heterosis in the resulting offspring leads to increased gene flow. The heterosis suggests fixed genetic load within some populations, which may be common in selfing species and may limit local adaptation and speciation. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

We assessed the density and species richness of hoverflies in 32 calcareous grasslands, which constitute a semi-natural habitat for adult hoverflies, by means of six transect walks from April to September 2004. Our results show that local habitat factors and landscape factors influenced hoverfly communities, and that their effects on hoverfly richness and density were quite contrary. Hoverfly species richness was affected by factors related to resource heterogeneity such as species richness of flowering plants, area of grassland habitat, and landscape diversity, which all imply the availability of diverse micro- and macrohabitats for adults and larvae. Hoverfly density, in contrast, depended on factors related to resource quantity, such as the amount of pollen and nectar resources for adults and the amount of larval macrohabitats in the surrounding matrix. Therefore, both adult and larval habitat requirements have to be considered when analysing hoverfly communities in agricultural landscapes. Species guilds responded to specific land-use types such as annual crops and woodland at different spatial scales, indicating variation in species' mobility and in the degree of spillover effects among neighbouring landscape elements. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Functional groups; Habitat fragmentation; Land-use intensification; Landscape diversity; Larval habitat requirements; Pollinators; Resource heterogeneity; Resource quantity; Spatial scales; Species-area relationships,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59649083446

H.L. Wendl. (subgenus Phyllodineae) has the potential to be developed as a biomass crop for the agricultural regions of southern Australia. This study examined the reproductive biology of A. saligna to facilitate the domestication and utilization of the species. The reproductive biology of A. saligna was found to be broadly similar to other Australia Acacia in the subgenus Phyllodineae. Flowering conformed to the phases described for other Acacia species. The flowers of A saligna open asynchronously within a flower-head. Female sterility also was observed to occur in A. saligna with extent of sterility being highly variable. Mean reproductive output was found to be low. This work has identified a number of characters that will potentially make controlled crossing in A. saligna practically challenging. If a breeding program for the species is to be established then using open pollination techniques may be more practical and cost effective than controlled crossing. © Royal Society of Western Australia 2009.,Acacia saligna; Floral biology; Pollen quality; Pollen storage and reproductive output; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957304051

We employed floral morphological traits and neutral genetic markers to quantify the frequency of individuals intermediate to the two parental species in two zones of sympatry between Ipomopsis aggregata and I. tenuituba, using clustering methods that make no a priori assumptions about population structure. The sites differed not only in the frequency of intermediate individuals, but also in climate, pollinator abundance and behavior and spatial structure of plant populations. Both floral traits, which are likely to be under natural selection and molecular markers, which are quasi-neutral, indicated more population structure at one site than the other, the pattern being more pronounced for floral morphology. One likely explanation for this difference between sites is that local ecological conditions, particularly pollinator choice of flowers, have promoted different rates of hybridization between these species. Hence, the evolution of reproductive isolation might depend in part on local conditions, and thus differ among populations of the same pair of species. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Hybrid zones; Hybridization rate; Ipomopsis; Mosaic hybrid zone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549104583

Observations showed P. bimaculata visited pistillate-phase inflorescences most frequently during heat generation, whereas C. schawalleri visited regardless of floral stages and heat generation. Chemical analyses of five dominant components of floral odors showed quantities of 2-butanol, veratrole, and ?-pinene during the pistillate phase were the most abundant during all floral stages, and increased during heat generation. When testing combinations of these five authentic chemicals, some mixtures including 2-butanol or veratrole or both attracted both beetles, and veratrole attracted C. schawalleri. These results strongly suggested that the increased emission of floral odor attractants which accompanied heat generation influences floral visitations by P. bimaculata, but not by C. schawalleri.

Floral scent, which differs among S. latifolia individuals and populations, is important for adult Hadena to locate its host. However, the success of moth larvae is strongly reduced if hosts are infected by the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum, a pathogen that is transmitted by flower visitors. There were no qualitative differences between the scent of flowers from healthy and diseased plants. In addition, electroantennographic measurements showed that Hadena responded to the same subset of 19 compounds in samples collected from healthy and diseased plants. However, there were significant quantitative differences in scent profiles. Flowers from diseased plants emitted both a lower absolute amount of floral scent and had a different scent pattern, mainly due to their lower absolute amount of lilac aldehyde, whereas their amount of (E)-?-ocimene was similar to that in healthy flowers. Dual choice behavioral wind tunnel tests using differently scented flowers confirmed that moths respond to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of floral scent, suggesting that they could use differences in floral scent between healthy and infected plants to discriminate against diseased plants. Population mean fruit predation rates significantly increased with population mean levels of the emission rates of lilac aldehyde per flower, indicating that selection on floral scent compounds may not only be driven by effects on pollinator attraction but also by effects on fruit predation. However, variation in mean emission rates of scent compounds per flower generally could not explain the higher fruit predation in populations originating from the introduced North American range compared to populations native to Europe. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anther smut fungus; Dynamic headspace; Electroantennographic measurements; Flower scent; Hadena bicruris; Lilac aldehyde; Microbotryum violaceum; Nursery pollination; Silene latifolia; Wind tunnel biotest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62549107002

A key issue for both basic ecology and conservation is whether the different species within these guilds of mutualist animals are functionally equivalent. Comparing the relative effects of sympatric mutualists is important for understanding the evolution of multispecies mutualisms and for predicting mutualism stability in the face of anthropogenic change. However, empirical comparisons of the population-level impacts of mutualist animals on their host plant are rare, particularly for seed dispersal mutualisms in species-rich ecosystems. We compared the influence of three seed-dispersing tropical mammals, lar gibbons (Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and red muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak), on the demography of a shared host tree in Thailand, Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae). Sambar and muntjac dispersed far more C. axillaris seeds than did gibbons. While sambar deposited many seeds under female tree canopies, muntjac were the only disperser to move seeds to open microhabitats, where C. axillaris seed germination, seedling survival, and initial growth are enhanced. Using stage-based population models, we assessed how disperser-specific seed dispersal, variation in the frequency of canopy gap formation, and their interaction influenced the potential population growth of C. axillaris. Large differences in dispersal quantity and small differences in dispersal quality among sambar and gibbons resulted in similar and negligible impacts on the tree's population dynamics.

We hypothesize that the climbing Bauhinia species will attract targeted pollinators to achieve out-cross success and high levels of self-incompatibility will be expected to maintain diversity, with local population expansion relying on vegetative propagation. All three species have inflorescences consisting of numerous small, pale, fragrant flowers, which show diurnal anthesis. Field observations revealed that all three species are predominantly pollinated by bees (particularly Apis mellifera) and butterflies (Graphium and Papilio species), although B. championii is also pollinated by wasps and flies. Bauhinia corymbosa and B. glauca have sucrose-dominant nectar, whereas B. championii has hexose-dominant nectar. In controlled-pollination experiments fruit and seed set were generally highest following artificial out-crossing. The index of self-incompatibility of B. championii is 1.07, indicating self-compatibility; B. corymbosa and B. glauca were obligately self-incompatible. The population genetic structure and variation of the Bauhinia species was investigated using ISSR markers. Generally the three species have moderate within-population (mean HS = 0.206) and high among-population genetic variation (mean GST = 0.284). No correlation exists between the geographical and genetic distance, possibly due to the small local population size. All three species showed high levels of heterozygosity as expected for predominantly out-crossing long-lived K-selected species.

In this study, we established that the nectar robber Xylocopa sinensis robs nectar only from the hermaphrodite ramets of the gynodioecious plant Glechoma longituba but not from the female ramets. In populations with high rates of nectar robbing, this results in hermaphrodite ramets having reduced seed set whereas the female ramets have a slightly increased seed set. We hypothesize that selective nectar robbing confers an advantage to female individuals and thus ensures their maintenance in gynodioecious populations. Results of controlled experiments indicated that the reduction in the amounts of nectar available occasioned by nectar robbing resulted in some legitimate pollinators switching to visiting flowers on female rather than hermaphrodite ramets. This resulted in lower pollination rates and seed set for hermaphrodites and higher pollination rates and seed set for females.

Despite the availability of basic knowledge on its ecology, little is known of its breeding system and no information is available on its population genetic structure. We explored the within-population genetic structure of this species using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) molecular markers and related this to predictions based on its breeding system, pollen and seed dispersal. Existing information on the reproductive ecology of F. thymifolia was supplemented by artificial pollination experiments. We determined that self-fertilisation can occur in F. thymifolia but results in reduced fruit set. Significant genetic structuring was detected within the population, a likely consequence of localised seed dispersal in combination with a mixed mating system. In a study site covering approximately 0.5 ha, amova revealed that approximately 9% of genetic variability was distributed among population subsamples. Significant spatial genetic structure was detected, with kinship coefficients being significantly elevated above the null expectation in the first six distance classes (maximum 5 m), and a value of Sp of up to 0.0342, comparable with species having similar ecological characteristics. Weak isolation by distance at the plot scale was detected, suggesting that insect-mediated pollen flow is non-random, despite being more extensive than seed dispersal.

It has been in a state of abandonment and destruction since the late 1960s. In 2000, the Japanese government initiated a new environment policy encouraging the use of Satoyama in biodiversity reservation areas. Before the initiation of active restoration works, an assessment of the potential of the Satoyama system is needed. To assess this potential, a study that focused on the foraging ecology of wild bees in a small abandoned Satoyama terraced paddy was carried out from June to October 2003. A total of 372 foraging bees belonging to 35 species in nine families was collected: two species of social bee (Apis cerana and Bombus diversus) and two of solitary bee (Lasioglossum japonicum and Lasioglossum ohei) dominated. The foraging activities of wild bees were highly influenced by the requirement of food for the colony and the active time of solitary bees. In the study, most wild bees showed a strong preference for abundant flowering plant species that produced a large number of flowers (Achyranthes japonica and Polygonum thunbergii). The results showed that an abandoned Satoyama system was an agricultural system that benefited pollinating bees. Careful and planned restoration practices to increase the diversity of foraging resources, microenvironment diversity and potential nesting areas for wild bees are needed to improve the ability of the Satoyama system to support more diverse and abundant wild bee populations. © 2009 The Entomological Society of Korea and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Flowering plant; Pollination; Satoyama; Wild bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62549131577

Co-existing plants and flower-visiting animals often form complex interaction networks. A long-standing question in ecology and evolutionary biology is how to detect nonrandom subsets (compartments, blocks, modules) of strongly interacting species within such networks. Here we use a network analytical approach to (i) detect modularity in pollination networks, (ii) investigate species composition of modules, and (iii) assess the stability of modules across sites. 2. Interactions between entomophilous plants and their flower-visitors were recorded throughout the flowering season at three heathland sites in Denmark, separated by ? 10 km. Among sites, plant communities were similar, but composition of flower-visiting insect faunas differed. Visitation frequencies of visitor species were recorded as a measure of insect abundance. 3. Qualitative (presence-absence) interaction networks were tested for modularity. Modules were identified, and species classified into topological roles (peripherals, connectors, or hubs) using 'functional cartography by simulated annealing', a method recently developed by Guimerà & Amaral (2005a). 4. All networks were significantly modular. Each module consisted of 1-6 plant species and 18-54 insect species. Interactions aggregated around one or two hub plant species, which were largely identical at the three study sites. 5. Insect species were categorized in taxonomic groups, mostly at the level of orders. When weighted by visitation frequency, each module was dominated by one or few insect groups. This pattern was consistent across sites. 6. Our study adds support to the conclusion that certain plant species and flower-visitor groups are nonrandomly and repeatedly associated. Within a network, these strongly interacting subgroups of species may exert reciprocal selection pressures on each other. Thus, modules may be candidates for the long-sought key units of co-evolution. © 2008 The Authors.",Coevolutionary units; Community structure; Compartmentalization; Mutualistic webs; Network topology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59449090368

Commercial blueberry farms use honey bees (Apis mllifera L. ) to provide pollination services, but there is concern regarding their long-term sustainability as crop pollinators. We conducted a 3-yr study at 15 farms to identify the bee community associated with the blueberry agroecosystem in Michigan to improve our understanding of this community and to better target conservation practices. Pan trapping and direct observation were used to determine the relative abundance and diversity of wild bees before, during, and after bloom. We found at least 166 species, representing 30 genera and five families, 112 of which were active during bloom. Most bees captured were solitary, soil-nesting bees. Most species were from subfamily Halictinae (family Halictidae) and genus Andrena (family Andrenidae). Andrena Carolina Viereck, a specialist on Ericaceae, was the most abundant native bee species collected during blueberry bloom. Several native Osmia species that were present in low abundance during bloom are potential targets for management. Honey bees were more often captured in white than in yellow traps, regardless of trap position in the field. Wild bees were more often captured in field perimeters than interiors, but they did not respond differentially to trap color.

Controlled pollination studies showed that the reproductive success (number of seeds produced per flower pollinated) was primarily determined by the female. We aimed to identify the factors contributing to the differences in reproductive success between female genotypes in terms of the physical and anatomical properties of the flower. We studied pairs of genotypes of high and low reproductive success from each of three races (Furneaux Group, Strzelecki Ranges and Western Otways) growing in a seed orchard. Controlled pollinations were performed on six females and along with flower physical measurements, pollen tube growth and seed set were assessed. Overall tree reproductive success was positively correlated with flower size, ovule numbers, style size, cross-sectional area of conductive tissue within the style (all of which were inter-correlated) and the proportion of pollen tubes reaching the bottom of the style. Significant positive correlations of reproductive success and flower physical properties between different ramets of the same genotypes across seasons suggests a genetic basis to the variation observed. The majority of pollen tube attrition occurred within the first millimetre of the cut style and appeared to be associated with differences in style physiology. When examined as pairs within races the difference in reproductive success for the Western Otways pair was simply explained by differences in flower size and the number of ovules per flower. Physical features did not differ significantly for the Strzelecki Ranges pair, but the proportion of pollen tubes reaching the bottom of the style was lower in the less reproductively successful genotype, suggesting an endogenous physiological constraint to pollen tube growth. The difference in reproductive success between the females from the Furneaux Group was associated with a combination of these factors. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Eucalyptus globulus; Flower; Pollen tube; Reproductive success; Style,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549108162

One might expect, however, that the impacts of introduced solitary bees, with much lower population densities and fewer foragers, would be small. Yet little is known about the potential effects of naturalized solitary bees on the environment. We took advantage of the recent naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern Florida to study the effects of this solitary bee on reproduction of Solanum torvum, an invasive shrub. Flowers of S. torvum require specialized buzz pollination. Through timed floral visitor watches and two pollination treatments (control and pollen supplementation) at three forest edge and three open area sites, we found that the fruit set of S. torvum was pollen limited at the open sites where the native bees dominate, but was not pollen limited at the forest sites where the invasive orchid bees dominate. The orchid bee's pollination efficiency was nearly double that of the native halictid bees, and was also slightly higher than that of the native carpenter bee. Experiments using small and large mesh cages (to deny or allow E. viridissima access, respectively) at one forest site indicated that when the orchid bee was excluded, the flowers set one-quarter as many fruit as when the bee was allowed access. The orchid bee was the most important pollinator of the weed at the forest sites, which could pose additional challenges to the management of this weed in the fragmented, endangered tropical hardwood forests in the region. This specialized invasive mutualism may promote populations of both the orchid bee and this noxious weed. Invasive solitary bees, particularly species that are specialized pollinators, appear to have more importance than has previously been recognized. © 2008 GovernmentEmployee: US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.",Buzz pollination; Euglossa viridissima; Invasive mutualism; Pollen limitation; Solanum torvum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60449090701

Flowers of Hoya have generally lost their inner guide rails, while guide rails in Dischidia are more developed and often provided with inner rails. Nectar in Hoya is produced from a tube in the guide rails but also by secondary nectaries positioned inside the anther skirt. The pollinium in this genus is, in the majority of cases, provided with a pellucid margin that is inserted into the guide rails during pollination. Pollinia of Dischidia have crested caudicles, which because of structural similarity to the pellucid margins of Hoya, are hypothesized to fulfill the same function. Pollinia with pellucid margins together with modified guide rails and secondary nectaries inside the anther skirt support the monophyly of Hoya and point to a systematic position of Dischidia outside this genus in the tribe Marsdenieae. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Setaria faberi, commonly known as giant foxtail, is an annual graminaceous weed that is native to eastern China, has colonized eastern North America and is expanding its range westward. This species is primarily self-pollinated and the only mechanism of reproduction is by seed. Adult plants may reach 2 m in height and produce over 2000 seeds per panicle. Seeds may possess non-deep physiological dormancy when freshly produced, and can form small persistent seed banks. If not controlled, S. faberi populations can cause severe yield reductions in corn and soybean crops. Several herbicides are available to provide chemical control; however, resistance to some modes of action, (ALS, ACCase, and Photosystem II) have been identified in Canada and the United States.

Introgression of modified genes can affect conservation of agricultural crops, because there are many cultivars and wild Brassicaceae that may cross with genetically modified OSR (Brassica napus) in Japan. Japan imports more than 2 million tons of OSR a year from Canada and other countries. Since volunteers of GM OSR were found around harbors in 2004, a lot of feral GM OSR was discovered in Japan. To consider the way how to keep domestic Brassicaceae from GM contamination, we surveyed and analyzed the dispersal and persistence of GM OSR around Japanese harbors. We present the cause and abundance of GM OSR in Japan by this paper. Materials and methods: Survey of the feral OSR was performed several times a year at different seasons when domestic OSR either grows or does not around port areas. Detection of herbicide tolerance in feral B. napus was done by test papers that cross react with the modified gene product. Two kinds of herbicide tolerance (glyphosate and glufosinate) were tested. Results: The feral B. napus were discovered around all 13 harbors that import rapeseeds from foreign countries. Genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant OSR were frequently found in the surveyed populations. Two kinds of herbicide-tolerant OSR (glyphosate- and glufosinate-tolerant) were discovered in a natural condition 40 km from port to an oil factory where 60,000 tons of OSR seed are processed a year. The cause of voluntary growth of OSR is seed spillage during transportation by trucks from harbors to oil factories and other processing facilities. Some of the feral OSR growing along the roadsides of transport paths exhibited perennial growth spilling their seeds around the places. Alteration of the generation of feral GM OSR was discovered for the first time in Japan as a result of this study. We studied the yearly change of feral OSR abundances focusing on Yokkaichi port over the 4 years since 2004. The rate of GM OSR increases year to year, and reaches nearly 90% in 2008. Discussion: The possibility and consequences of gene transfer from the genetically modified OSR to domestic species (B. rapa and B. juncea) were discussed in relation to impact on domestic agriculture and on environments. Evolutional meaning of the gene transfer was also discussed with respect to the gene construct of GM OSR. This study shows the importance of another pathway of modified gene transfer to non-GM relative species by seed transportation in addition to pollen transfer from commercial cultivation of genetically modified OSR. Conclusions and recommendations: We identified unintended dispersal and persistence of GM OSR around Japanese harbors that import OSR from Canada and other countries. Both glyphosate- and glufosinate-tolerant feral B. napus were discovered. The cause of volunteer OSR is spillage of the seeds during transportation by truck to oil factory. The feral GM OSR sometimes showed perennial growth in Japanese phonological conditions which are not observed for domestic Brassicaceae. In addition, we confirmed an alteration of generations by feral GM OSR in Japan. The possibility of cross pollination and GM gene introgression to domestic varieties can occur in these environments. To improve the situation, each responsible organization, company, administration, or government should establish measures how to stop the dispersal and persistence of GM OSR in nature. Also, the GM plant developers are responsible for revising this situation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Dispersal and persistence; GM OSR; Introgression; Oilseed rape; Transportation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61349134756

V. darrowii in Florida is quite variable, but most crosses have involved only one V. darrowii clone, Fla. 4B. The use in breeding of a wider range of V. darrowii accessions would provide beneficial diversity in the blueberry cultivated gene pool. The purpose of this research was to determine the functional 2n gamete frequency of numerous V. darrowii genotypes when crossed with tetraploid V. corymbosum, and to study the pollen fertility and backcross ability of the interspecific (V. darrowii × V. corymbosum) hybrids to V. corymbosum.

The unusually high number of hybrids per pollinated flower (HPF) in certain 4x-2x or 2x-4x crosses was attributed to high functional 2n gamete production in certain V. darrowii genotypes. Diploid Vaccinium fuscatum Aiton and diploid V. darrowii × V. fuscatum hybrids, when crossed with southern highbush blueberry cultivars, were equally productive of hybrids whether used as male or female parents.

This indicated that most of these hybrids were tetraploid, because triploid blueberries, like most triploid plants, are highly sterile. Twenty-two V. darrowii × V. corymbosum hybrids were backcrossed to tetraploid highbush blueberry cultivars. Fruit set was variable, but large populations of vigorous hybrids were obtained. Lower fruit set was associated with hybrids that had lower pollen fertility.

The combined analysis of experimental and numerical data allows to elucidate the emission/transport/deposition process in considerable detail.

Most sexual progeny set the same amount of seed when self- or cross- pollinated, indicating an absence of self-incompatibility. Marked variation was observed for growth habit, seasonal growth patterns, and frost resistance among the progeny. Heritability estimates obtained for these characteristics indicate that selection can be successfully used for the genetic improvement of this species. © Crop Science Society of America.

S-allele diversity of cultivars has been extensively investigated; however, no mutant alleles conferring self-compatibility have been reported. In this study, two European pear cultivars, 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño', were classified as self-compatible after fruit/seed setting and pollen tube growth examination. S-genotyping through S-PCR and sequencing identified a new S-RNase allele in the two cultivars, with identical deduced amino acid sequence as S 21, but differing at the nucleotide level. Test-pollinations and analysis of descendants suggested that the new allele is a self-compatible pistil-mutated variant of S 21, so it was named S 21 °. S-genotypes assigned to 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño' were S 10 S 21 ° and S 21 °S 25 respectively, of which S 25 is a new functional S-allele of European pear. Reciprocal crosses between cultivars bearing S 21 and S 21 ° indicated that both alleles exhibit the same pollen function; however, cultivars bearing S 21 ° had impaired pistil-S function as they failed to reject either S 21 or S 21 ° pollen. RT-PCR analysis showed absence of S 21 °-RNase gene expression in styles of 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño', suggesting a possible origin for S 21 ° pistil dysfunction. Two polymorphisms found within the S-RNase genomic region (a retrotransposon insertion within the intron of S 21 ° and indels at the 3?UTR) might explain the different pattern of expression between S 21 and S 21 °. Evaluation of cultivars with unknown S-genotype identified another cultivar 'Azucar Verde' bearing S 21 °, and pollen tube growth examination confirmed self-compatibility for this cultivar as well.

L202 were crossed with O. officinalis. Embryo development and fertilization in these two crosses were comparatively studied. There were no mature hybrid seeds obtained because all the hybridized spikelets died 30 days after pollination. The main reasons for no seed set were abnormal fertilization and development of the embryos and endosperms in the interspecific hybrids. There were double-fertilization, egg cell single-fertilization and non-fertilization in these crosses. Although 59.45% and 54.87% of hybrid embryos produced in the crosses of L202-2x/O. officinalis and L202-4x/O. officinalis, respectively, hybrid embryos ceased to develop or degenerated and plenty of free endosperm nuclei were in disaggregating state without developing cellular endosperms three days after pollination. Besides, some embryological differences in these two crosses were found, that is, the rate of double-fertilization and total rate of double- and single-fertilization in L202-2x/O. officinalis were higher than those in L202-4x/O. officinalis. The embryo and endosperm of hybrids developed more slowly, and embryos and free endosperm nuclei were more severely degenerated in L202-4x/O. officinalis than in L202-2x/O. officinalis. Five days after pollination, a few of embryos in L202-2x/O. officinalis developed into pear-shaped ones, however, embryos in L202-4x/O. officinalis were all degenerated.

As populations become small, the inability to attract sufficient numbers of pollinators can reduce reproduction via pollen limitation. This study experimentally tested whether such trends occur for the herbaceous biennial Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae). We created artificial populations of varying size consisting of potted S. angularis plants in two field sites to determine whether population size affected mean fruit and seed set. We also examined whether population size affected the degree of pollen limitation using a supplemental pollination design in one of the sites. Our results showed that, on average, seed set was lower in large populations, not small populations, of S. angularis and that this result may be due to increased pollen limitation in large populations. We suggest that in certain contexts, small populations may enjoy reproductive advantages over large populations by escaping intraspecific competition for pollinators.",Competition; Facilitation; Pollen limitation; Population size; Reproduction; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349134761

The deduced 636 amino acid sequence showed high identities with other plant soluble acid invertases. Northern blot analysis indicated that CmS-AIV1 was expressed in flowers and fruit, but was not detected in roots, stems or leaves. Moreover, the mRNA accumulation of CmS-AIV1 showed its maximum level at 10 days after pollination (DAP) and decreased gradually during fruit development until its minimum level at mature fruit. Interestingly, the sucrose content was very low in fruit before 20 DAP but increased dramatically between 20 and 30 DAP during fruit development. In contrast to sucrose content, the activities of S-AIV was very high in fruit before 20 DAP and decreased apparently between 20 and 30 DAP, suggesting that sucrose metabolism may be linked to the CmS-AIV1 transcript level in muskmelon fruit. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",CmS-AIV1; Cucumis melo; Gene expression; Sucrose metabolism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549117936

Existing data suggest that the responses of tropical forest plant and animal communities to habitat change are idiosyncratic, although a few consistent patterns are emerging. In particular, it is apparent that conventional diversity and richness metrics may not adequately represent anthropogenic changes to community structure and organisation. A widespread trend is towards 'biotic homogenisation': while disturbed forests may often have an equal or even a greater number of species than undisturbed forests, these species are typically drawn from a restricted pool; and endemic, restricted-range or habitat-specialist species are most likely to decline or go extinct. Similarly, studies have documented marked changes in the structure of food webs, even where the richness and diversity of component species remains little altered. What are the likely consequences of such changes for the important ecosystem functions performed by biodiversity, such as pollination and decomposition? Much of the extensive literature on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is of limited utility for answering this question, because experimental designs do not consider species-specific contributions to ecosystem function, abundance, degree of redundancy, or extinction-proneness; and few such studies have been carried out under realistic levels of diversity under field conditions, particularly in high-diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests. Furthermore, the focus has almost always been on richness as the explanatory variable, rather than the composition or structural attributes of communities. I briefly review recent papers that have begun to tackle these important issues, and consider how future research might help us understand the functional consequences of realistic changes to species composition and food-web 'biostructure' in tropical forests. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Diversity; Ecosystem functioning; Extinction; Food-webs; Interactions; Rainforest; Secondary forests,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59649084830

Treatments were (i) maize cobs protected just after pollination with gauze and stored thereafter, and (ii) unprotected maize cobs as controls. Eight different species of insects were identified in stores. No Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) was found in protected maize during the 6 months of storage, but their mean number reached 239 individuals per kilogram after just 3 months of storage in the unprotected stores. Similarly, significantly more Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) were recovered from the unprotected than the protected maize treatment. Nine fungal species were found to be associated with the storage insects. On non-protected cobs the genus Fusarium (36.05%) was the most frequently identified, followed by Penicillium (23.50%), Rhizoctonia (5.65%) and Aspergillus (3.95%). On protected cobs, Rhizoctonia sp. was most frequent (16.76%), followed by Fusarium spp. (16.62%), Penicillium spp. (8.24%) and Aspergillus spp. (2.33%).

Despite its importance to plant reproduction, little is known about the molecular basis of thermotolerance in pollen tubes. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel Arabidopsis gene, THERMOSENSITIVE MALE STERILE 1 (TMS1), which plays an important role in thermotolerance of pollen tubes. TMS1 encodes a Hsp40-homologous protein with a DnaJ domain and an a-ERdj5-C domain found in protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). Purified TMS1 expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) had the reductive activity of PDI. TMS1 was expressed in pollen grains, pollen tubes and other vegetative tissues, including leaves, stems and roots. Heat shock treatment at 37°C increased its expression levels in growing pollen tubes as well as in vegetative tissues. A knockout mutation in TMS1 grown at 30°C had greatly retarded pollen tube growth in the transmitting tract, resulting in a significant reduction in male fertility. Our study suggests that TMS1 is required for thermotolerance of pollen tubes in Arabidopsis, possibly by functioning as a co-molecular chaperone. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Arabidopsis; Gametophyte; Heat shock protein; Male sterility; Pollen; THERMOSENSITIVE MALE STERILE 1,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61349159187

These interactions vary depending on the stigma type: wet or dry. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) represents a model of wet stigma, and its stigmas/styles express genes to accomplish the appropriate functions. For a large-scale study of gene expression during tobacco pistil development and preparation for pollination, we generated 11,216 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from stigmas/ styles and created the TOBEST database. These ESTs were assembled in 6,177 clusters, from which 52.1% are pistil transcripts/ genes of unknown function. The 21 clusters with the highest number of ESTs (putative higher expression levels) correspond to genes associated with defense mechanisms or pollen-pistil interactions. The database analysis unraveled tobacco sequences homologous to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes involved in specifying pistil identity or determining normal pistil morphology and function. Additionally, 782 independent clusters were examined by macroarray, revealing 46 stigma/style preferentially expressed genes. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments validated the pistilpreferential expression for nine out of 10 genes tested. A search for these 46 genes in the Arabidopsis pistil data sets demonstrated that only 11 sequences, with putative equivalent molecular functions, are expressed in this dry stigma species. The reverse search for the Arabidopsis pistil genes in the TOBEST exposed a partial overlap between these dry and wet stigma transcriptomes. The TOBEST represents the most extensive survey of gene expression in the stigmas/styles of wet stigma plants, and our results indicate that wet and dry stigmas/styles express common as well as distinct genes in preparation for the pollination process. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63549089276

The existence of indirect effects between mycorrhizal fungi and protection-for-food mutualists, such as extrafloral nectar-foraging 'bodyguard ants', is unknown. In this study, we examined the potential for indirect effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on aggressive ant bodyguards, mediated by changes in the expression of extrafloral nectaries of a shared host plant. We found that mycorrhizal plants grew larger and produced more extrafloral nectaries compared to their non-mycorrhizal counterparts. The difference in the number of nectaries between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, however, was too small to elicit differences in ant attendance. In spite of the lack of a significant indirect effect of mycorrhizal fungi on ant attendance, mycorrhizal plants suffered damage to a significantly greater proportion of their leaves compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. This result likely stems from other (non-ant-mediated) indirect effects of mycorrhizal fungi on herbivores. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Formica ravida; Herbivory; Indirect effects; Vicia faba,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61649092251

Although kernel set associated with inbred flowering dynamics is fairly predictable, it has not been possible to predict the level of outcrossing resulting from adventitious pollen entering the seed field. Our objective was to combine our kernel set model with a new Lagrangian pollen dispersal model to determine whether outcrossing could be simulated from flowering dynamics and estimates of pollen drift . This study was conducted in a commercial seed production field in which male and female planting dates were varied to provide a range of flowering synchronies and risk for outcrossing. Kernel production varied from 13.4 × 106 to 24.5 × 106 kernels ha-1. Outcrossing at field locations 100 to 170 m from an adventitious pollen source varied from 1.4 to 18% as determined by allelic variation at 13 loci. The kernel set model accurately simulated variation in kernel production (R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.3 × 106) when silk receptivity was limited to 4 d. Percentage outcrossing due to adventitious pollen also was accurately simulated (R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 0.8) for wind conditions and plant development patterns typically encountered in maize hybrid seed production. The combined kernel set and pollen dispersal models provide a novel and robust approach for defining management strategies to optimize kernel production and genetic purity.

In plants with limited pollen and seed dispersal, post-pollination selection may reduce biparental inbreeding, but knowledge on the prevalence and importance of pollen competition or post-pollination selection after non-self pollination is scarce. We tested whether post-pollination selection favours less related pollen donors and reduces inbreeding in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia. We crossed 20 plants with pollen from a sibling and an unrelated male, and with a mix of both. We found significant inbreeding depression on vegetative growth, age at first flowering and total fitness (22% in males and 14% in females). In mixed pollinations, the unrelated male sired on average 57% of the offspring. The greater the paternity share of the unrelated sire, the larger the difference in relatedness of the two males to the female. The effect of genetic similarity on paternity is consistent with predictions for post-pollination selection, although paternity, at least in some crosses, may be affected by additional factors. Our data show that in plant systems with inbreeding depression, such as S. latifolia, pollen or embryo selection after multiple-donor pollination may indeed reduce inbreeding. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Inbreeding avoidance; Microsatellite DNA; Pollen competition; Relatedness; Seed paternity; Sexual selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549100894

Parentage analysis using 10 microsatellite markers indicated that the 111 adult trees located within a 11.56 ha plot in the Tatera Forest Reserve, Japan, included only one parent of 44.2% and both parents of 40.7% of the 226 saplings located in a 1-ha core plot at its center. Coancestry (Fij) estimates indicated that there was strong genetic structure among the saplings. The numbers of pairs of full- and half-siblings were high among neighboring saplings, suggesting that there was strong maternal half-sibling family structure among the saplings around their seed parents, probably generated by the spatially limited seed dispersal and the small extent of overlapping seed shadows owing to the low density of adults. The frequencies also suggest that the maternal half-sibling families are interspersed with full-siblings, produced by correlated mating, probably because pollination frequency depends on the distance between parents. The frequencies of pairs of half-siblings decreased as the distance between saplings increased, but did not fall to zero even at distances up to the 90-95 m class, suggesting that paternal half-siblings originating from correlated paternity were widely distributed owing to extensive pollen flow. We separately examined the genetic structure for maternal and paternal alleles in the saplings. Unsurprisingly, very strong genetic structure was detected for maternal alleles. However, weak (but significant) genetic structure was also detected for paternal alleles. Therefore, pollen dispersal may affect the extent of genetic structure as well as seed dispersal. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Correlated mating; Correlated paternity; Genetic structure; Parentage analysis; Pollen flow; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549113974

Surprisingly, how the olfactory system maintains identity of complex odors is unclear [6-10]. We took advantage of the plant-pollinator relationship between the Sacred Datura (Datura wrightii) and the moth Manduca sexta [11, 12] to determine how olfactory networks in this insect's brain represent odor mixtures. We combined gas chromatography and neural-ensemble recording in the moth's antennal lobe to examine population codes for the floral mixture and its fractionated components. Although the floral scent of D. wrightii comprises at least 60 compounds, only nine of those elicited robust neural responses. Behavioral experiments confirmed that these nine odorants mediate flower-foraging behaviors, but only as a mixture. Moreover, the mixture evoked equivalent foraging behaviors over a 1000-fold range in dilution, suggesting a singular percept across this concentration range. Furthermore, neural-ensemble recordings in the moth's antennal lobe revealed that reliable encoding of the floral mixture is organized through synchronized activity distributed across a population of glomerular coding units, and this timing mechanism may bind the features of a complex stimulus into a coherent odor percept. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate whether growing at altitude - and the associated change in the dominant pollinator groups present - has an effect on the colour of flowers, we analysed data collected from the Dovrefjell National Park in Norway. Unlike previous studies, however, we considered the flower colours according to ecologically relevant models of bee and fly colour vision and also their physical spectral properties independently of any colour vision system, rather than merely looking at human colour categories. The shift from bee to fly pollination with elevation might, according to the pollination syndrome hypothesis, lead to the prediction that flower colours should shift from more bee-blue and UV-blue flowers (blue/violet to humans, i.e. colours traditionally associated with large bee pollinators) at low elevations to more bee-blue-green and green (yellow and white to humans - colours often linked to fly pollination) flowers at higher altitude. However, although there was a slight increase in bee-blue-green flowers and a decrease in bee-blue flowers with increasing elevation, there were no statistically significant effects of altitude on flower colour as seen either by bees or by flies. Although flower colour is known to be constrained by evolutionary history, in this sample we also did not find evidence that phylogeny and elevation interact to determine flower colours in alpine areas. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Alpine flowers; Flower colour; Insect vision; Pollination; Pollinator diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61749092187

In sweet cherry, we have observed recurrent low fruit set after flower emasculation and compatible pollination without apparent causes. This led us to evaluate its effect on the progress of the reproductive phase and on fruit set in this species. Flower emasculation reduced by more than a half the fruit set obtained in crosses made during two consecutive years. This effect could be traced back to the first week after anthesis where weight increase of pistils from emasculated flowers was smaller and ovule degeneration was accelerated compared to pistils from non-emasculated flowers. Pollen tubes, which behaved similarly at the stigma-style level in emasculated and non-emasculated flowers, lost their directionality in the area close to the degenerated ovule in the ovary.

While we accept the role of such odours in pollinator attraction, we propose that they may also have another, overlooked, anti-herbivore defensive function. We suggest that such odours may deter mammalian herbivores, especially during the critical period of flowering. Carrion odour is a good predictor for two potential dangers to mammalian herbivores: (1) pathogenic microbes, (2) proximity of carnivores. Similarly, dung odour predicts faeces-contaminated habitats that present high risks of parasitism. These are two new types of repulsive olfactory aposematic mimicry by plants: (1) olfactory feigning of carcass (thanatosis), a well-known behavioural defensive strategy in animals, (2) olfactory mimicry of faeces, which also has a defensive visual parallel in animals. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Data on plant phenology in the region of the Chapada Diamantina Mountain Range indicated that our sampling occurred principally during the months of generally greater abundance of floral resources for insect visitors, and that this may have been one of the factors that contributed to the low overlap levels encountered during most months.

A provenance test was conducted with open-pollinated seed from 13 populations collected along an altitudinal transect (3000-3600 m) at the National Park Pico de Tancítaro, Michoacán, center-west Mexico. Height growth of seedlings in a nursery was assessed at seven and 18 months of age. Frost damage at -15 °C was evaluated in laboratory at 18 months of age; proportion of plants that had left grass-stage and stage of shoot development was assessed at the age of 22 months. Significant differences among provenances (P < 0.0001) were detected for all of the evaluated characters. The variation among populations was structured as a moderate altitudinal cline, with populations from lower altitudes showing larger height growth in seedlings, larger proportion of frost damages, fewer seedlings in grass-stage and more seedlings with developed shoot, whereas in populations from higher altitudes, seedlings exhibiting shorter plant height, lower percentages of frost damage, more seedlings with unbroken grass-stage, and fewer seedlings with advanced shoot development were displayed. Options for seed and seedling movement along the altitudinal gradient are discussed under the scope of reforestation, aiming at ecological restoration, conservation of forest genetic resources, and assisted migration considering global warming.

Box 47, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Seed production in tropical timber trees is limited by abiotic resources, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation. Resource availability is influenced by the number of competing trees and by lianas that often reach high densities in disturbed parts of tropical forests. The distance between conspecific trees affects pollination efficiency and seed predation intensity, and may therefore indirectly affect the long-term sustainability of selective logging. Here we investigate how reproductive status and the number of seeds dispersed per tree are affected by liana load, distance to the nearest conspecifics, number of competing neighbours and tree diameter in the timber trees Cariniana ianeirensis and Terminalia oblonga. The study is based on a large-scale silvicultural experiment in lowland Bolivia. We found that the reproductive status of the two species was negatively correlated with liana cover and positively with tree diameter. In C. ianeirensis the most liana-infested trees dispersed fewer seeds. In T. oblonga the intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation decreased with distance to the nearest conspecifics. There was no evidence that seed viability or seed production decreased with distance to nearest conspecifics in either species as would be expected if isolation resulted in increased self-pollination. Our results indicate that reproduction can be severely reduced in timber trees if the largest, most healthy and least liana-covered trees are logged, but that liana cutting on the remaining seed trees can considerably improve seed production. In some species seed production may be further improved by ensuring that seed trees are located far apart. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Pollination systems involving obligate seed parasites are only expected to evolve under rare circumstances where their positive effects are not swamped by abundant co-pollinators and heavy costs resulting from seed destruction. Here, we show that, in Phyllantheae, specialization to pollination by Epicephala moths evolved at least five times, involving more than 500 Phyllantheae species in this obligate association. Active pollination behaviour evolved once in Epicephala, 10-20Myr after the initial divergence of their host plants. The pollinating Epicephala moths thus radiated on an already-diverged host lineage and successively colonized new Phyllantheae hosts, thereby giving rise to repeated independent evolution of the specialized pollination system in Phyllantheae. The present evolutionary success of this association rests entirely upon active pollination by Epicephala, making this a distinct example of an evolutionary key innovation. Overall, our findings provide a clear empirical demonstration of how a combination of evolutionary innovation and partner shifts facilitates the spread of mutualism in a coevolving species interaction. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Active pollination behaviour; Epicephala; Key innovation; Obligate pollination mutualism; Phyllantheae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149124121

Invasion of closed tropical forests is associated with evolution of fleshy fruits. Limited dispersal of such fruits in wet-forest understoreys appears to have accelerated speciation and led to a series of parallel adaptive radiations in Cyanea, with most species restricted to single islands. Consistency of Cyanea diversity across all tall islands except Hawai 'i suggests that diversification of Cyanea saturates in less than 1.5Myr. Lobeliad diversity appears to reflect a hierarchical adaptive radiation in habitat, then elevation and flower-tube length, and provides important insights into the pattern and tempo of diversification in a species-rich clade of tropical plants. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Community assembly; Ecological saturation; Island radiation; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149121740

The media containing XG combined with either PME or PG seemed to show better results for pollen grain viability and fruit set, although the results were variable from year to year. With regard to fruit size, shape and other parameters for fruit quality, spray pollination and hand pollination gave comparable results, irrespective of the medium composition. The time required for spray pollination was less than half of that required for hand pollination, and the amount of pollen grain required for spray pollination was one-third or less than the amount required for hand pollination.

Previous work has suggested that these plants evolved floral traits as adaptations to pollination by flower specialist sunbirds, but subsequently, they appear to have co-opted generalist passerine birds as sub-optimal pollinators. To test this idea, we carried out a quantitative study of the pollination biology of three of the bird-pollinated plants, Canarina canariensis (Campanulaceae), Isoplexis canariensis (Veronicaceae) and Lotus berthelotii (Fabaceae), on the island of Tenerife. Using colour vision models, we predicted the detectability of flowers to bird and bee pollinators. We measured pollinator visitation rates, nectar standing crops as well as seed-set and pollen removal and deposition. These data showed that the plants are effectively pollinated by non-flower specialist passerine birds that only occasionally visit flowers. The large nectar standing crops and extended flower longevities (>10 days) of Canarina and Isoplexis suggests that they have evolved a bird pollination system that effectively exploits these low frequency non-specialist pollen vectors and is in no way sub-optimal. Seed set in two of the three species was high and was significantly reduced or zero in flowers where pollinator access was restricted. In L. berthelotii, however, no fruit set was observed, probably because the plants were self-incompatible horticultural clones of a single genet. We also show that, while all three species are easily detectable for birds, the orange Canarina and the red Lotus (but less so the yellow-orange Isoplexis) should be difficult to detect for insect pollinators without specialised red receptors, such as bumblebees. Contrary to expectations if we accept that the flowers are primarily adapted to sunbird pollination, the chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis) was an effective pollinator of these species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Bird vision; Canary Islands; Mutualism; Pollinator; Tenerife,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249105900

Two species of carpenter bees, Xylocopa verticalis and Xylocopa sp. are the effective pollinators. Pollen grains are deposited on the dorsal surface of the thorax during Xylocopa visit to the flowers in the male phase, and the stigma rubs the pollen-coated thorax and is pollinated when the bees visit the flowers in bisexual and female phases. There is a high level of geitonogamy. Pollination efficiency under field conditions is high (95%). However, fruit set is poor (6%). The species is self-incompatible. None of the self-pollinated flowers sets fruits, but over 50% of the cross-pollinated flowers sets fruits. The results indicate that protandry does not prevent self-pollination, but reduces interference in export and import of pollen. Although the flowers have adapted well to achieve a high level of pollination, reproductive success in terms of fruit set is low, largely due to the limitation of compatible pollen.",Adhatoda vasica; Breeding system; Pollination biology; Protandry; Xylocopa spp,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60649096047

This study investigated the combined effects of leaf herbivory, root herbivory, and pollination on subsequent damage, pollinator preference, and plant performance in a field experiment using butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata). Leaf and root herbivory were manipulated using adult and larval striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum F.), a cucurbit specialist. 3. Leaf herbivory reduced subsequent pistillate floral damage and powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) infection. In spite of these induced defences, the overall effect of leaf herbivory on plant reproduction was negative. Leaf herbivory reduced staminate flower production, fruit number, and seed weight. In contrast, root herbivory had a minimal impact on plant reproduction. 4. Neither leaf nor root herbivory altered pollinator visitation or floral traits, suggesting that reductions in plant performance from herbivory were as a result of direct rather than indirect effects.

Blue Hubbard (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) is a highly effective trap crop for butternut squash (C. moschata Duch. ex Poir) attacked by striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum Fabricius), but its limited marketability may reduce adoption of PTC by growers. Research comparing border crop varieties is necessary to provide options for growers. Furthermore, pollinators are critical for cucurbit yield, and the effect of PTC on pollination to main crops is unknown. We examined the effect of five border treatments on herbivory, pollination, and yield in butternut squash and manipulated herbivory and pollination to compare their importance for main crop yield. Blue Hubbard, buttercup squash (C. maxima Duch.), and zucchini (C. pepo L.) were equally attractive to cucumber beetles. Border treatments did not affect butternut leaf damage, but butternut flowers had the fewest beetles when surrounded by Blue Hubbard or buttercup squash. Yield was highest in the Blue Hubbard and buttercup treatments, but this effect was not statistically significant. Native bees accounted for 87% of pollinator visits, and pollination did not limit yield. There was no evidence that border crops competed with the main crop for pollinators. Our results suggest that both buttercup squash and zucchini may be viable alternatives to Blue Hubbard as borders for the main crop of butternut squash. Thus, growers may have multiple border options that reduce pesticide use, effectively manage pests, and do not disturb mutualist interactions with pollinators. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Apis mellifera; Bombus spp.; Multispecies interactions; Peponapis pruinosa; Winter squash,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61849090731

In the stamen, the appropriate growth of the filament, which largely depends on the mechanical properties of the cell wall, is required to position the anther correctly close to the stigma at the pollination stage. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family of enzymes that mediate the construction and restructuring of xyloglucan cross-links, thereby controlling the extensibility or mechanical properties of the cell wall in a wide variety of plant tissues. Our reverse genetic analysis has revealed that a loss-of-function mutation of an Arabidopsis XTH family gene, AtXTH28, led to a decrease in capability for self-pollination, probably due to inhibition of stamen filament growth. Our results also suggest that the role of AtXTH28 in the development of the stamen is not functionally redundant with its closest paralog, AtXTH27. Thus, our finding indicates that AtXTH28 is specifically involved in the growth of stamen filaments, and is required for successful automatic self-pollination in certain flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana. © The Author 2009.

Life forms in the genus correlate with pollination types (anemophily, epihydrophily and hydroautogamy). Floral traits vary greatly among different life forms and pollination types. Both floating and submerged broad-leaved species produce erect inflorescences that are suited for anemophilous pollination. These flowers also have the highest pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio (25,013) and the smallest pollen grain volume (6046 ?m3). On the contrary, submerged filiform-leaved species produce only floating inflorescences and their flowers produce the largest pollen grains (17,567 ?m3) and have the lowest P/O ratio (6752), which is typical of the syndromes of hydroautogamy and epihydrophily. The relatively prolific seed production (about 70%) and wide dispersal in the floating and submerged broad-leaved species and the submerged filliform-leaved species indicate that these two groups are well adapted to the aquatic environment. This is in contrast with the less well-adapted complex and unstable pollination system found in linear-leaved species.

We conducted bird exclusion experiments to establish the contribution that bees make to the female component of pollination success of five ""ornithophilous"" Aloe species in the succulent-rich subtropical thicket vegetation in southeastern South Africa. Experiments showed that all five aloes are genetically self-incompatible and require cross-pollination for seed set. Seed set in flowers exposed to both bird and bee visitors was generally several fold higher than in flowers exposed to bee visitors only. The magnitude of this effect varied greatly among species and was affected by floral traits and bee behavior. In three aloes where the relatively short corolla tubes are blocked by exserted filaments, bees made a negligible contribution to seed production. However, in two aloes with long tubular flowers and included filaments, bees often crawled into the perianth tube to obtain nectar and contributed to seed production.

The hide beetle Dermestes maculatus (Tenebrionidae) accounted for 76.9% of the imprisoned insects, with a density of 2.2 ± 0.6 per flower. The D. maculatus addition experiment (n = 9) clearly demonstrated imprisonment during the carpellate stage. Changes in the inner surfaces of the androecial chamber, stippling, and texturing allowed D. maculatus to escape after pollen release. More than 55.5% of the beetles escaped, dusted with pollen, within 3 d after pollen release. Pollen was still viable 3 d after pollen release. The beetle addition and pollen assays demonstrate the efficiency of the H. africana imprisonment mechanism. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Pollinator movements in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum & Nakai) were determined by tracking pollen flow with the incompletely dominant lobed-leaf trait of 'Crimson Sweet' (Nl) as the pollen donor and the incompletely recessive 'Sunshade' (nl) as the recipient. Mature 'Sunshade' watermelon fruit were collected at 3-m increments down selected rows and across all rows in both directions from the central donor plants that made up 1% of the planting. The resulting progenies from each fruit collected were screened to determine the directionality of pollinator movements by the occurrence of the Nlnl genotype (or lobed-leaf phenotype). The row that went through the central donor plant block had higher percentages of lobed-leaf seedlings compared with the other rows evaluated. However, lobed-leaf seedlings were observed on rows at significant distances (greater than 10 m) from the donor block. This resulted most likely from long-distance pollen transport, in-hive pollen transfer, or multiple transfers of pollen to staminate (male) and/or pistillate (female) flowers by pollinators before reaching the final destination on a stigmatic surface at a substantial distance from donor plants. Because watermelon vines grow out in all directions, including across rows, a pollinator can easily move to adjacent flowers on a vine growing across rows; thus, the movements of pollinators in watermelon (and most likely other vining cucurbits) are not as simple as maintaining a linear direction down the row.",Apis mellifera; Citrullus lanatus; Gene flow; Pollen flow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849142530

The flowering patterns of invasive alien plant species and related natives were studied in three regions with Mediterranean-type climate: California, Spain and South Africa's Cape region.  Methods: A total of 227 invasive-native pairs were compared for seven character types across the regions, with each pair selected on the basis that they shared the same habitat type within a region, had a common growth form and pollination type, and belonged to the same family or genus.  Key Results: Invasive alien plant species have different patterns of flowering phenology from native species in the three regions. Whether the alien species flower earlier, later or at the same time as natives depends on the climatic regime in the native range of the aliens and the proportion of species in the invasive floras originating from different regions. Species invading at least two of the regions displayed the same flowering pattern, showing that flowering phenology is a conservative trait. Invasive species with native ranges in temperate climates flower earlier than natives, those from Mediterranean-type climates at the same time, and species from tropical climates flower later. In California, where the proportion of invaders from the Mediterranean Basin is high, the flowering pattern did not differ between invasive and native species, whereas in Spain the high proportion of tropical species results in a later flowering than natives, and in the Cape region early flowering than natives was the result of a high proportion of temperate invaders.  Conclusions: Observed patterns are due to the human-induced sympatry of species with different evolutionary histories whose flowering phenology evolved under different climatic regimes. The severity of the main abiotic filters imposed by the invaded regions (e.g. summer drought) has not been strong enough (yet) to shift the flowering pattern of invasive species to correspond with that of native relatives. It does, however, determine the length of the flowering season and the type of habitat invaded by summer-flowering aliens. Results suggest different implications for impacts at evolutionary time scales among the three regions. © The Author 2008.

Bumble bees occupy a wide range of habitats from the Nearctic to the Tropics in which they play an important role as pollinators. However, little is known about how a bumble bee colony regulates pollen collection. We manipulated protein quality and colony pollen stores in lab-reared colonies of the native North American bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. We debut evidence that bumble bee colony foraging levels and pollen storage behavior are tuned to the protein quality (range tested: 17-30% protein by dry mass) of pollen collected by foragers and to the amount of stored pollen inside the colony. Pollen foraging levels (number of bees exiting the nest) significantly increased by 55%, and the frequency with which foragers stored pollen in pots significantly increased by 233% for pollen with higher compared to lower protein quality. The number of foragers exiting the nest significantly decreased (by 28%) when we added one pollen load equivalent each 5 min to already high intranidal pollen stores. In addition, pollen odor pumped into the nest is sufficient to increase the number of exiting foragers by 27%. Foragers directly inspected pollen pots at a constant rate over 24 h, presumably to assess pollen levels. Thus, pollen stores can act as an information center regulating colony-level foraging according to pollen protein quality and colony need. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Collective behavior; Communication; Foraging; Information flow; Recruitment; Social insect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58649108541

Two closely related South American Nothofagus species were compared with regard to the differentiation times and positions of staminate and pistillate flowers along their parent growth units (GUs) by quantitative means.  Methods: Two samples of GUs that had extended in the 2004-2005 growing season were taken in 2005 and 2006 from trees in the Lanín National Park, Patagonia, Argentina. For the first sample, axillary buds of the parent GUs were dissected and the leaf, bud and flower primordia of these buds were identified. The second sample included all branches derived from the parent GUs in the 2005-2006 growing season.  Key Results: Both species developed flowering GUs with staminate and/or pistillate flowers; GUs with both flower types were the most common. The position of staminate flowers along GUs was similar between species and close to the proximal end of the GUs. Pistillate flowers were developed more distally along the GUs in N. alpina than in N. obliqua. In N. alpina, the nodes bearing staminate and pistillate flowers were separated by one to several nodes with axillary buds, something not observed in N. obliqua. Markovian models supported this between-species difference. Flowering GUs, including all of their leaves and flowers were entirely preformed in the winter buds.  Conclusions: Staminate and pistillate flowers of N. alpina and N. obliqua are differentiated at precise locations on GUs in the growing season preceding that of their antheses. The differences between N. alpina and N. obliqua (and other South American Nothofagus species) regarding flower distribution might relate to the time of anthesis of each flower type and, in turn, to the probabilities of self-pollination at the GU level. © The Author 2008.

The BCA tested was Bacillus subtilis, strain BD170 (Biopro®) developed for the control of the 'fire blight' caused by Erwinia amylovora (Burril) Winslow et al. The two insect species were studied as secondary BCA carriers on apple plants in pots under net screened tunnels. Their behaviour and capacity to deposit the BCA in the most receptive flower parts were compared both by washing, diluting and plating the flower organs on a recovery medium and by means of PCR analyses based on a molecular marker. O. cornuta showed better performances with respect to A. mellifera. For the field trials, pollinators were introduced in four apple orchards. During apple's flowering, the BD170 (100 g hl-l) was sprayed once in two fields, and twice in the others. The pollinators' efficacy in carrying the BCA from sprayed flowers to the stigmas of newly opened ones at different times after the spray treatment was evaluated. The detection of the BCA was performed by PCR analysis. The percentages of positive PCR flower samples were higher in the internal treated areas of the fields with respect to the external untreated ones, but the high colonisation level found in the latter and in the flowers opened in both areas several days after the treatment(s) demonstrated that pollinators can play an important role as secondary carriers. © 2008 International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).",Apidae; Apis mellifera; Apple; Bacillus subtilis; Biocontrol agent carrier; Erwinia amylovora; Hymenoptera; Megachilidae; Osmia cornuta; Secondary colonisation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149186823

Pollination is a vital ecosystem service, which is endangered by the ongoing declines of pollinators. These declines also affect bumblebees (Bombus spp.), which are important generalist pollinators in agricultural landscapes. Most studies focussing on the conservation of bumblebees have investigated the effects of local flower-rich habitats on bumblebee density and diversity. However, bumblebee densities do not necessarily correlate with the colonies' reproductive success (i.e. the presence or absence of males and/or queens). 2. We analysed the effects of landscape-wide availability of mass flowering oilseed rape Brassica napus on the growth and sexual reproduction of Bombus terrestris colonies. Thirty-two young colonies were established and monitored in different resource environments represented by 16 landscapes (circular study areas with 3000 m radius) with large or small amounts of oilseed rape. As an indicator of colony growth, we used weight gain, which was strongly correlated with the numbers of brood cells in the colonies. 3. The colonies gained significantly more weight in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape particularly during early colony stages. 4. Despite early weight gain, the colonies in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape did not reproduce more successfully. The frequencies of colonies that produced males and/or queens did not differ between the two resource environments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Early mass flowering oilseed rape has a beneficial effect on colony growth, which however, does not translate into a greater likelihood of colonies producing sexual offspring. This may be due to food plant scarcity later in the colony cycle. Conservation measures should enhance food plant availability in agricultural landscapes, particularly during the most critical phases of the colony cycle: the colony establishment in spring and the reproductive phase in mid- to late summer. © 2008 The Authors.",Agroecosystems; Bombus terrestris; Bumblebee conservation; Ecosystem services; Forage plants; Landscape-scale study; Mass flowering crops; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249097189

Not affected or little affected and moderately to severely affected trees were observed in all progenies. However, great quantitative differences among them were observed. In the progenies of about one third of the pollinated trees most of the individuals showed a high level of resistance to grafted trees. Significantly different from this group was another third of the progenies that mostly showed high susceptibility in grafted trees. Between these two groups there were progenies that statistically neither differed from the resistant nor from the susceptible group. These progenies were defined as moderately resistant. Significant differences in resistance were also observed between progenies of genotypes of the same species that originated from different locations.

Generally, flowers that have spatial and/or temporal precedence are more likely to set fruits. We sought to separate these factors by comparing patterns of fruit set on inflorescences of two species of Telopea (Proteaceae); one that flowers from the tip to the base of the rachis, the other from base to tip. In both species, most fruits were set at the top of the inflorescence (the last flowers to open for T. speciosissima) and this was extreme for T. mongaensis, where the top flowers open first. Fruit set was not generally limited by inadequate pollination for either T. mongaensis or T. speciosissima, as hand pollinations did not increase fruit set and many abscised flowers contained pollen tubes. In T. speciosissima, we tested whether removal of developing topmost fruits would 'release' those that had initiated but not yet aborted lower down. There was no significant effect. Plant hormones can increase the degree to which a developing fruit is a sink for nutrients, so we applied cytokinin to the developing lower fruits on some inflorescences. There was no significant effect of the hormone treatment. We conclude that temporal precedence may contribute to the skewed pattern of fruit set in T. mongaensis, because there was an extreme concentration of fruit set on the distal part of the inflorescences, but it cannot explain this pattern of fruit set in T. speciosissima, where the distal flowers are the last to open. Some other process must therefore constrain fruit set to the topmost flowers in an inflorescence. While cytokinin application had no significant effect, the power of this experiment was low and we consider that the hypothesis of hormonal control is worth further exploration. © 2009 The Authors.",Breeding system; Fruit set; Pollination; Proteaceae; Telopea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249116643

In the present study, we analysed the functional relationship between flower morphology and nectar robbing, and examined the reproductive consequences of the interaction in a population of Duranta erecta (Verbenaceae) on the island of Cuba. The results show that nectar robbing is conducted by the carpenter bees Xylocopa cubaecola and affects up to 44% of flowers in the studied population. However, not all the flowers have the same probability of being robbed. The chance of flowers being robbed increases with flower length and flower diameter. Moreover, nectar robbing significantly decreases the chance that flowers will set fruit. Also, the impact of nectar robbing on the probability of flowers to set fruits is dependent on the plant. We suggest that nectar robbing may represent an opposite selective force that balances the selection for longer corollas often imposed by pollinators specializing in visiting tubular flowers.

This study investigated whether the contamination was due to the competitive superiority of southern pollen by carrying out competition trials using mixtures of pollen from northern and southern populations of Scots pine. Trials were performed in a southerly seed orchard established with clones originating from northern populations. Seed paternity (siring) was determined through the analysis of allozyme variation. Southern genotypes sired significantly more seeds (76%) than their northern competitors and across all mixed-pollen crosses. Maternal genotype had no effect on seed siring success. The mean flower abortion rate was lower in southern pure-pollen crosses and mixed-pollen crosses than in northern pure-pollen crosses. The results show that local pollen may induce high levels of background pollination in southern seed orchards composed of northern genotype grafts. These results must be taken into account when aiming to produce suitable reforestation material for northern areas. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.,Background pollination; Competition crosses; Pollen competition; Pollen contamination; Seed siring success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61949476986

Euglossine bees are an ecologically important Neotropical clade of forest-dependent pollinators. Despite the fact that euglossines are well studied relative to other groups of tropical bees, only three previous studies, all from Brazil, address the response of euglossines to forest fragmentation. In this study, I tripled the maximum sample size of previous efforts by sampling male euglossines in 22 forest fragments ranging in area from 0.25 ha to 230 ha in southern Costa Rica, using chemically baited Van Someren traps. Abundance of euglossine bees was significantly positively related to forest fragment size, negatively related to shape (edge:area ratio), and marginally related to fragment isolation. Euglossine species richness showed similar, but weaker trends: richness was significantly positively related to the quantity of forest edge, marginally negatively related to fragment area, and not related to fragment isolation. The positive relationship between euglossine richness and abundance and forest fragment edge is consistent with other studies that have found high euglossine density in secondary or disturbed forest. The data suggest that individual euglossines move between forest fragments, as has been shown in other systems. Still, forest fragmentation appears to affect euglossine bees more strongly than other bee groups in the study region. Their large flight range and positive relationship with forest edges may help to buffer the negative effects of fragmentation, allowing euglossines to utilize even the very smallest forest fragments in the study area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In many species, this does not occur, suggesting the possibility of adaptive reasons for retaining selfed or inbred seeds that are aborted at relatively late developmental stages. We propose that such seeds serve an important function in diluting the impact of pre-dispersal seed predators by acting as seed predator sinks and thereby increasing the survival probabilities of outcrossed and fully viable seeds.

We assessed to what extent alpine plants are pollen limited, and whether the intensity of PL differs between alpine and lowland species. Moreover, we assessed whether or not PL of alpine species depends on their reproductive system and, finally, whether the outcome of PL studies depends on whether supplemental-pollination was done at the whole-plant level or within a subset of available flowers. We performed both classical and phylogenetic meta-analysis. Our results show that alpine plants are pollen limited. However, PL did not differ significantly between alpine and lowland species.

We conducted three field experiments to investigate whether the ""hesitation behaviour"" of hoverflies Sphaerophoria spp., moving backwards and forwards in front of a flower, is effective in avoiding ambush predators on flowers. First, we compared the behaviour of different flower visitors, including several bees and other hoverflies, with Sphaerophoria spp. behaviour. Only Sphaerophoria spp. exhibited the hesitation behaviour in front of flowers. The flight behaviour was observed more frequently before landing on flowers than on leaves. Second, we investigated rejection by Sphaerophoria spp. to artificially placed corpses of the crab spider Thomisus labefactus. The rejection rate of flowers with a crab spider placed on or under it was significantly higher than that of non-treated flowers. Moreover, the presence of a spider on the flower decreased the number of hesitation displays, compared with non-treated flowers. Finally, to determine whether hesitation behaviour could be a consequence of floral assessment, we investigated hoverfly rejection of previously foraged flowers. Sphaerophoria spp. did not reject flowers that had been visited by the same individual or conspecifics within 3 min. We suggest that hesitation behaviour may be adaptive, enabling assessment of predation risk and hence avoiding ambush predators on flowers. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Antipredator strategy; Behavioural adaptation; Floral assessment; Predation risk; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249108047

Ökologie, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Mainz, Germany","Aim: Natural and human-induced differences in frugivore assemblages can influence the seed dispersal distances of trees. An important issue in seed dispersal systems is to understand whether differences in seed dispersal distances also affect the genetic structure of mature trees. One possible approach to test for a relationship between seed dispersal and the genetic structure of mature trees is to compare the genetic structure of two closely related tree species between two biogeographical regions that differ in frugivore assemblages and seed dispersal distances. Previous studies on two Commiphora species revealed that Commiphora guillauminii in Madagascar has a much lower seed dispersal distance than Commiphora harveyi in South Africa. We tested whether the lower seed dispersal distance might have caused decreased gene flow, resulting in a stronger genetic structure in Madagascar than in South Africa. Location: Madagascar and South Africa. Methods: Using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers we investigated the genetic structure of 134 trees in Madagascar and 158 trees in South Africa at a local and a regional spatial scale. Results: In concordance with our hypothesis, kinship analysis suggests that gene flow was restricted mostly to 3 km in Madagascar and to 30 km in South Africa. At the local spatial scale, the genetic differentiation among groups of trees within sample sites was marginally significantly higher in Madagascar (FST = 0.069) than in South Africa (FST = 0.021). However, at a regional spatial scale genetic differentiation was lower in Madagascar (FST = 0.053) than in South Africa (FST = 0.163). Main conclusions: Our results show that lower seed dispersal distances of trees were linked to higher genetic differentiation of trees only at a local spatial scale. This suggests that seed dispersal affects the genetic population structure of trees at a local, but not at a regional, spatial scale. © 2008 The Authors.",AFLP; Commiphora; Frugivore assemblage; Gene flow; Madagascar; Pollination; South Africa; Spatial structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58449099949

The surface pollen percentages were compared to the phytosociological composition of the respective vegetation types in 18 sampling points using both descriptive and numerical approaches. Hyrcanian lowland forests are characterized by pollen assemblages dominated by Quercus, Carpinus betulus and low amounts of Zelkova carpinifolia. Both Parrotia persica and Z. carpinifolia show a very low pollen representation in modern pollen samples, an under-representation that should be taken into account in the interpretation of fossil pollen diagrams. Transitional communities between the forest and steppe including Acer monspessulanum subsp. turcomanicum, Crataegus and Paliurus scrubs, Juniperus excelsa woodlands and shrub-steppe patches are more difficult to distinguish by pollen assemblages but are characterized by higher values of the dominant shrub species. The transitional communities at the immediate vicinity of the forest show also a substantial amount of grass pollen. Many insect-pollinated taxa are strongly under-represented in pollen rains including most of the rosaceous trees and shrubs, and Rhamnus, Paliurus, Acer and Berberis.

Matsum. and Nak.] pollen is nonviable; thus, diploid (pollenizer) watermelon cultigens are required to supply viable pollen for triploid watermelon fruit set. The objective of this research was to characterize maximum potential vegetative growth, staminate and pistillate flower production over time, and measure exterior and interior fruit characteristics of pollenizer cultigens. Sixteen commercially available and numbered line (hereafter collectively referred to as cultigens) pollenizer and two triploid cultigens were evaluated in 2005 and 2006 at Clayton, NC. Vegetative growth was measured using vine and internode length, and staminate and pistillate flower development was counted weekly. Fruit quality and quantity were determined by measuring individual fruit weights, soluble solids, and rind thickness. Based on vegetative growth, pollenizer cultigens were placed into two distinct groups. Pollenizers, which produced a compact or dwarf plant were 'Companion', 'Sidekick', 'TP91', 'TPS92', and 'WC5108-1216'. Pollenizers having a standard vine length were 'Jenny', 'High Set 11', 'Mickylee', 'Minipol', 'Pinnacle', 'Summer Flavor 800' ('SF800'), 'Super Pollenizer 1' ('SP1'), and 'WH6818'. Cultigens with compact growth habit had shorter internodes and vine lengths compared with the cultigens with standard growth habit. Cultigens with the greatest quantity of staminate flower production through the entire season were 'Sidekick' and 'SP1'. The lowest number of staminate flowers was produced by 'TP91' and 'TPS92'. Based on fruit quality characteristics and production, pollenizers currently or possibly marketed for consumption include 'Mickylee', 'SF800', 'Minipol', 'Jenny', and 'Pinnacle'. The remaining cultigens evaluated in this study should be used strictly as pollenizers based on fruit quality. Arrangement of diploid pollenizers in a commercial planting of triploid watermelons is an important consideration depending on plant vegetative development. Based on staminate flower production, cultigens with higher staminate flower production are potentially superior pollenizers and may lead to improved triploid quality and production. Furthermore, pollenizer selection by fruit characteristics should include a rind pattern easily distinguished from triploid fruit in the field.",Citrullus lanatus; Diploid; Pollination; Seedless; Triploid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849149933

In fact, improving plant tolerance to water stress is an important, but, at the same time, a difficult task, since plant tolerance is the result of many complex mechanisms acting at different levels of plant organization, and its genetic basis is largely unknown. The phenotypic data, concerning yield components and flowering time, of a population of 142 maize Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs), grown under well watered conditions or under water stress, were submitted to linkage analysis to detect drought-tolerance QTLs. Thirty genomic regions containing 50 significant QTLs distributed on nine chromosomes were identified. At the same time, a customized targeted oligoarray was used to monitor the expression levels of 1,000 genes, representative of the immature maize kernel transcriptome. Using this DNA array we compared transcripts from 10 days after pollination kernels of two susceptible and two drought tolerant genotypes (extracted from our RILs) grown under control and water stress field conditions. Two hundred and fifty-two genes were significantly affected by stress in at least one genotype. From a set of these, 49 new molecular markers were developed. By mapping most of them and by in silico mapping other regulated sequences, 88 differentially expressed genes were localized onto our linkage map, which, added to the existing 186 markers, brought their total number on the map to 274. Twenty-two of the 88 differentially expressed genes mapped in the same chromosomal segments harbouring QTLs for tolerance, thus representing candidate genes for further functional studies. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Drought stress; Maize; QTL mapping; Transcription profiling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59449108825

Three S-genotypes, S9Sc (Sc, self-compatibility S-gene absent from the style), S 8S9, and S8S10, were obtained. Seedlings with S-RNase that migrated as a single band in gel electrophoresis were SC, despite high transcript abundance, and those with S-RNase that migrated as two bands were SI with high transcript abundance or SC with low transcript expression. S8-RNase was induced in SI cultivars only 24 h after self-pollination, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of S 8-RNase in SI apricots. A Proteomic study showed that 35 protein spots were synthesized differently between SC and SI pistils. Fifteen of the 35 protein spots were identified; nine proteins, including receptor protein kinase-like protein, reversibly glycosylated polypeptide-2, and isoflavone reductase-like protein, were detected only in the SC pistils; while nine proteins, including actin 7, a putative serine/threonine kinase, and S-RNase, were detected only in the SI pistils. A mitochondrial NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase and a probable elongation factor G were up-regulated, while heat shock cognate 70 was down-regulated in the SC pistils compared to those in the SI pistils.

However, there is little information on interspecific and interploid crossability and ploidy levels of specific cultivars. The objectives of this study were to determine the ploidy levels and relative DNA contents (genome sizes) of selected species and cultivars, to evaluate self-compatibility and crossability among species and ploidy levels, and to explore reproductive pathways in triploid R. hirta L. with the goal of facilitating future breeding endeavors and development of new hybrids. Reciprocal interspecific crosses were performed between R. hirta cultivars and R. fulgida Ait., R. missouriensis Engelm. ex C.L. Boynton &amp; Beadle, and R. subtomentosa Pursh. as well as reciprocal interploid crosses among four R. hirta cultivars. A combination of relative DNA content analysis and chromosome counts was used to test for hybridity and to determine ploidy levels for selected species, cultivars, and interploid R. hirta F1 hybrids. Of the specific clones tested, R. subtomentosa and R. missouriensis were diploid, R. fuligida varieties were tetraploid, and R. hirta include both diploid and tetraploid cultivars. Mean 1Cx DNA content varied over 320% among species. The interploid R. hirta crosses produced triploids as well as pentaploids and hexaploids. Seedlings from open-pollinated triploid R. hirta appeared, based on diverse phenotypes and DNA contents, to be aneuploids resulting from sexual fertilization, not apomixis. Of the 844 seedlings from interspecific F 1 crosses, only one individual, R. subtomentosa x R. hirta, had a DNA content intermediate between its parents and was confirmed as the only interspecific hybrid. Although most taxa had low self-fertility, seedlings (with genomic sizes similar to their maternal parent) resulted after interspecific crosspollination, indicating that pseudogamy is one reproductive pathway in Rudbeckia species.",Apomixis; Coneflower; Cytology; DNA content; Flow cytometry; Plant breeding; Polyploidy; Pseudogamy; Relative genome size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849130645

The OPFs had previously been identified as differing in their susceptibility to defoliation by P. atomaria in forestry progeny trials. 2 Oviposition preference for resistant and susceptible foliage was tested using binary choice tests. These tests did not demonstrate any significant preference for either resistant or susceptible open-pollinated material indicating that adult host preference for susceptible trees was not a likely cause of differential defoliation. 3 Quantification and analysis of growth and development parameters for all larval stages of P. atomaria showed that feeding on genetic material identified as resistant resulted in a significant reduction of relative growth rate of first instar larvae and an alteration to normal feeding behaviour. There was also a trend towards increased larval mortality on resistant E. grandis. 4 We argue that although the magnitude of these effects was minor, interactions with additional biotic and abiotic sources of mortality in the field have the potential, when magnified over successive generations, to result in significant variation in defoliation of host genotypes in the field. © 2008 The Authors.",Defence; Herbivory; Host variation; Oviposition; Plant resistance; Plant-insect interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549090533

This is the first report on the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in this plant, describing floral ontogeny, pollination and the breeding system. The cytohistological zonation of the apical meristem of the reproductive thallus is identical to that of the apical meristem of the vegetative thallus. The floral shoots do not replace vegetative shoots (i.e. the vegetative shoots never bear flowers), but form at new sites at the tip of the flattened plant body. Each floral shoot meristem is tiny, deep-seated and concave and arises endogenously following lysigeny. The floral shoot meristem gives rise to four to six bracts in a distichous manner. The development of spathe, stamens and carpels is described. The ab initio dorsiventrality of the carpels and the occurrence of endothelium in the ovules are reported. The mature stigmas and anthers lie close to each other. The pollen germinates within undehisced anthers and the pollen tubes enter the stigmas in the unopened floral bud, leading to pre-anthesis, complete, constitutional cleistogamy under water. The seed set is 63.2%. A significant finding is the penetration of several pollen tubes into the filaments of stamens in 16% of the flower buds, indicating a trend towards cryptic self-fertilization. The Indian Podostemoideae appear to show a shift from xenogamy or geitonogamy or autogamy in a chasmogamous flower to complete autogamy in a cleistogamous flower.

Based on this finding, the subsequent examination of pollen according to size decrease was put into operation as a method of pollen modification for the study. The structural mechanisms of pollen metamorphosis were identified as not being species specific but rather universal. These mechanisms are suggested to be the shrinkage of the pollen vegetative cytoplasm, the intine enlargement, the deepening of three colporate apertures provided by exine sunken into enlarged intine areas, the aperture accretion as well as the transformation of the exine from thick/sculptured into thin/less sculptured. During size-reducing metamorphosis, the pollen grains changed dramatically, going through a species-specific set of intermediate morphs to the final species-specific morphotype. In P. ginseng this morphotype is round (diameter is about 16 m), in A. elata it is round with a single projection (diameter is about 15 m) and in O. elatus it is ovoid with a single projection (average diameter is about 18 m). In addition, every species is peculiar in having the unique vegetative cytoplasm inclusions and individual construction of the largest pollen exine. From a phylogenetic perspective, these findings presumably add support to the option of equal remoteness of P. ginseng from A. elata and O. elatus. The characteristics found seem to be suitable for examination of Panax affinity, by the subsequent study of more Araliaceae representatives. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",Aralia elata; Araliaceae; Oplopanax elatus; Panax ginseng; Pollen diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64949107148

Location: Eleven sites in Europe and one in Israel undergoing transitions in land use. Material and Methods: Standardised methods were used to collect information on species traits and attributes from plots covering a range of land uses at each site. This was combined with abundance data to create a plot x trait matrix. Variance partitioning was used to identify the relative roles of climate, soil and management on the weighted and unweighted mean traits of the vegetation in the fuU data set, and the data set divided into vegetative traits (including life-form, clonality, defence and a range of leaf traits) and traits linked to regeneration via seeds (including seed mass, dispersal and pollination mechanism). Results: Variance partitioning of the full data set showed that climate (18.7%), explained more variance in the weighted mean traits of the vegetation than climate and soil together (9.2), soil (6.9) and management (6.1). There was a similar distribution of variance explained for both vegetative and regeneration via seed traits, although more variance was explained for the latter. This restricted set of climatic, edaphic and management variables could explain 45-50% of the variance in the weighted mean traits of the vegetation between plots. There were only small differences between analyses of the weighted and unweighted data. Conclusions: Despite large variations in climate and soils between sites, there was still a separate and recognisable impact of management on the mean weighted traits of the vegetation. There was also a degree of shared variation between the three groups of factors, indicating that the response of plant traits to one group of factors may not be predictable because they may be modulated by their response to other groups. © 2009 International Association for Vegetation Science.",Disturbance; Environment-trait relationships; Land-use change; Variance partitioning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70249133649

Within highly modified European landscapes, limestone quarries can act as important secondary habitats for a range of endangered wild bee species. However, the relative influence of quarry habitat area, habitat age and within-habitat diversity on the conservation value of these secondary habitats is mainly unknown. 2. We assessed species richness and abundance of wild bees by variable transect walks in 24 limestone quarries ranging in size from 0.01 to 21.2 ha. Species traits such as social status, resource specialization and nesting substrate were used to define functional guilds of bees. 3. In total, 41% of all wild bee species known from southern Lower Saxony, Germany, were found in the studied quarries. Total species richness increased with habitat area but, in contrast to our expectations, not with habitat age, although we tested an age gradient of over 120 years. Solitary species were more strongly affected by decreasing habitat area than social species but response did not differ with respect to habitat age. 4. Hierarchical partitioning analyses revealed that habitat area per se, within-habitat diversity and sampling effort were of similar importance in explaining species richness patterns. 5. Synthesis and applications. Even newly created limestone quarries provide an important secondary habitat for wild bees. Therefore, maintenance and management of secondary succession of these sites should be given high priority in species conservation plans. Landscape management schemes involving filling or flooding such quarries should be prevented. © 2008 The Authors.",Apiformes; Conservation; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat heterogeneity; Habitat quality; Life-history traits; Pollinators; Secondary habitats; Species-area relationships; Succession,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249112277

Effects of fragmentation may vary with regard to life form and breeding system, and few studies exist for wind-pollinated trees. We examined the effects of hand-selfing, varying outcrossing distances and pollen addition on seed mass and germination rate of Polylepis australis BITT. (Rosaceae), a wind-pollinated treeline species endemic to Argentina. We also investigated pollen germination on the stigma and pollen tube growth to determine compatibility resulting from selfing and outcrossing. Selfing reduced seed germination rates with significant differences between open pollination and outcrosses at 30 km. In addition, we found a tendency for pollen germination and pollen tube growth to decrease following selfing. Between-fragment crosses resulted in a trend of higher reproductive output than within-fragment crosses, whereas values were similar between open pollination and between-fragment crosses. Pollen addition did not increase reproductive success neither in small nor in larger fragments. Our results suggest that highly isolated P. australis forests have a potential for inbreeding depression through selfing and within-fragment crosses. However, the results also indicate that pollen flow between P. australis forest fragments is still effective at the current fragmentation level, counteracting negative effects on seed quality resulting from reproductive isolation. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Central Argentina; Genetic incompatibility; Inbreeding depression; Outcrossing distances; Pollen addition; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649227532

Upon insertion of the gene trap construct into an expressed gene, splice donor and acceptor sites facilitate the generation of transcriptional fusions between the flanking sequence and the reporter. Consequently, detection of reporter gene expression allows the identification of genes based on their expression pattern. Up to now rice is the only cereal crop for which gene trap approaches exist. In this study we describe a gene trap system in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) based on the maize transposable elements Ac/Ds. Results: We generated gene trap barley lines by crossing Ac transposase expressing plants with multiple independent transformants carrying the Ds based gene trap construct GTDsB. Upstream of the ?-Glucuronidase start codon GTDsB carries splice donor and acceptor sites optimized for monocotyledonous plants. DNA blot analysis revealed GTDsB transposition frequencies of 11% and 26% in the F1 and F2 generation of gene trap lines and perpetuation of transposition activity in later generations. Furthermore, analysis of sequences flanking transposed GTDsB elements evidenced preferential insertion into expressed regions of the barley genome. We screened leaves, nodes, immature florets, pollinated florets, immature grains and seedlings of F2 plants and detected GUS expression in 51% (72/141) of the plants. Thus, reporter gene expression was found in 24 of the 28 F1 lines tested and in progeny of all GTDsB parental lines. Conclusion: Due to the frequent transposition of GTDsB and the efficient expression of the GUS reporter gene, we conclude that this Ac/Ds-based gene trap system is an applicable approach for gene discovery in barley. The successful introduction of a gene trap construct optimized for monocots in barley contributes a novel functional genomics tool for this cereal crop. © 2009 Lazarow and Lütticke; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449224743

We studied these effects on stage structure, recruitment, reproduction and offspring fitness in populations of the declining perennial grassland plant Trifolium montanum in central Germany. Density and survival probability of juvenile plants decreased with light competition, measured as leaf area index (LAI) above T. montanum plants, resulting in aged populations with few juvenile plants at unmanaged sites with higher LAI. Reproduction of T. montanum was not related to LAI, but increased strongly with local density, suggesting pollinator limitation in fragmented populations with a low density of flowering plants. In the common garden, the survival of sown offspring increased with mean seed size, whereas seed production of offspring decreased with isolation, and in strong contrast to previous studies, also decreased with size and density of the population of origin. This could be due to increased inbreeding because of pollination between closely related neighbouring plants in dense and large populations. Our results indicate that both habitat degradation and fragmentation have negative effects on populations of T. montanum, but affect different phases of the life cycle. In the short term, the effects of habitat degradation are more important than those of fragmentation, and populations of T. montanum are primarily threatened by an increase in light competition in unmanaged sites, which rapidly affects the dynamics of the populations. The observed opposite effects of habitat fragmentation on reproduction and offspring fitness indicate that the effects of population size, density and isolation on plant fitness and population viability may be complex. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Light competition; Local density; Management; Offspring fitness; Perennial plant; Population isolation; Population size; Recruitment; Reproduction; Stage structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649180655

Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of 'stabilizing mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate among three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly 'redundant' species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Cross-scale resilience; Density compensation; Numerical compensation; Redundancy; Response diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149269283

Recently, more detailed models have incorporated higher levels of constraint in order to reproduce the actual links observed in real food webs. Here, building on previous stochastic models of consumer-resource interactions between species, we propose a highly parsimonious model that can reproduce the overall bipartite structure of cooperative partner-partner interactions, as exemplified by plant-animal mutualistic networks. Our stochastic model of bipartite cooperation uses simple specialization and interaction rules, and only requires three empirical input parameters. We test the bipartite cooperation model on ten large pollination data sets that have been compiled in the literature, and find that it successfully replicates the degree distribution, nestedness and modularity of the empirical networks. These properties are regarded as key to understanding cooperation in mutualistic networks. We also apply our model to an extensive data set of two classes of company engaged in joint production in the garment industry. Using the same metrics, we find that the network of manufacturer-contractor interactions exhibits similar structural patterns to plant-animal pollination networks. This surprising correspondence between ecological and organizational networks suggests that the simple rules of cooperation that generate bipartite networks may be generic, and could prove relevant in many different domains, ranging from biological systems to human society. ©2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The anatomy of these bracts was studied to understand how such movements occur and how it influences reproductive ecology of the species. The involucral bracts have a single layered epidermis composed of thick-walled cells on the abaxial surface, which are responsible for the movement. Since they are hygroscopic, these cells swell when they absorb water from the surrounding environment, causing the bracts to bend and the capitula to close. In natural conditions, the capitula open by day, when temperature increases and the relative air humidity decreases, and close at night, when temperature decreases and the relative air humidity increases. The involucral bracts may thus protect the flowers from abiotic factors, exposing them only at the time of the day when temperature is higher and insects are more active, favoring pollination by small insects. The closed capitula do not only protect the flowers, but they also function as a shelter for floral visitors as Brachiacantha australe (Coccinellidae) and Eumolpini sp. (Chrysomelidae). These small Coleoptera pollinate the flowers of S. elegans during the day and remain within the closed capitula during the night, in a possible mutualistic relationship. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Removal of off-types in the field or seed lots increases costs of production. Information on level of out-crossing in cowpea and its insect pollinators as well as associated pollen movement would be useful in developing strategies to reduce outcrossing related problems. The objectives of this paper were to identify insect pollinators of cowpea, determine the level of outcrossing in the crop, and its implications in the deployment of genetically transformed cowpeas. Two experiments were conducted in Nigeria (IITA Ibadan and Mokwa) and Benin Republic (Cotonou) to assess geneflow frequency in cowpea under different planting arrangements. The first experiment was to quantify level of insect mediated out-crossing when three cowpea varieties (IT95K-1491, Sanzi, and IT86D-719) were respectively planted in alternate rows (one metre apart) with IT95K-1093-5. The second was to assess the level of insect mediated outcrossing when IT95K-1491, a breeding line with morphological marker (anthocyanin pigment), was planted in 3 - 4 concentric inner rows of 1 m apart while IT95K-1093-5 was planted in outer concentric rows up to 16 m from the epicenter. Incidence of insects visiting the plots was taken during the flowering stage of the crop. During harvesting, pods of IT95K-1093-5 were harvested from every plant within 3 - 4 m length along north, south, west and east axes of each concentric circle. In the case of alternate row planting, pods from single plants were harvested from rows of IT95K-1093-5 of each pair. Seeds derived from these plants (IT95K-1093-5) were planted in the field in order to assess the level of outcrossing that resulted from the movement of pollens from IT95K-1491, Sanzi, and IT86D-719 onto IT95K-1093-5 in the case of alternate row planting and IT95K-1491 onto IT95K-1093-5 for the concentric planting. Percentage of hybrids bearing the morphological trait of the marker parent was determined. Results obtained showed that level of out crossing was higher (0.5 to 0.85%) when cowpea was planted in alternate rows than in concentric rows (0.01 to 0.13%). Outcrossing was found to have occurred in a random fashion beyond 13 m.

The populations were compared based on phenotypic variation of cones, seeds, seed-wings, juvenile seedlings and seedlings morphology, to study the pattern of natural variation of the species. ANOVA and Duncan test showed that the morphological characters differed by populations. Also, the cluster modeling performed on the morphological characters suggested that altitude was a major factor to differentiate the groups.

We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to 153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between 190 and 310 billion based upon average price elasticities of - 1.5 to - 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about 50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged 151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged 761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, interspecific crossability barrier, a critical bottleneck restricting genes transfer from O. meyeriana to cultivars has led to no hybrids through conventional reproduction. Therefore, the reasons underlying incrossability were investigated in the present report. The results showed that: (i) at 3-7d after pollination (DAP), many hybrid embryos degenerated at the earlier globular-shaped stage, and could not develop into the later pear-shaped stage. Meanwhile, free endosperm nuclei started to degenerate at 1 DAP, and cellular endosperm could not form at 3 DAP, leading to nutrition starvation for young embryo development; (ii) at 11-13 DAP, almost all hybrid ovaries aborted. Even though 72.22% of hybrid young embryos were produced in the interspecific hybridization between O. sativa and O. meyeriana, young embryos were not able to further develop into hybrid plantlets via culturing in vitro. The main reason for the incrossability was hybrid embryo inviability, presenting as embryo development stagnation and degeneration since 3 DAP. Some possible approaches to overcome the crossability barriers in the interspecific hybridization between O. sativa and O. meyeriana are discussed. © 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Crossability; Embryo development; Inter specific hybridization; O. meyeriana; Oryza sativa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149345984

To clarify the causal mechanism of embryo sac abortion, we studied the female gametophyte development in two indica/ japonica hybrids via an eosin B staining procedure for embryo sac scanning using confocal laser scanning microscope. Different types of abnormalities occurred during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis were demonstrated. The earliest abnormality was observed in the megasporocyte. A lot of the chalazal-most megaspores were degenerated before the mono-nucleate embryo sac stage. Disordered positioning of nucleus and abnormal nucellus tissue were characteristics of the abnormal female gametes from the mono-nucleate to four-nucleate embryo sac stages. The abnormalities that occurred from the early stage of the eight-nucleate embryo sac development to the mature embryo sac stage were characterized by smaller sizes and wrinkled antipodals. Asynchronous nuclear migration, abnormal positioning of nucleus, and degeneration of egg apparatus were also found at the eight-nucleate embryo sac stage. The abnormalities that occurred during female gametophyte development resulted in five major types of abnormal embryo sacs. These abnormal embryo sacs led to abnormal fertilization.

In quantitative genetics, single parent-offspring regression is the most straightforward method in situations where the progenies are produced by cross-pollination to many male parents of unknown location. However, estimation of the heritability of gene expression with single parent-offspring regression has not yet been examined with 2-channel microarrays. Here we introduce 3 experimental designs: chain design, independent quartets design, and completely independent design. We then compare them with common reference design in respect to statistical power and bias of the estimates. In our simulations, we also incorporated a model of simple inheritance with one gene. The results of our simulations indicate the efficiency of the chain design over the alternative design considered. © The American Genetic Association. 2008.

For this purpose, 305 seedlings collected in 2 years at 2 locations in France from 4 wild female individuals and 417 wild individuals prospected from France and Italy were analyzed using 20 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. Their profiles were compared with a database consisting of 3203 accessions from the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique Vassal collection including cultivars, rootstocks, interspecific hybrids, and other wild individuals. Paternity was assigned for 202 (66.2%) of the 305 seedlings, confirming the feasibility of the method. Most of the fertilizing pollen could be assigned to wild males growing nearby. Estimates of pollen immigration from the cultivated compartment (i.e., the totality of cultivars) ranged from 4.2% to 26% from nearby vineyards and from hidden pollinators such as cultivars and rootstocks that had escaped from farms. In an open landscape, the pollen flow was correlated to the distance between individuals, the main pollinator being the closest wild male (accounting for 51.4-86.2% of the pollen flow). In a closed landscape, more complex pollination occurred. Analysis of the parentage of the 417 wild individuals also revealed relationships between nearby wild individuals, but in the case of 12 individuals (3%), analysis revealed pollen immigration from vineyards, confirming the fitness of the hybrid seedlings. These pollen fluxes may have a significant effect on the evolution of wild populations: on the one hand, the low level of pollen-mediated gene flow from cultivated to wild grapevine could contribute to a risk of extinction of the wild compartment (i.e., the totality of the wild individuals). On the other hand, pollen dispersal within the wild populations may induce inbreeding depression of wild grapevines. © The American Genetic Association. 2008.

Most of the individuals in the extant populations normally bear flowers, but fruit set and fertile seed production rates were only 6.7% and 0.2%, respectively. To identify possible causes of reproductive barriers, the following studies were carried out: examination of stamen and pistil development; experiments using controlled pollination; observations of behavior and frequency of floral visitors in both cultivated and natural populations. The results revealed that about 60% of pollen was abnormal and approx. 70% of ovules had delayed development. Hand pollination could effectively enhance the fruit set (F4,25=35.139, P&lt;0.0001) and seed set per fruit (F4,25=85.022, P&lt;0.0001). Both cultivated and wild M. coriacea had an extremely low frequency of floral visitors. Some beetles, a few species of Andrenidae and some Bombus sp. are likely to be the effective pollinators. The fruit set and seed set per fruit from controlled self-pollination and cross-pollination were significantly different (P&lt;0.05), and thus it is inferred, that inbreeding depression may be a contributing factor in the very low seed production. It appears that low seed set in M. coriacea is due to a combination of factors: abnormalities in pollen and ovules, low number of effective pollinators, and inbreeding depression. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Although iridescence might be expected to increase attractiveness, it might also compromise target identification because the object's appearance will vary depending on the viewer's perspective.

In a recent article, we compared 45 year series (1961-2006) in yield, production and cultivated area of pollinator-dependent and nondependent crop around the world. If pollinator shortage is occurring globally, we expected a lower annual growth rate in yield for pollinator-dependent than nondependent crops, but a higher growth in cultivated area to compensate the lower yield. We have found little evidence for the first ""yield"" prediction but strong evidence for the second ""area"" prediction. Here, we present an additional analysis to show that the first and second predictions are both supported for crops that vary in dependency levels from nondependent to moderate dependence (i.e., up to 65% average yield reduction without pollinators). However, those crops for which animal pollination is essential (i.e., 95% average yield reduction without pollinators) showed higher growth in yield and lower expansion in area than expected in a pollination shortage scenario.

We assessed the effect of small-scale disturbance on local richness, abundance, diversity and evenness of insect pollinator fauna; and how habitat disturbance affected species turnover across the landscape and overall diversity along a precipitation gradient in NW Patagonia (Argentina). We evaluated the effect of disturbance on overall pollinator fauna and then separately for bees (i. e. Apoidea) and non-bee pollinators. Locally, disturbed habitats had significantly higher pollinator species richness and abundances than undisturbed habitats for the whole pollinator assemblage, but not for bees or non-bees separately. However, significant differences in species richness between habitats vanished after accounting for differences in abundance between habitat types. At a local scale Shannon-Weaver diversity and evenness did not vary with disturbance. A ? diversity index indicated that, across forest types, species turnover was lower between disturbed habitats than between undisturbed habitats. In addition, rarefaction curves showed that disturbed habitats as a whole accumulated fewer species than undisturbed habitats at equivalent sample sizes. We concluded that small patches of disturbed habitat have a negligible effect on local pollinator diversity; however, habitat disturbance reduced ? diversity through a homogenization of the pollinator fauna (in particular of bees) across the landscape. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",?

Pollination of the nectarless flowers of Pedicularis species depends on bumblebee workers collecting pollen by vibrating the anthers (buzz pollination). However, little is known about the efficiency of the pollination system. Foraging behavior, pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas of P. chamissonis were studied to assess the effectiveness of buzz pollination in an alpine snowbed population of northern Japan. Although bumblebees tended to visit most of the flowers open at a given time within inflorescences during a single visit, pollen removal rate at the first visit was about 20%, and buzzing period decreased with increasing number of previous visits, resulting in a decreasing proportion of pollen removed per visit as the number of visits increased. These trends enable plants to provide pollen for more pollinators. The number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas was not saturated during the first visit and increased with additional visits. Irrespective of weak self-compatibility, evidence of interference between self and outcross pollen was lacking for seed production. Therefore, buzz pollination in P. chamissonis acts as a mechanism that improves the chance of cross-pollination upon multiple visits if pollinator visitation is frequent. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Bombus; Buzz pollination; Pedicularis chamissonis; Pollen deposition; Pollen removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62349107785

Meiosis of a single archesporocyte originates linear megasporic tetrads with chalazal viability. The megagametophyte belongs to the Polygonum type. Porogamous fertilisation occurs prior to perianth opening. From the apical proembryonal cell ca the rudimentary coiled embryo proper originates, formed mostly by the hypocotyl. A broad suspensor is derived from the frequently vesicular basal cell cb. The haustorial nuclear endosperm becomes divided into cells in a centripetal way. The central cellular endosperm becomes reabsorbed. The probable post-hydration expansion of both a gelatinised remaining endosperm and a scanty tegumentary parenchyma could help fracturing the exotestic seed-cover during germination. At the three-layered testa hydrochoric adaptations have been observed and deemed as related to wetland habitats of such species. Our results suggest that in predominantly cleistogamous populations of C. obtusiflora, gene flow is likely performed through hydrochoric seed dispersal. Preanthesis cleistogamy is likely to increase reproductive performance of this species. Such a pollination system is firstly evidenced in parasitic plants in the present report. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile","Pollination is a requisite for sexual reproduction in plants and its success may determine the reproductive output of individuals. Pollinator preference for some floral designs or displays that are lacking or poorly developed in focal plants may constrain the pollination process. Foliar herbivory may affect the expression of floral traits, thus reducing pollinator attraction. Natural populations of the Andean species Alstroemeria exerens (Alstromeriaceae) in central Chile show high levels of foliar herbivory, and floral traits show phenotypic variation. In the present field study, we addressed the attractive role of floral traits in A. exerens and the effect of foliar damage on them. Particularly, we posed the following questions: (1) Is there an association between floral display and design traits and the number and duration of pollinator visits? and (2) Does foliar damage affect the floral traits associated with pollinator visitation? To assess the attractiveness of floral traits for pollinators, we recorded the number and duration of visits in 101 focal plants. To evaluate the effects of foliar damage on floral traits, 100 plants of similar size were randomly assigned to control or damage groups during early bud development. Damaged plants were clipped using scissors (50% of leaf area) and control plants were manually excluded from natural herbivores (<5% of leaf area eaten). During the peak of flowering, we recorded the number of open flowers, and estimated corolla and nectar guide areas. The number and duration of pollinator visits was statistically associated with floral design and display traits. Plants with larger displays, corollas and nectar guide areas received more visits. Visits lasted longer as display increases. In addition, foliar damage affected attractive traits. Damaged plants had fewer open flowers and smaller nectar guide areas. We conclude that foliar damage affects plant attractiveness for pollinators and hence may indirectly affect plant fitness. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Floral traits; Herbivory; Indirect effects; Plant-animal interaction; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349654134

However, the high costs involved and relatively low seed yields often obtained has, in most cases, necessitated the use of lower quality, open pollinated seed. The aim of the present study was to compare control-pollination methods for combinations among small-flowered eucalypt species. By making crosses within and among Eucalyptus grandis, E. smithii and E. macarthurii, we compared effectiveness, in terms of seed production and level of genetic contamination, of three CP techniques, namely emasculation of bagged flowers and subsequent pollination of receptive stigmas (Conventional method), emasculation and immediate pollination of stigmas with induced receptivity followed by bagging (One Stop Pollination), and pollination of cut styles without emasculation and bagging (Artificially Induced Protogyny). One tree of each species was used as the female in these crosses. Although Artificially Induced Protogyny using ripe and semi-ripe buds produced the highest seeds/flower pollinated in the majority of crosses carried out in this study, the technique, when performed on green buds, resulted in the highest capsule abortion. Molecular analysis using microsatellite markers also revealed that progeny from the Artificially Induced Protogyny method, when using green and semi-ripe buds, were highly contaminated by self- and external pollen. Of the three CP-techniques tested, One Stop Pollination had the lowest genetic contamination. However, this technique also had one of the lowest seed yields, while the Conventional method was intermediate in performance. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Artificially Induced Protogyny; Controlled pollination; Eucalyptus; Interspecific; Intraspecific; One Stop Pollination; Open pollination; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71249111903

The flowers are visited by females of Allograpta javana and Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae) that disperse the orchid's massulate pollen onto the receptive stigmas. Measurements of insect bodies and floral architecture show that the physical dimensions of these two fly species correlate with the relative positions of the receptive stigma and dehiscent anthers of P. barbigerum. These hoverflies land on the slippery centralised wart located on the shiny yellow staminode and then fall backwards through the labellum entrance.

The greatest pollination success occurred after hand-crossed (76.6%), open (54.4%) and emasculation pollination (53.3%). Consistently, hand-crossed (12.2%), emasculation (8.7%) and open pollination (5.1%) yielded a substantial fruit set 2 mo after the pollination experiments. Very low pollination success in facilitated autogamy suggests that most durian trees are highly self incompatible. No mature fruit was found after insect pollination and automatic autogamy. Fruit bats, especially Eonycteris spelaea, are the major pollinators of this durian although the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the most frequent visitor to the flowers. Bats visited durian flowers at the rate of 26.1 (SD = 20.7) visits per inflorescence per night. Since this semi-wild durian depends on fruit bats as its pollinator, protecting fruit bat populations and their roosts is vital for the production of the durian fruit crop. © 2008 Copyright Cambridge University Press.",Durian; Eonycteris spelaea; Giant honey bee; Insect pollination; Mixed-fruit orchard; Self-incompatibility; Thailand,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649188214

Here we review mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of floral isolation in various pollination systems. Furthermore, we compare key features of floral isolation, i.e., pollinator sharing and specialization in pollination, in different orchid pollination systems. In orchid pollination, pollinator sharing is generally low, indicating strong floral isolation. The pollinators' motivation to visit flowers (specifically) can be due to both foraging or reproductive behavior. In both types of behavior, innate preferences for floral signals can be quickly overruled by learning. In pollination systems in which reproductive behavior of pollinators triggers flower visits, lower pollinator sharing was evident compared with systems with foraging behavior, probably because pollinators displaying reproductive behavior show higher fidelity in their visitation patterns. Orchids pollinated through reproductive behavior also use fewer pollinators than orchids pollinated through foraging behavior. No association between specialization and pollinator sharing was found. Thus, generalized pollination does not impede floral isolation, as orchids with many pollinators may nonetheless have low pollinator sharing. Specialization in pollination was, however, linked to orchid species richness in our analysis. Flower size, spur, and column morphology are most important for morphological isolation, and floral scent is most important for ethological isolation. These traits may be based on few genes, implying that floral isolation can be brought about by few genes of large effect. Copyright © 2009 by Annual Reviews.

Pollination service in agroecosystems depends on several factors, including the land management systems used by farmers. Here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of management systems in central Veracruz, Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact management systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high environmental impact management systems (the native forest is completely removed). We hypothesized that pollinator diversity should be higher in low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems should display higher fruit production than plantations with high-impact management systems. We used observational and experimental data to test this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management systems have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index) of pollinators than high-impact management systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively related with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover, fruit production was higher in low-impact than in high-impact management systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that such effects may have strong consequences on coffee fruit production. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To testify that the grain yield increase might be a result of improved photosynthetic rate and related traits, the normal oil maize (NOM) hybrid, Nongda108, was cross-pollinated by three HOM hybrids, HOM202, HOM115 and HOM4515 (for short as ND108pHOM202, ND108pHOM115 and ND108pHOM4515). We found that the ND108pHOM202 and ND108pHOM115 exhibited higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn), accompanied by larger stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E). Moreover, delayed leaf senescence was observed in their leaves, including larger leaf area index (LAI) and higher Chl content and Chl a/b ratio. Apart from higher phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) activity, the soluble proteins were also higher in the two cross-pollinations. The higher leaf photosynthesis could explain the grain increase in ND108pHOM202 and ND108pHOM115. However, ND108pHOM4515 exhibited a decreased photosynthetic characteristic and yield performance. Significantly positive relation between grain yield and biomass (r2 = 0.96, P &lt; 0.05), Pn and biomass (r2 = 0.74, P &lt; 0.05) also suggested that the yield increase in the two cross-pollination treatments was generally owing to the higher photosynthetic rate and related photosynthetic traits. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To date, only one pollination study of the genus has reported brood-site pollination by thrips in M. hullettii. In this study, the pollination system of Macaranga tanarius is reported.  Methods: The study was conducted on Okinawa and Amami Islands, Japan. Flower visitors on M. tanarius were collected and their pollen load and behaviour on the flowers examined, as well as inflorescence structure and reward for the pollinators.  Key Results: The most abundant flower visitors found on the male and female inflorescences were Orius atratus (Anthocoridae, Hemiptera), followed by Decomioides schneirlai (Miridae, Hemiptera). Pollen load on O. atratus from flowering pistillate inflorescences was detected as well as from staminate flowers. Orius atratus and D. schneirlai are likely to use the enclosed chambers formed by floral bracts as breeding sites before and during flower anthesis, and feed on nectar on the adaxial surface of flower bracts. The extrafloral nectary has a ball-shaped structure and the contained nectar is not exposed; the hemipterans pierce the ball to suck out the nectar.  Conclusions: The results indicate that the plant is pollinated by flower bugs breeding on the inflorescences. This study may be the first report of pollination systems in which flower bugs are the main pollinators. Similarity of pollination systems between M. hullettii and M. tanarius indicates that the two brood-site pollination systems have the same origin. The pollinator species belongs to a predacious group, whose major prey includes thrips. The pollination system might represent a unique example of evolution from predatory flower visitors feeding on the pollinators (thrips) to the main pollinators. © The Author 2008.

Recently, unusual fermentation odors have been described in the nectar and flowers of some species. Since yeasts are common inhabitants of many angiosperms nectars, this raises the possibility that nectar yeasts may act as causal agents of fermentation odors in flowers and, therefore, as possible intermediate agents in plant signaling to pollinators. A recent field study has reported that nectar yeasts were quite frequent in floral nectar across three different regions in Europe and America, where they reached high densities (up to 10(5) cells/mm(3)). Yeast incidence in floral nectar differed widely across plant host species in all sampling sites. A detailed study currently in progress on one of the species surveyed in that study (Helleborus foetidus, Ranunculaceae) has detected that, in addition to interespecific differences in yeast incidence, there is also a strong component of variance in yeast abundance that takes place at the subindividual level (among flowers of the same plant, among nectaries of the same flower). If yeast metabolism is eventually proved to contribute significantly to floral scent, then multilevel patchiness in the distribution of nectar yeasts (among species, among individuals within species, and among flowers and nectaries of the same individual) might contribute to concomitant multilevel variation in plant signaling and, eventually, also in pollination success, pollen flow and plant fitness.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954064291

Carex, a large genus of anemophilous herbs, is predominantly monoecious and many species are protogynous. We investigated whether monoecy and protogyny limit self-pollination in seven Carex species.  We conducted field experiments comparing stigmatic pollen loads and seed set between intact and emasculated stems. We tested for self-compatibility and evaluated pollen limitation of seed set by supplemental pollination. Finally, we measured outcrossing rates in open-pollinated and emasculated stems using allozyme markers.  Emasculated stems captured significantly less pollen than open-pollinated stems and set less seed. Pollen deposition during the female-only phase for intact stems was only 12% of the total captured. Outcrossing rates for three species indicated high selfing (range t = 0.03-0.39). Allozyme loci in the remaining species were monomorphic also suggesting high selfing. These results demonstrate that neither monoecy nor protogyny is particularly effective at limiting self-fertilization.  Selection for the avoidance of selfing is unlikely to maintain monoecy in many Carex species although protogyny may provide limited opportunities for outcrossing.

Since habitat fragmentation acts both on pollinator behaviour and plant reproduction, its consequences for the stability of such interactions are complex. An extreme case of habitat fragmentation occurs in urbanised areas where suitable habitat (in the present study small patches around ornamental trees) is embedded in a highly unsuitable environment (concrete matrix). Based on simple experiments, we ask whether pollinators can adapt their foraging behaviour in response to the amount of available resources (flowers) in the fragments and their isolation, as predicted by the optimal foraging theory. To do so we analysed the effect of fragmentation on the behaviour of pollinators visiting Crepis sancta (L.) Bornm. (Asteraceae), which forms large populations in the countryside and patchy populations in urban environments. More precisely we studied pollinator visitation rates, capitulum visit durations, capitulum search durations and capitulum size choice. Pollinators chose larger capitula in both types of populations and their foraging behaviour differed between the two population types in three ways: (1) pollinator visits were lower in urban fragmented populations, perhaps due to the lower accessibility of urban patches; (2) capitulum visit durations were longer in urban fragmented populations, a possible compensation of energy lost during flights among patches; and (3) capitulum search durations where longer in urban fragmented populations, which may represent an increase in capitulum prospecting effort. We discuss the possible impacts of such differences for plant population functioning in the two types of populations. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

First, to account for the main floral reward (i.e., nectar), the relationship between the dimensions of the nectar gland and nectar production was investigated. Second, floral traits variation was assessed within and between the three most representative populations of the species. Finally, the role of several floral traits in the female fitness was evaluated. Furthermore, as nectar robbing was highly frequent, preferences of robbers for specific floral traits and their impact on legitimate pollinations were also evaluated. The flowers of this species are characterized by significant variations in floral characteristics and nectar rewards. A significant and positive correlation between the nectar gland dimensions and nectar production per flower was observed, with the gland dimensions being a good measure to infer the rewards offered by the flowers of P. vayredae. In general, corolla traits were significant and positively correlated with each other. Nectar was revealed to be an important trait in flower-visitor interactions, with legitimate pollinations being primarily influenced by this floral reward.

Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland. However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed frequently, performing 73% of detected flower visits. Conversely, nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11% of visits. Fruit bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less than 2% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301 seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queenslands native forests showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly outcrossing (tm=0.899 ± 0.021). Preferential effective pollination from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood paternity analysis with up to 16% of reproduction events resulting from selfing. Forty to 48% of fertilising pollen was also carried from longer distance (&gt;60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in potential long-distance pollinations. © NISC Pty Ltd.",Contemporary gene flow; Corymbia; Eucalypt; Mating system; Pollinator visitation; Reproductive biology; Spotted gums,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862210471

Fleming) is a high value medicinal plant due the presence of various alkaloids used in different medicinal purposes. It is already declared as one of the critically endangered plants in the whole world. Its slow rate of seed germination also triggers the problem of danger of its near extinction. In view of that, cytological study and bagging experiment in the field were done in order to find the nature of pollination. Whole set of experiments were carried out in the year 2007 to understand its reproductive biology, floral biology and breeding behaviour. Flowers were taken as unopened and opened form for the experiment from different plants and pollen viability study was done at the laboratory to observe its different chromosomal stages. One observation clearly shows matured pollen having long pollen tube configuration along with distinct vegetative nucleus in the proximity of the pollen cell. It represents self pollination because pollens along with stigma were taken specifically from an unopened flower for the purpose of finding the nature of pollination. Bagging experiments were taken in conjunction with the cytological study on different parameters, where treatments like controlled self-pollination, bagging in immature flower buds and flowers left without any treatment (open pollination) showed maximum seed setting and statistically non significant results between them. They also showed highly significant results (P<0.05) and more than four fold increase in seed setting than controlled cross and open cross treatments. These findings are completely new from the point of view of field experiments. Earlier morphological evidences represented cross pollination, now it is confirmed and declared that the probable mode of pollination is self pollination. It directly contradicts the earlier reports and chances of cross pollination vary only between 16- 20% found from the evidences in this investigation. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bagging experiment; Breeding behaviour; Chirayita; Chromosomal stages; Controlled self pollination; Pollen tube formation; Unopened flower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70249130908

Although there is an international initiative for its conservation, there is a lack of studies on the reproductive biology of the species, as for the genus, a fundamental understanding for the conservation of any species. In this paper, we investigated the phenology, pollination, and breeding system of C. echinata, presenting some conservation guidelines for the species, together with a review of studies on the reproductive biology in Caesalpinia s.l. The genus has a complex taxonomic history with recent attempts to reassign its limits. Pending a final resolution of the placing of some species (including C. echinata) our revision covers the traditional Caesalpinia s.l. and includes annotations indicating to which segregate genus each species is now considered to belong, as well as the appropriate combination where this has already been published. Field work was undertaken from October/2004 to December/2006 at the Tapacurá Ecological Station, northeastern Brazil. Flowering occurred mainly in the dry season and the peak of seed dispersal was at the beginning of the wet season. Anthesis is diurnal, lasting 1 day. The flowers are zygomorphic, yellow, sweet-scented, and the effective pollinators were mainly medium-sized to large bees of the genera Centris and Xylocopa, together with the introduced Apis mellifera. Nectar volume and sugar concentration averaged 2.9±1.0 ?L and 29.5±9.4%, respectively. The ovary has 1-4 ovules (2.35±0.58) and the pollen/ovule ratio was 5631.2; pollen viability was high (95.9±4.8%). Natural fruit set was low (9.2%) with mature fruits averaging 1.7±0.9 seeds. Results of the controlled pollinations and analysis of pollen tube growth revealed C. echinata presents late-acting self-incompatibility. The pollination biology and breeding system of C. echinata are discussed, together with available data on its genetics and physiology, in terms of best conservation practice for this endangered species. Data on the reproductive biology of the genus are scarce, revealing the predominance of bee pollination and SI system, with the occurrence of late-acting self-incompatibility mechanisms in some species. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Controlled pollination experiments in a South African plantation of J curcas showed that plants required pollinator visits for seed production and were genetically self-compatible. Pollen-supplementation did not lead to increased fruit set, suggesting that seed production in the study population was not pollen-limited. Both male and female flowers produced nectar and were highly attractive to honeybees. These insects were effective pollinators of J curcas, as shown by experiments in which flowers exposed to single or multiple visits by honeybees set significantly more fruit than those from which visits had been prevented. Self-pollination led to marginally lower levels of fruit set relative to cross-pollination. However, fruits arising from self-pollination were almost as numerous and as large as those arising from cross-pollination. Progeny from selfed plants had significantly shorter roots than the progeny of out-crossed plants. However, in general, there was little evidence of inbreeding depression.

This is a recessive trait, regarded to be controlled by a single locus, namely, the AST locus, which has a polysomic nature. Thus far, we have identified 2 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, namely, Al and A2, each of which is separately linked to a different AST allele, and proved that the RFLP markers were useful for selecting PCNA-type persimmons. This study was conducted to convert the RFLP markers into polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers. We isolated and characterized genomic regions corresponding to each RFLP marker by inverse PCR. Two primer pairs, E4/E9r and E4/A2r, were designed to generate 2 sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, i.e., PCR-A1 and PCR-A2, respectively. The PCR-A1 and PCR-A2 markers cosegregated with the Al and A2 markers, respectively, in 'Nishimura-wase'-derived progenies. Although the primer pair E4/A2r did not produce the PCR-A2 marker in the FU-275, which is a progeny derived from 'Aizumishirazu', all non-PCNA-type offspring but no PCNA-type offspring showed the PCR-A1 marker using the primer pair E4/E9r. Thus, it was revealed that the SCAR markers were useful for selecting PCNA-type offspring in these progenies. On the other hand, disruption of the relationship between the markers and the AST locus was observed in the KU-325, derived from 'Kurokuma', indicating that the selection of PCNA-type offspring using PCR-based markers is not effective for progeny derived from 'Kurokuma'.

The results of this experiment showed that V. villosa flowers were very attractive to worker honeybees as well as to few numbers of wild bees. The most frequent visitor species were A. mellifera and Anthophora albigena of family Apidae. V. villosa flowers attracted most of the bee visitors in the early hours of the day. The duration of their visit on the flowers also peaked early in the day and decreased toward the end of the day. The percentage of pod set of the un-covered plants averaged 14% out of the total florets on the plants, which was significantly higher than the covered plants (2%). These results indicated that the percentage of flower abscission was high and averaged more than 86%.

(Gentianaceae) is a long-lived perennial mountain species. It is a typical east-Alpine element. The centre of its distribution is situated in the eastern Alps, where the species occurs in alpine and subalpine areas. Besides the Alps, G. pannonica occurs also in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. The reproduction strategy and genetic variation of this species endangered in the Czech Republic were studied. Genetic variation within and among six populations of G. pannonica in the Bohemian Forest and two populations in the Alps was studied using random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPD) markers. The variation found between populations from primary habitats and populations situated in the secondary mountain meadows accounted for 5% of the total genetic variation, whereas no significant genetic diversity was found between two different regions (Bohemian Forest, the Alps). Most of the variation is distributed among individuals within populations in the primary habitats, specifically 77% in the Bohemian Forest and 79% in the Alps. The pattern of among-population variation was substantially different between primary and secondary habitats. While among-population variation in primary habitats was low in both of the regions (21-23%), the proportion of RAPD variation among populations in secondary habitats was distinctly higher (65%). Within-population genetic variation was higher in primary habitats than in the secondary ones. This may be a consequence of processes such as genetic drift or bottleneck, and founder effects caused by changes in their distribution during the Holocene period. The differences of vegetation composition, seedlings recruitment and seed set were investigated in the field. Vegetation composition differed between primary and secondary habitats of G. pannonica and seedlings recruitment was recorded only in primary habitats. The reproduction output of the species under study is probably influenced by the availability of pollinators. © 2008.",Bohemian forest; RAPD; Refugia; Secondary habitats; Seedlings; The Alps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58949084606

The Marchel site was an area with an approximate radius of 250 m in a large continuous stand growing in a mesic habitat in western Oregon. In contrast, the Vinson site was an area with a radius of approximately 10 km and consisted of small, disjunct and isolated stands in the high desert of eastern Oregon. Pollen immigration was extensive in both populations, and was higher in the Marchel site (0.54 ± 0.02) than in the substantially larger and more isolated Vinson site (0.32 ± 0.02). Pollen pool differentiation among mothers was approximately five times stronger in the Vinson population (?FT = 0.253, N = 27 mothers) than in the Marchel population (?FT = 0.052, N = 5 mothers). Pollen dispersal was modelled using a mixed dispersal curve that incorporated pollen immigration. Predicted pollination frequencies generated based on this curve were substantially more accurate than those based on the widely used exponential power dispersal curve. Male neighbourhood sizes (sensu Wright 1946) estimated using paternity analysis and pollen pool differentiation were remarkably similar. They were three to five times smaller in the Vinson population, which reflected the substantial ecological and demographic differences between the two populations. When the same mathematical function was used, applying direct and indirect methods resulted in similar pollen dispersal curves, thus confirming the value of indirect methods as a viable lower-cost alternative to paternity analysis. © 2008 The Authors.",Black cottonwood; Correlated paternity; Gene flow; Microsatellites; Parentage analysis; Populus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249141148

Here we document the effects of inbreeding and maternal family on volatile production by horsenettle Solanum carolinense L. (Solanaceae). We collected volatiles from ramets (clones) of each of 12 genets (genotypes) of horsenettle grown in four agricultural fields with natural levels of herbivory. The 12 genets included self- and cross-pollinated progeny from six maternal plants. We found that inbreeding reduced total volatile production relative to that of outcrossed plants. We also found a breeding-by-family interaction for the total amount and blend of volatiles, indicating genetic variation among families for inbreeding depression. Analysis of outcrossed plants alone (a random sample from the population) revealed a genet effect on the total amount and blend of volatiles released, indicating broad-sense heritability of volatile traits. Our findings offer insight into the consequences of inbreeding on volatile production and the variation in volatile cues available to foraging insects in a wild plant system. Moreover, we believe this to be the first study demonstrating genetic variation for plant volatiles in a noncultivated species under field conditions. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Location: The regular sampling grid comprised the whole range of the European Alps and the Carpathians. Methods: Twenty-two high-mountain plant species were exhaustively sampled and their genetic diversity was assessed with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). ANOVAs were used to check for relationships between species traits and species genetic diversity, and to test whether genetic diversity was influenced by altitude and phylogeographical history (i.e. Alps versus Carpathians). Results: In both mountain systems, species dispersed and pollinated by wind showed higher genetic diversity than species with self or insect pollination, and with animal- or gravity-dispersed seeds. Only in the Alps did altitudinal range size affect species genetic diversity significantly: species with narrow altitudinal ranges in the highest vegetation belts had significantly higher genetic diversity than those expanding over wide altitudinal ranges. Genetic diversity was species specific and significantly higher in the Alps than in the Carpathians, but it was not influenced by elevation. Main conclusions: Wind pollination and wind dispersal seem to foster high genetic diversity. However, species traits are often associated and their effects on genetic diversity cannot be clearly disentangled. As genetic diversity is species specific, comparisons across species need to be interpreted with care. Genetic diversity was generally lower in the Carpathians than in the Alps, due to higher topographical isolation of alpine habitats in the Carpathians and this mountain massif's divergent phylogeographical history. Elevation did not influence genetic diversity, challenging the long-held view of decreasing genetic diversity with increasing elevation in mountain plants. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.",AFLPs; Alpine plants; Alps; Carpathians; Elevation; Genetic diversity; Nei's gene diversity; Phylogeographical history; Quaternary glaciations; Range-wide sampling grid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649193401

Some of these new theories concern speciation driven by conflicts between the sexes. Even though it is well known that the two reproductive functions in plants can have different selective optima, sexual selection in plants is by many assumed to be weak or non-existent. Here we outline potential sexual conflicts in plants and discuss how selection pressures generated by such conflicts may influence genetic divergence. There is opportunity for conflicting selection pressures between individuals, such as manipulative pollen traits that enhance male reproductive success at the expense of the female reproductive function. Within individual plants, fitness of the male function (pollen export) and fitness of the female function (pollen import) may be optimised by different traits, leading to conflicting selection pressures in relation to pollen transfer. This may affect selection for floral specialisation versus floral generalisation in animal-pollinated species. We believe that selection pressures generated by sexual conflict need to be appreciated in order to fully understand microevolutionary processes which may lead to genetic divergence and speciation in plants. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Pollen competition; Pollination; Reproductive isolation; Sexual conflicts; Specialisation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58349094626

After mechanical stimulation, deposition of pollen from other plant species, of dead con-specific pollen or of sand, the stigma lobes opened again after 38 to 68 min.

A number of equally plausible hypotheses have been advanced in response to this question, among which the most widely accepted highlights the mutually beneficial animal-plant relationships that are nowhere better developed nor more widespread than among angiosperm species and their biotic vectors for pollination and dispersal. Nevertheless, consensus acknowledges that there are many other attributes unique to or characteristic of the flowering plants. In addition, the remarkable coevolution of the angiosperms and pollination/dispersal animal agents could be an effect of the intrinsic adaptability of the flowering plants rather than a primary cause of their success, suggesting that the search for underlying causes should focus on an exploration of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that might facilitate adaptive evolution and speciation. Here, we explore angiosperm diversity promoting attributes in their general form and draw particular attention to those that, either individually or collectively, have been shown empirically to favor high speciation rates, low extinction rates, or broad ecological tolerances. Among these are the annual growth form, homeotic gene effects, asexual/sexual reproduction, a propensity for hybrid polyploidy, and apparent ""resistance"" to extinction. Our survey of the literature suggests that no single vegetative, reproductive, or ecological feature taken in isolation can account for the evolutionary success of the angiosperms. Rather, we believe that the answer to Darwin's second ""abominable mystery"" lies in a confluence of features that collectively make the angiosperms unique among the land plants.",Agamospermy; Angiosperm diversification; Annual growth form; Floral trait evolution; Homeotic genes; Polyploidy; Species morphospace,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60249100398

Plants were bagged for either 12 h during the day or at night to allow either only nocturnal or only diurnal visitors to forage throughout the flowering period. We found that there was no significant difference in the seed:ovule ratio among diurnally pollinated, nocturnally pollinated, or control flowers. However, in terms of male reproductive success, it was more advantageous for the plants to be pollinated both diurnally and nocturnally: the numbers of pollen grains remaining in diurnally pollinated or nocturnally pollinated flowers were significantly greater than those in control flowers. The total amount of floral volatiles of L. auratum was significantly higher at night than during the day. The constituents of floral scent of all time series examined were mostly monoterpenoids, many of which serve as attractants for nocturnal hawkmoths.

These species are divided into six groups of which the lip morphology probably represents different forms of attracting and rewarding pollinators. Group one consists of Disticholiparis gregaria and Platystyliparis aurita with characteristic globular nectary and pad-like callus. The second group with Liparis nervosa has two conelike convexities. The third one is represented by Liparis sutupensis with spread lip, the basal callus, and the epichile often eroding with age. The fourth group (Stichorkis cespitosum) has a massive hypochil with basal callus and delicate epichil. The fifth group (Mi-crostylis ophioglossoides, Dienia ophrydis) is characterized by a lip with developed lateral lobes, three deep concavities in the middle part, an erect callus, and many raphide cells.

Here, we explore temporal and inter-individual patterns in pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation of Dianthussylvestris by Hadena moths, within and among three sex morphs. We scored plants that started flowering at different periods in 2001 and 2003 and found that fruit set decreased and predation rates increased over one season, and most of the other season, granting a female reproductive advantage to early flowering plants, though, we found no morph-specific temporal patterns. Female plants set more fruits, and more of their fruits escaped predation in one year, but this did not grant them a reproductive advantage since they produce fewer flowers per plant than the other morphs. Instead, mixed plants showed a clear female reproductive advantage. We also examined predation types by Hadena and seed production in attacked and intact fruits of individually marked flowers. Though female Hadena moths laid eggs preferentially into perfect flowers, flower sexes suffered similar predation by itinerant caterpillars. Attacked fruits contained fewer and lighter seeds than un-attacked ones. We conclude that pre-dispersal seed predation by Hadena may select on flowering onset of this sexually polymorphic species. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Dianthus sylvestris (Caryophyllaceae); Granivory; Gynomonoecy-gynodioecy; Hadena; Natural enemies; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66949117367

We examined within-population heterogeneity in the pollen pool at two spatial scales (sites and plants), and investigated the mating pattern variation in Myrtus communis under diverse situations of conspecific neighbourhood, using allozyme electrophoresis of naturally pollinated progeny arrays. For mating analyses, plants sampled were classified into four neighbourhood groups (from high to low) based on the local density around them and the distance to their nearest neighbour. The pollen pool was much more genetically heterogeneous among mother plants (~21%) than among sites (~2%), probably because of the high levels of selfing found (average s = 0.65). Outcrossing rates differed significantly among neighbourhood groups and showed a marked trend towards higher values from the lowest (tm = 0.26) to the highest (tm = 0.45) degree of conspecific aggregation. However, the lowest levels of biparental inbreeding and correlated paternity were found in the most isolated group of plants, indicating that these plants crossed with more and less genetically related fathers.

Both in vitro and in situ studies confirmed the presence of CRT mRNA and protein in pollen/pollen tubes and somatic cells of the pistil transmitting tract. The co-localization of these molecules in ER of these cells suggests that the rough ER is a site of CRT translation. In the pistil, accumulation of the protein in pollen tubes, transmitting tract epidermis (tte), and micropylar cells of the ovule (mc) was correlated with the increased level of exchangeable calcium.

There are two pollination mechanisms by which a non-rewarding orchid attracts pollinators and increases its reproductive success: (1) A magnetic species effect that occurs even though the flowers do not resemble those of the other species, and (2) floral mimicry where the mimic's flower resembles that of the model plant species. Oncidium cosymbephorum is a Mexican rewardless epiphytic orchid whose flowers look like those of the rewarding shrub Malpighia glabra (Malpighiaceae). The resemblance of O. cosymbephorum to the oil-offering flowers of M. glabra attracts the same pollinators, and the fitness of the orchid is higher when M. glabra is present than when it is absent. We evaluated the facilitation by M. glabra of the orchid's pollination for natural and artificial clumps of O. cosymbephorum close to and far from M. glabra over 4 years. Two experiments were performed at five different study sites to evaluate the effect of the presence and absence of M. glabra on the reproductive success of O. cosymbephorum. In experiment 1, we recorded fruit set production in natural and artificial monospecific clumps of the orchid, and in natural and artificial heterospecific clumps of O. cosymbephorum and M. glabra. In experiment 2, we recorded the fruit set of O. cosymbephorum at different sites where individuals grow in monospecific clumps, both before and after cultivated individuals of oil-producing M. glabra had been planted in their vicinity. Both experiments showed that the reproductive success of O. cosymbephorum was greater in the presence of M. glabra than it was in its absence. This study provides experimental evidence for the magnetic species effect. Floral similarity between O. cosymbephorum and M. glabra, should be experimentally tested to determine whether it is adaptive. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Floral mimicry; Fruit set; Magnetic species effect; Plant-animal interaction; Plant-plant interaction; Pollination; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349999428

Here we test key aspects of Darwin's hypothesis of reciprocal selection in an experiment with naturally interacting populations of extremely long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris: Nemestinidae) and long-tubed irises (Lapeirousia anceps: Iridaceae). We show that the benefit derived by both the fly (volume of nectar consumed) and the plant (number pollen grains received) depends on the relative length of their interacting organs. Each trait is shown to act both as agent and target in directional reciprocal selection, potentially leading to a race. This understanding of how fitness in both species varies in relation to the balance of their armament allows us to make tentative predictions about the nature of selection across multiple communities. We find that in each community a core group of long-tubed plant species might together be involved in diffuse coevolution with the fly. In poorly matched populations, the imbalance in armament is too great to allow reciprocal selection to act, and these species might instead experience one-sided selection that leads to convergence with the core species. Reciprocal selection drives the evolution of the community, then, additional species become attached to the network of interacting mutualists by convergence. © 2008 The Author(s).",Coevolutionary arms race; Diffuse coevolution; Escalation; Geographic mosaic of coevolution; Pollination network; Pollination syndrome; Red Queen hypothesis; Specialized pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249113942

In this paper, we assess this latter possibility, looking first at previous studies of floral scent variation in relation to abiotic environmental factors. We then present data from our own research that suggests among-population floral scent variation is determined, in part, by environmental conditions and thus displays phenotypic plasticity. Such an outcome has strong ramifications for the study of floral scent variation; we conclude by presenting some fundamental questions that should lead to greater insight into our understanding of the evolution of this trait, which is important to plant-animal interactions. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.",Abiotic factors; Aromatics; Floral scent; GxE interaction; Phenotypic plasticity; Pollination; Terpenoids; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59449097961

The morphological differentiation in androecia has been suggested as a reflection of ""labor division"" in pollination in which one type of stamens attracts pollinators and satisfies their demand for pollen as food and the other satisfies the plant's need for safe gamete dispersal. The extent and patterns of stamen differentiation differ notably among taxa with heterantherous flowers. Seven species with heteromorphic stamens in three genera were sampled from Leguminosae and Melastomataceae, and the morphological difference of androecia, pollen content, pollen histochemistry and viability, pollen micromorphology, as well as the main pollinators were examined and compared. Pollen number differs significantly between stamen sets of the same flower in most species investigated, and a correlation of pollen number and anther size was substantiated. Higher pollen viabilities were found in the long (pollinating) stamens of Senna alata (L.) Roxb. and S. bicapsularis (L.) Roxb. Dimorphic pollen exine ornamentation is reported here for the first time in Fordiophyton faberi Stapf. The height of stigma and anther tips of the long stamens in natural conditions was proved to be highly correlated, supporting the hypothesis that they contact similar areas of the pollinator's body.",Buzz pollination; Heteranthery; Labor division; Pollen micro-morphology; Pollen number; Pollination; Stamen differentiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62449307979

Once widespread and locally common on Mauritius, today R. simplex is critically endangered, with 85-90 known remaining individuals in a few scattered populations. We documented the unusual flowering and fruiting phenology and studied the pollination and seed dispersal ecology of R. simplex in the accessible flowering and fruiting populations. Endemic diurnal Phelsuma cepediana geckos were the only pollinators and the only animals eating the pulp and dispersing the tiny seeds. In experiments with captive geckos, we confirmed that geckos ingest the seeds and pass them apparently unharmed. This makes R. simplex one of the few known plants that use the same animal species for both pollination and seed dispersal. However, none of the seeds from fruits or gut-passed seeds germinated, highlighting the large gap that remains in our understanding of the germination and regeneration of R. simplex.

However, figs also host many non-pollinating wasps which are either parasitoids or resource competitors of pollinators, and bring no benefit for figs and are detrimental to fig' fitness. Our data on Ficus racemosa in Xishuangbanna showed that the numbers of non-pollinators and the mature syconia without pollinator wasps increase in rainy season, especially in the highly fragmented forest. This might be because of the longer developing time of the syconia and thereby longer oviposition time to non-pollinators in the dry season. The galled flower and the viable seed percentages in dry seasons are also larger than in rainy seasons in both primary forest and fragmented forest, and the development of non-pollinators is mainly at the expense of pollinator wasps. Our results showed that there exists a discriminative seasonal impact of non-pollinators and fragmentation effects on population size of fig's pollinators. This implies that fig/fig wasp mutualism is more fragile in dry season, and that the critical population size and breeding units of figs in seasonal area might be larger than previously estimated without considering the seasonal change of pollinator population. © 2009 Balaban.",Community structure; Conservation; Fig. tropical rain forest; Mutualism; Seasonal change,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64549118227

Marmoratum (Nichols.) Hara f. dissectum, in a temperate forest of Japan. As the distance from conspecific reproductive adults increased, the percentage of immature seed fall and empty seeds increased significantly, indicating higher pollination success along with local population density. Although the difference was not distinct, pollination success was affected by the local population density of the reciprocal sex morph rather than that of both sex morphs. The trees at higher local population density sites suffered higher seed mortality due to predation and decay, and tended to produce smaller seeds. Thus, the impacts of local population density operated both positively and negatively on reproduction. As a factor of individual traits, tree size scarcely affected any demographic processes. On the other hand, sex morph did affect pollination success. Trees of PG type had lower immature seed fall than those of PA type, suggesting that the former has higher efficiency of pollen acceptance than the latter.

To assess the potential for competitive and hybridising interactions between natives and alien taxa in the UK, we quantified abundance and co-occurrence in south-central Scotland in relation to physical variables, land cover, and habitat types. To do this we tested the influence of explanatory variables on incidence rates, densities and group sizes at three spatial scales (10 km, 1 km, and records) in selected 10-km squares. We found that (1) natives were nearly 99% of all bluebells recorded, (2) aliens were encountered more frequently than natives though in much smaller maximum numbers per group, (3) increasing rainfall was associated with increasing native and decreasing alien densities, (4) the presence of aliens related to variables correlated with human density, and (5) there was little evidence for habitat exclusivity. Mixed groups accounted for 10% of natives recorded, and over 40% of natives grew within about one kilometre of aliens. These distributions suggest that a high proportion of natives lie within range of potential gene flow via insect pollinators. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to quantify the effect of movement herkogamy in Kosteletzkya virginica on reproductive success and its contribution to pollen receipt and reproductive assurance. Field investigations and hand-pollination experiments were performed to test: (1) the relationship between herkogamy before curvature of un-pollinated lobes and reproductive success under pollinator exclusion; (2) the contribution of movement herkogamy to pollen receipt; and (3) the relationship between pollen load and seed set. We noted that variation in herkogamy before curvature of un-pollinated lobes did not affect the outcome of autogamous self-pollination measured by fruit set and mean number of seeds per fruit. Under natural conditions, 39% of pollen grains deposited per flower were from autogamous self-pollination via movement herkogamy resulting in contact between anthers and stigmas. The relationship between the amount of pollen grains and the number of seeds per capsule was highly significant. Flowers producing four or five seeds received more pollen grains than those producing only one seed. Our data provides experimental evidence that movement herkogamy, which decreases the separation between anthers and stigmas and results in delayed self-pollination, contributes to pollen receipt and further enhances seed set when pollinators are scarce or absent. © 2009 Ecological Society of China.",Delayed self-pollination; Kosteletzkya virginica; Movement herkogamy; Pollen receipt; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75549087277

We suggest here that the correlation between clade species richness and floral specialization is real, but that clade species richness is frequently the cause, not the result of floral specialization. We urge a broader, variance-partitioning perspective for assessing the causes of this correlation by suggesting four models of how the diversity-specialization correlation might come about: (1) floral specialization promotes initial reproductive isolation (""Initial-RI"" model), (2) floral specialization promotes reinforcement of reproductive isolation upon secondary contact (""Reinforcement"" model), (3) floral specialization reduces the extinction rate by promoting tighter species packing (""Extinction"" model), (4) floral specialization is the result of high clade species richness, which increases the number of related species in communities, and thus selects for floral character displacement (""Character-Displacement"" model). These hypotheses are evaluated by comparing the relationships between species richness, speciation mechanisms, and pollination precision, accuracy, and specialization in the broader literature and, more specifically, in four study systems: Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae), Collinsia (Plantaginaceae), Burmeistera (Campanulaceae), and Stylidium (Stylidiaceae). These systems provide stronger support for the character-displacement hypothesis, wherein local species diversity drives the evolution of specialized pollination. Although the two reproductive-isolation hypotheses may hold for plants like orchids, with extremely precise pollination systems, the reproductive character-displacement hypothesis seems likely to be more important for plant groups with less precise pollination systems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Character displacement; Pollination; Reinforcement; Reproductive isolation; Specialization; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58349088728

Few heterosis studies have been done in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. This is because manual cross-pollination is difficult and time-consuming, and not economical to produce large quantities of hybrid seed. Male-sterility systems identified in soybean, combined with insect-mediated cross-pollination, have been shown to produce large quantities of hybrid seed. This procedure was used in this study to produce hybrid seed for replicated yield trials with the objectives to: 1) evaluate the agronomic performance of soybean F1 hybrids; and 2) estimate heterosis for yield and other agronomic traits of the F1 hybrids. Parental genotypes were two male-sterile, female-fertile lines with the ms3 and ms9 mutations, and a group of six high-yielding male-parent lines. The experiment was conducted in two years at several locations. In 2005, twelve F1 hybrids were evaluated along with parent lines. Mid-parent heterosis (MPH) ranged from -29% to +32%, and high-parent heterosis (HPH) from -23% to +1%. In 2006, eleven hybrids were evaluated. MPH values ranged from -53% to -21%, and HPH from -66% to -35%. Seed size and seed protein content showed HPH for some combinations. For traits related to vegetative growth, such as height and lodging, positive MPH and HPH were observed. In general, depending on the year and parent combinations, there were hybrids that performed better than the mid-parent values, suggesting that heterosis was identified in soybean. Significant differences for yield between hybrids of the ms3 and ms9 groups also were observed.

The autofertile populations had fewer pollen grains, greater style-ovary angle, longer style, lower papillae density than autosterile ones. The rate of flower bud growth and the release of exudate were considered to be related to protogyny of autofertile materials. Pod setting and fertilization values of autosterile bulks were significantly lower than those of autofertile ones, however, the latter had higher percentage of seeds and inbred embryos abortion. Autofertility was due to a range of complex components, not just one or two, the inheritance of which should be taken into consideration when developing self-fertilized varieties of this species. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Autofertility; Faba bean; Heterosis; Segregation; Vicia faba,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650284244

Bumblebees are important pollinators in natural as well as agricultural ecosystems. Estimates of foraging range, population size and genetic population structure so far have been based on worker samples alone. Here we include both males and workers in a population genetic analysis to infer the contribution of males to these important ecological parameters. 2. The population genetic (microsatellite) analyses of Bombus terrestris L. populations on the island of Cabrera (Spain) and Halle (Germany) revealed high heterozygosities (0.60 ± 0.08 to 0.77 ± 0.13) and neither a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium nor linkage disequilibrium. 3. We detected five colonies (census population size) for the island population and 27 to 68 for the German mainland population. The genetic effective population sizes were Ne = 7.5 for the island and 40.5 to 102 for the mainland population respectively. 4. There was a significant genetic subdifferentiation between the male and the worker population samples, suggesting that males originated from different and/or more distant colonies than workers. 5. Based on the colony numbers, we estimated the flight range of males, which ranged from 2.6 km to 9.9 km, much further than worker flight ranges. Bumblebee-mediated pollen flow will therefore be much further than expected based on the foraging range of workers alone if males also contribute to pollination. © 2008 The Authors.",Bombus terrestris; Flight distance; Microsatellite; Population structure; Social insects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57549087596

Possible mechanisms were compared for pollen and vegetative microspores. Development of pollen (generative microspores) from knights' star (Hippeastrum hybridum) and vegetative microspores of Equisetum arvense were analyzed after treating with blockers of ion channels and anticontractile agents for 24 h (short-time experiments) and 25-28 days (long-time experiments). The blockers of Na+, K+, Ca2+ ion channels (relatively a-bungarotoxin; tetraethylammonium: verapamil) or anticonractile agents (cytochalasin B or colchicine, except papaverine or clofelin), depressed the germination (30-60 % in short-time exposures) of both types of microspores to different degrees depending on the concentration. Moreover in longtime experiments, the normal fruits were not formed from the pollens after pollination, while, in vegetative microspores the gamethophyte (thallus) and antheridia (male sexual organs) formation were inhibited. However, the actin from rabbit muscle, restored the vegetative microspore germination after the blockade of cholinoreceptor (related to Na+/K+; channels) by a-bungarotoxin or the intracellular binding with cytochalasin B, inhibitor of actin polymerization. The similar effects were observed in preliminary blockade of Ca 2+ channels with verapamil in pollen of knights' star. Thus, the pathways of chemosignal transduction from the cell are discussed in relation to possible mechanism of allelopathy.",Actin; Chemosignaling; Contractile proteins; Ion channels; Model systems; Pollen allelopathy; Unicellular models; Vegetative microspores,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349904660

Apart from cultivated fields, alfalfa is also found along roadsides and in natural and semi-natural habitats. However, little information is available on the establishment capabilities of alfalfa in noncultivated areas and the potential of these founding populations to become feral. Some crop species have not lost all their wild characteristics during the domestication process and with several inherent traits favoring weediness, alfalfa could be one among those that can become feral. There is great interest in the feral potential of alfalfa, particularly due to the concerns that feral plants could act as genetic bridges and facilitate novel trait movement at the landscape level. Alfalfa is the first perennial, insect-pollinated crop to be genetically engineered and approved for unconfined release into the environment. This review investigates and compiles information in the literature that reveals the life history components that can influence ferality in alfalfa. Characteristics that can contribute to ferality in alfalfa include high genetic diversity, perenniality, quick regrowth potential, persistence, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, deep tap root system, drought and cold tolerance, and seed dormancy. With these traits, alfalfa is equipped to invade and dominate unmanaged habitats. Feral alfalfa populations can and will act as bridges for long-distance gene flow and facilitate the adventitious presence of novel traits in the environment. As such, feral populations will become a potential barrier for achieving coexistence of transgenic and nontransgenic alfalfa fields. Implications of ferality, including gene flow and hybridization with compatible wild relatives are also discussed in detail. This review serves as a resource for environmental risk assessment for the release of alfalfa containing novel traits.",Adventitious presence; Alfalfa; Coexistence; Ferality; Genetic modification; Trait confinement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349134111

Increasing pollen-load increased the number of fruit per plant in the four melon cultivars over two growing seasons, and in two non-parthenocarpic cucumbers, but had no effect on all four squash cultivars. In most cases, increasing pollen-load increased the number of fullydeveloped seeds, decreased the percentage of empty seeds, and tended to decrease mean seed weights. On average, melons produced 2.2 fruits per plant in the Winter, and only 0.9 fruits per plant in the Autumn. In contrast, melons produced 275 fully-developed seeds per fruit in the Autumn, but only 57 seeds in the Winter. Mean melon seed weight was higher in Autumn, and the sum of all seed yield component effects resulted a significantly higher seed yield per plant in the Autumn. Germinability of melon seeds from the Autumn season, and of squash seeds from the Winter season, were not significantly affected by pollen-load treatment. These data are contrary to the theory that microgametophyte competition has a positive effect on the vigour of the progeny. The lower germinability of melon seeds obtained by passive pollination (i.e., self-pollination in covered flowers) may be due to the fact that pollination without insect or human interference yielded only a few seeds per fruit, and, under such circumstances, there may be a survival advantage for slow and distributed germination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72749109150

The transgenic safflower used as the pollen source was transformed with a construct for seed-specific expression of a high-value protein and constitutive expression of a gene conferring resistance to the broad-spectrum herbicide glufosinate. Progeny of non-transgenic plants grown in plots adjacent to the transgenic pollen source were screened for glufosinate resistance to measure outcrossing frequency. Outcrossing frequency differed among locations: values closest to the transgenic pollen source (0 to 3 m) ranged from 0.48 to 1.67% and rapidly declined to between 0.0024 to 0.03% at distances of 50 to 100 m. At each location, outcrossing frequency was spatially heterogeneous, indicating insects or wind moved pollen asymmetrically. A power analysis assuming a binomial distribution and a range of alpha values (type 1 error) was conducted to estimate an upper and lower confidence interval for the probable transgenic seed frequency in each sample. This facilitated interpretation when large numbers of seeds were screened from the outcrossing experiments and no transgenic seeds were found.

We examined the breeding and pollination systems, level of pollen limitation and seed production in populations of a threatened ""ornithophilous"" species, Aloe pruinosa. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that A. pruinosa is genetically self-incompatible and thus an obligate outcrosser. Experimental exclusion of birds from inflorescences did not affect seed production, suggesting that insects are effective pollinators. Supplemental hand-pollinations in several populations showed that seed production in A. pruinosa is not pollen limited. Further, there were no significant relationships between population size and any measure of reproductive success in this Aloe species.

The nature and extent of bumble bee decline in North America is poorly understood due mainly to a lack of baseline and long-term data. Museum collections provide excellent sources of information on past and current species distributions, which can be used to infer changes in the composition of insect communities. Using the Illinois Natural History Survey's electronic database of Hymenoptera and a recent biodiversity survey of historically sampled localities, we were able to examine changes in the richness and distribution of the bumble bee fauna of Illinois over the last century. We found that bumble bee species richness declined substantially during the middle of the century (1940-1960). Four species were locally extirpated: Bombus borealis, Bombus ternarius, Bombus terricola and Bombus variabilis. The ranges of Bombus affinis, Bombus fraternus, Bombus pensylvanicus and Bombus vagans have also decreased in Illinois. Our analyses also indicated that current bumble bee diversity is highest in northern Illinois, where conservation efforts would be most productive. Our study demonstrates that half of the bumble bee species found historically in Illinois have been locally extirpated or have suffered declines, supporting observations of broader declines in North America. Major declines in the bumble bee fauna coincided with large-scale agricultural intensification in Illinois between 1940 and 1960. Attempts to conserve bumble bees in Illinois should involve wildlife-friendly approaches to agriculture, such as increasing agricultural land set-asides and hedgerows, and employing integrated pest management. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",Bee conservation; Biodiversity; Hymenoptera database; Museum data; Pollinator decline; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57149091107

We examined mean thorax widths (a reliable measure of body size) of workers of Bombus pascuorum, B. lucorum, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris at sites with and without honeybees. Workers of all four species were significantly smaller in areas with honeybees. We suggest that reduced worker size is likely to have implications for bumblebee colony success.

In the present study, two trials were conducted using open-pollinated offspring of six and 18 half-sib families in 2006 and in 2007, respectively. Significant variation was found both within and between families in terms of seedling height, stem diameter, the number of nodes, and internode length in both 45-d-old and 1-year-old seedlings. Moderate to high heritability (0.39 - 0.88) was estimated by between-family variance, implying that the majority of phenotypic variations were under additive genetic control. Seedling height was positively correlated with seedling diameter (r = 0.87), the number of nodes (r = 0.86), and the length of the internodes (r = 0.89), indicating that measuring only seedling height was adequate to identify families that produce dwarf seedlings. The shortest seedlings were generally observed in the offspring of low-vigour and cluster-bearing families.

Our scientific knowledge of bees consists largely of behavioral or macroscopic-level biological studies. Although in the past several decades there have been some advances in our knowledge of specific hormones, genes, and proteins, molecular biology of bees remain poorly understood relative to the depth to which we understand humans, and typical model organisms such as the mouse or fruit fly. This is due in part to the lack of available reagents for interrogating protein-specific information in standard assays such as Western blot, immunolocalization, and im- munoaffinity purification, as well as a relatively difficult system for introducing small, interfering RNAs. Given the available genome sequence then, mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques are ideally suited to studies in bees; starting from so little knowledge, the discovery-based nature of proteomics should allow for a very steep learning curve relative to better-studied systems such as fruit fly. To this end, twenty-two honey bee proteomics papers have been published since 2005. Here we present a brief summary of biochemical/molecular biological research in bees, including some of the challenges; we focus on the proteomics work to date, and relate these findings to recent transcriptomic work and proteomic studies in other social insects. We end with some speculation on where proteomics is most likely able to provide insight into bee biology where other methods would fail. As the general population and scientific community become increasingly aware of the value of honey bees to both our economy and ecosystem, proteomics will play an important role in improving our understanding of this beneficial insect. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Honey bee; Innate immunity; Insect; Polyphenism; Royal jelly; Social insect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650915052

Low levels of genetic variation of Bombus ardens have been reported in a previous mitochondrial (mt) gene study. In this study, we sequenced the complete internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of the nuclear rDNA obtained from 100 B. ardens individuals collected from several Korean localities, in an effort to assess its usefulness in characterizing the genetic diversity and relationships among populations of B. ardens. The ITS2 sequences of B. ardens were shown to be longest among known insects, ranging in size from 1,971 -1,984 bp. The sequences harbor four duplicated repeats-?27 bp repeats, ?20bp repeats, ?33bp repeats, and ?34bp repeats-which have never before been reported in other insect ITS2 rDNA The maximum sequence divergence of 1.01% among 96 sequence types confirmed the applicability of this molecule to the study of intraspecific variation, revealing higher sequence variation as compared to the previously studied mt COI gene. Overall, a very high per generation migration ratio (Nm= 5.83?infinite) and a very low level of genetic fixation (Fsr = 0 - 0.08) were noted to exist among populations of B. ardens. The high estimation of gene flow among most populations-in particular, between the remote island Ulleungdo and several inland populations-suggest that historical events may be more responsible for the contemporary population structure of B. ardens. The finding of the lowest genetic diversity (?) in the population on Ulleungdo Island (? = 0.007434) may be reflective of a relatively small population size and the geographical isolation of the population as compared with other inland populations.",Bombus ardens; Genetic diversity; Geographic variation; Hymenoptera; ITS2,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350151543

The germination temperature ranged from 10 to 35°C, and seeds could germinate in full light and in the dark. The seeds had no significant maturation dehydration and had weak desiccation-tolerance, so their storage behaviour should be classified as recalcitrant.

Although in vitro techniques are recently extensively applied in plant breeding programmes, these are not commonly utilized in caraway. Therefore, based on the protocol for anther culture in carrot (Daucus carota L., a closely related species of caraway in Daucaceae family), in vitro androgenesis in caraway has been studied with the aim to produce completely homozygous inbred lines. Various induction conditions, such as temperature pretreatments, carbon sources and combination of growth regulators in a culture medium as well as the effect of genotype on in vitro androgenesis were examined. Ten breeding lines of winter caraway representing third generation of forced (artificial) self-pollination were used as donor plant material. Cultured anthers produced embryogenic calli, and subsequently two types of regenerated plants were obtained, namely haploids with evident microspore origin, and diploids which may represent somatic (anther wall) regenerants or spontaneous doubled haploids. The ploidy status of regenerated plants was determined by flow cytometry.

It is therefore important to include these services in the national system of economic accounts. This requires estimation of ""accounting prices"" for ecosystems, that is, the marginal value of a change in the size of the system. This raises a number of questions: What do we mean by the ""size"" of the system? What is the dynamics of the system? How do we quantify the impacts on services from a change in the size of the system and finally how do we value these impacts? We discuss these questions in a few examples of ecosystems, and valuation as such is not the major problem. The major problem is the lack of information of the appropriate dynamic model for most systems.

Thus, the objectives of the study were to quantify the inter- and intra-population variations in seed size traits and germination responses to different constant temperature regimes. Seeds were collected from 30 open-pollinated families within each of the five populations representing the natural distribution of the species in Ethiopia. To examine seed size variations, seed length, seed width, and 1,000-seed weight were quantified. Inter- and intra-population variations in seed germination were investigated under different constant temperature regimes from 20 to 35°C in climate chambers. Significant variations in seed length, width and weight were detected both at inter- and intra-population levels, and family heritabilities of 0.63-0.76 showed that much of the phenotypic variation in seed size traits were additive genetic variation. Significant variation in germination was also found among and within populations as well as between the different constant temperature regimes. Generally the variation in germination was considerably higher within population than between populations. The optimal temperature for germination of C. africana seeds was 25-30°C with family heritabilities for germination ranging between 0.20 and 0.33, depending on the germination temperature. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ethiopia; Germination capacity; Heritability; Provenance; Seed weight,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56649120501

The presence of an exotic plant may decrease the visitation rate to native plants and thus increase pollen limitation. Flower visitors may also switch between exotic and native plants and if pollen from an exotic plant is transferred to native plant stigmas this may impede siring by conspecific pollen. As flower visitors forage within a spatial context, the distribution of plants may affect the type and magnitude of pollinator-mediated competition. In this study we examined two questions: 1) does the exotic plant, Carduus nutans (Asteraceae) interact with the native Monarda fistulosa (Lamiaceae) through flower visitors by changing visitation rate and/or through heterospecific pollen transfer, and does this affect seed set of the native plant? 2) Does spatial context affect how the native and exotic plants interact through flower visitors? We created plots containing potted M. fistulosa with and without the presence of potted C. nutans. In the presence of C. nutans, M. fistulosa stigmas had significantly fewer conspecific and more C. nutans pollen grains. Visitation rate and seed set tended to be lower in these invaded plots, however they were not significant. In a second experiment, we examined whether changes in visitation rate to M. fistulosa due to the presence of C. nutans was a function of M. fistulosa distance from C. nutans. We found that visitation rate did not decrease in the presence of C. nutans when M. fistulosa were adjacent to C. nutans or 15 meters from C. nutans. However, floral visitation rate to M. fistulosa decreased at 1 and 5 meters from C. nutans. Our results suggest interactions between plant species through flower visitors may depend on spatial scale. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149120815

The genus in this broad sense has an exceptional diversity of insect pollination adaptations among its colourfully adorned species, from food-rewarding generalists to specialists achieving pollination by sexual deception of male thynnid wasps. The exploration of diversity in Caladenia involves many of the great names in the foundation of Australasian plant systematics, as well as reflecting a remarkable second phase of discovery and description over the past three decades. Molecular phylogenetics has greatly clarified relationships of Caladenia and established six major clades within the genus. Some researchers regard these clades as genera themselves, whereas they are treated as subgenera herein to maximise nomenclatural stability and information retrieval. More work is needed to adequately document relationships within each of these clades, and disputed matters of typification greatly influence nomenclature applied to many species if the six clades are recognised as genera. Given the relatively recent and ongoing discovery of so many new species in Caladenia, the biology of these orchids is only now being documented comprehensively. Significant advances in pollination ecology, mycorrhizal studies, horticulture and conservation biology are emerging that highlight the extraordinary ecological sensitivity and conservation vulnerability of the genus. Indeed, the high species number and complex biotic connections have resulted in no other genus of terrestrial orchids possessing such a large number of rare and threatened taxa.

'Grand Champion' was genotyped to S bS e by an S-RNase-based cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker system. Crossing 'Grand Champion' with pollen from an SI cultivar, 'California' (S bS e), showed that partial SC was caused by the disruption of pistil function. Of the S b-and S e-RNase alleles cloned from 'Grand Champion', the S b-RNase allele had two nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions compared with the S b-RNase allele previously cloned from 'Doyenné du Cornice', but it retained the typical primary structure of S-RNases of the Maloideae. The sequence of the S b-RNase allele from 'Grand Champion' was also obtained from two SI cultivars: 'Joséphine de Malines' and 'Urbaniste'.

When there was a relatively low maximum of 10 pollen grains of either Alliaria petiolata or Hesperis malronalis on stigmas of Alyssum alyssoides, Lepidium campestre and Sisymbrium altissimum, the pollen tube generation declined by 80% and the difference compared to stigmas with no heterospecific pollen was significant (Pearson product moment tests, P < 0.001).

The study, which sought to determine the effects of various weather-related parameters on Alnus pollen counts, was performed using a volumetric method. The main pollination period for this taxon is January-February. Alder pollen is one of the eight major airborne pollen allergens found in the study area. An analysis was made of the correlation between pollen counts and major weather-related parameters over each period. In general, the strongest positive correlation was with temperature, particularly maximum temperature. During each period, peak pollen counts occurred when the maximum temperature fell within the range 9°C-14°C. Finally, multivariate analysis showed that the parameter exerting the greatest influence was temperature, a finding confirmed by Spearman correlation tests. Principal components analysis suggested that periods with high pollen counts were characterised by high maximum temperature, low rainfall and an absolute humidity of around 6 g m-3. Use of this type of analysis in conjunction with other methods is essential for obtaining an accurate record of pollen-count variations over a given period.",Aerobiology; Alnus pollen; Correlations; Meteorological parameters; Principal components analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57849142046

A tomato ARF gene, homologous to Arabidopsis NPH4/ARF7 and therefore designated as Solanum lycopersicum ARF7 (SlARF7), was found to be expressed at a high level in unpollinated mature ovaries. More detailed analysis of tomato ovaries showed that the level of SlARF7 transcript increases during flower development, remains at a constant high level in mature flowers, and is down-regulated within 48 h after pollination. Transgenic plants with decreased SlARF7 mRNA levels formed seedless (parthenocarpic) fruits. These fruits were heart-shaped and had a rather thick pericarp due to increased cell expansion, compared with the pericarp of wild-type fruits. The expression analysis, together with the parthenocarpic fruit phenotype of the transgenic lines, suggests that, in tomato, SlARF7 acts as a negative regulator of fruit set until pollination and fertilization have taken place, and moderates the auxin response during fruit growth. © 2008 The Authors.",Auxin response factor; Auxin signaling; Fruit set; Parthenocarpy; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149133670

The mechanisms involved are diverse, ranging from the recognition of pathogen invaders to the execution of signaling cascades that trigger their destruction. Thus, several pathogens and parasites exploit or hijack plastid functions to evade host defenses. Plastids are also implicated in the adaptation of plants to low nutrient environments.

However, interbreeding among subspecies is less often recognized as a serious threat to native species. Phragmites australis offers an excellent opportunity to investigate intraspecific hybridization since both native and introduced lineages occur in North America. Introduced Phragmites is a highly successful estuarine plant invader throughout North America, but native Phragmites populations are declining in the eastern US. Despite range overlaps, hybridization has not yet been detected between the native and introduced lineages in the wild, suggesting that phenological or physiological barriers preclude cross-pollination. We demonstrate, for the first time, that native and introduced populations of Phragmites can hybridize. There is substantial overlap in flowering period between native and introduced populations from the same geographic locations. We manually cross-pollinated native individuals with pollen from introduced Phragmites and recovered viable offspring. We then used microsatellite markers to prove that alleles unique to the pollen parent were transferred to progeny. Our results imply a mechanism for the further decline of native Phragmites in North America and a potential for the formation of aggressive hybrid offspring. © The Author(s) 2009.",Hybridization; Invasive species; Microsatellites; Phenology; Phragmites australis; Vigor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149101498

A hybrid seedling progeny trial was planted, comprising material generated by controlled pollinations in two within-species half-diallel mating designs with seven E. grandisand seven E. urophyllaclones as parents, and in a between-species factorial mating design, using all of these same parents. Genetic parameters of the inter- and intra-specific crosses, for measurements of 22-, 35-, 60- and 72-month over bark diameter at breast height (dbh) and 12-month height, are presented in this paper. The general combining abilities of the parents in the pure species half-diallels were zero for all measurements, except for the 12-month height measurement in E. urophylla. This can be explained by the fact that parents chosen for this study were known to be good volume producers as pure species individuals. When these same parents were hybridised they showed a range of general hybridising ability estimates from ?1.35 to +1.51 (?7.3% to 8.2%) for dbh at 72 months. There is thus a difference between the parents mean performance for diameter growth in pure species and hybrid combination. In the hybrid factorial, dominance genetic effects accounted for nearly 60% of the total genetic variance for the 35-, 60- and 72-month dbh measurements, which can be seen in the relatively large specific combining effects in the hybrid crosses. The specific hybridising ability estimates for the 72-month dbh measurement covered a wider range in the hybrid factorial of ?4.24 to +3.09 (?23.0% to +16.8%) compared to the specific combining abilities from the pure species diallels, where E. grandisranged from ?0.11 to +0.13 (?0.7% to +0.8%) and E. urophyllafrom ?1.46 to +2.47 (?9.9% to 16.8%). If these results are confirmed in larger mating designs with progeny established on multiple sites, it seems that the most appropriate breeding strategy for E. urophylla × E. grandishybrids may be one that exploits non-additive variance, such as the reciprocal recurrent selection scheme or reciprocal recurrent selection with forward selection. © NISC Pty Ltd.",Eucalyptus urophylla × E. grandishybrids; General hybridising ability; Heritability; Specific hybridising ability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859399747

Gynodioecy often depends on persistent polymorphisms for both cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) genes and nuclear restorers of male fertility. Questions: How do ecological gradients affect population sex ratio? Is sex-ratio variation attributable to variation in the nuclear-cytoplasmic genetic composition of populations? Is there spatial covariation between CMS types and nuclear restorer alleles among populations? Study system: Late-successional populations of gynodioecious Thymus praecox, a species widespread in the European Alps and distributed from subalpine to alpine altitudes. Methods: We surveyed sex-ratio variation of adults along altitudinal gradients. We used offspring sex ratios from open pollination in natural populations and from controlled crosses within and among populations to estimate the diversity and spatial distribution of sex-determining alleles. Results: The proportion of hermaphrodites decreased with increasing altitude. However, offspring sex ratios were constant across altitudes, indicating similar cytonuclear genetic diversity at contrasting adult sex ratios. Sex-determining alleles were geographically widespread, but significantly higher proportions of hermaphrodites produced by within-population crosses compared with those among populations indicated locally adjusted restorer frequencies. Balancing selection may act on sex-determining genes. Our findings further point to a role for environment-dependent selection via the relative maternal fitness of females and hermaphrodites in maintaining the altitudinal sex-ratio variation.",Cost of restoration; Cytoplasmic male sterility; Ecological gradient; Gynodioecy; Local adaptation; Nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions; Offspring sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249238667

We obtained similar topologies through minimum evolution analysis using Nei-Li genetic distances and parsimony analysis. Our analyses supported the monophyly of most species, and indicated that the single annual species, P. micranthum , is sister to all perennial species. Relationships were well resolved among species separated by genetic distances > 0.16. Three well-supported clades each included taxa from one of three species complexes: the P. caeruleum complex, the P. pulcherrimum complex, or the P. viscosum complex.

Hand pollinations of Amborella trichopoda (Amborellaceae) in New Caledonia show that when the stigma is first receptive, the female gametophyte is near maturity. Pollen germinates within 2 h, and pollen tubes with callose walls and plugs grow entirely within secretions from stigma to stylar canal and ovarian cavity. Pollen tubes enter the micropyle within 14 h, and double fertilization occurs within 24 h. Hundreds of pollen tubes grow to the base of the stigma, but few enter the open stylar canal. New data from Amborella, combined with a review of fertilization biology of other early-divergent angiosperms, show that an evolutionary transition from slow reproduction to rapid reproduction occurred early in angiosperm history. I identify increased pollen tube growth rates within novel secretory carpel tissues as the primary mechanism for such a shift. The opportunity for prezygotic selection through interactions with the stigma is also an important innovation. Pollen tube wall construction and substantial modifications of the ovule and its associated structures greatly facilitated a new kind of reproductive biology.",Amborella; Callose plug; Carpel; Double fertilization; Evolution of development; Heterochrony; Novelty; Origin of angiosperms; Pollen tube growth; Stigma,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60249084571

Here, we irradiated etiolated petioles of Kaori-no-mai with a 320-MeV carbon-ion beam at 0-16Gy to increase flower color variation by mutation. Some of the M2 plants derived from self-pollination of M1 plants irradiated at 2Gy were flower-color mutants that retained desirable flower shape, flower size, and leaf color. One of the mutants bloomed novel red-purple flowers, the major anthocyanin of which was delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside. Loss of methylation activity at the anthocyanin 3'- and 5'-hydroxyl groups with little influence on anthocyanin concentration was attributed to the mutation. Because the major anthocyanins in flowers of Cyclamen spp. were previously restricted to malvidin, peonidin, and cyanidin types, the generation of a cyclamen containing mostly the delphinidin-type anthocyanin is an important breakthrough in cyclamen breeding.

It facilitates the rapid adhesion, hydration, and growth of the male gametophyte to the female gametophyte. As well, it functions as a molecular screen to promote male gametophytic competition and species-specific recognition and compatibility. Here, we characterize the transmitting tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) and pollen tube growth in basal-relictual angiosperms and test the hypothesis that a freely flowing ECM (wet stigma) was ancestral to a cuticle-bound ECM (dry stigma). We demonstrate that the most recent common ancestor of extant angiosperms produced an ECM that was structurally and functionally equivalent to a dry stigma. Dry stigmas are composed of a cuticle and primary wall that contains compounds that facilitate the adhesion and growth of the male gametophyte. These compounds include methyl-esterified homogalacturonans, arabinogalactan-proteins, and lipids. We propose that transmitting tissue evolved in concert with an increase in cuticle permeability that resulted from modifications in the biosynthesis and secretion of fatty acids needed for cuticle construction. Increased cuticle permeability exposed the male gametophyte to pre-existing molecules that enabled rapid male gametophyte adhesion, hydration, and growth as well as species-specific recognition and compatibility.",Arabinogalactan-proteins; Cuticle; Dry stigma; Homogalacturonans; Pollen-carpel interactions; Pollination droplet; Transmitting tissue; Wet stigma,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60249083141

A clonal woody species, Prunus ssiori, was partially self-incompatible according to a pollination experiment. Its main pollinators, bumble bees, were often observed to consecutively visit inflorescences within a tree. Clone identification revealed that its genets formed mutually exclusive patches. These features suggest frequent geitonogamous pollination. In a 6.24-ha plot, 212 trees belonged to 59 genets, and 42 genets consisted of a single tree, whereas the rest contained two or more clonal trees. The largest genet had 65 trees and occupied 0.4 of a hectare. Fruit set was measured in 127 inflorescences sampled from nine maternal trees at the center of the plot. Paternal genets of 107 of their 300 seeds were assigned in the plot using microsatellites. There were no selfed seeds. Male reproductive success (the probability that individual trees of each genet sired a seed) increased as tree size increased, as the distance between the trees and maternal trees decreased, when the genet did not contain the maternal trees, and when the genet consisted of a single tree. Female reproductive success (fruit set in individual inflorescences of each maternal tree) increased as the within-tree geitonogamy index, which reflected the frequency of pollination within the maternal tree, decreased. These results suggest that clonal growth reduces male reproductive success, at least, in P. ssiori, because of pollen discounting. © 2008 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.",Clonal reproduction; Geitonogamy; Mating system; Microsatellite; Pollen discounting; Pollen limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149194930

This study was conducted to elucidate the unknown molecular basis of self-compatibility (SC) in a selection line 1K0-26, an offspring of 'Benisashi' × 'Koshinoume', to explore the possible use of this line for SC breeding in Japanese apricot. Controlled pollination and segregation analyses demonstrated that 1K0-26 has an intact SI S7 haplotype and a pollen-part mutant SC S3' haplotype. Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the S3' locus revealed a 7.1 kb insertion in the pollen determinant SFB3, which makes a premature stop codon to produce transcripts for truncated dysfunctional SFB, just like the mode of mutation in SFBf, another SC S haplotype in Japanese apricot. The inserted sequence appeared to be a non-autonomous retroposon with long terminal repeats, a part of which is identical to part of the inserted sequence to SFB f.

Accuracy of individual assignment differed by population type, and it was higher (>90%) for restricted-based cultivars than for ecotypic and nonrestricted-based populations. These results indicate that SSR marker profiles can be effectively used to assign individuals for outbreeding populations such as perennial ryegrass.

We revisit write-ahead logging with an eye toward finer-grained concurrency and an increased range of workloads, then remove two core assumptions: that pages are the unit of recovery and that times-tamps (LSNs) should be stored on each page. Recovering individual application-level objects (rather than pages) simplifies the handing of systems with object sizes that differ from the page size. We show how to remove the need for LSNs on the page, which in turn enables DMA or zero-copy I/O for large objects, increases concurrency, and reduces communication between the application, buffer manager and log manager. Our experiments show that the looser coupling significantly reduces the impact of latency among the components. This makes the approach particularly applicable to large scale distributed systems, and enables a ""cross pollination"" of ideas from distributed systems and transactional storage. However, these advantages come at a cost; segments are incompatible with physiological redo, preventing a number of important optimizations. We show how allocation enables (or prevents) mixing of ARIES pages (and physiological redo) with segments. We present an allocation policy that avoids undesirable interactions that complicate other combinations of ARIES and LSN-free pages, and then present a proof that both approaches and our combination are correct.

Five hectares of small scale trial of rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell.-Arg.], was established in the Northwestern region of São Paulo State, Brazil. The population comprises 98 clones mostly derived from intensively selected plus tree in the natural forest of rubber tree in the Amazon. Three open pollinated progeny tests were established in three experimental stations. Seedlings from 98 progenies including a commercial check (CC) were planted in each one of the three locations. Assessments were made when the plants were one, two and three years old. The variation among progenies for girth was highly significant in all locations examined. In the combined analysis of variance over three locations, differences among progenies were also detected, while progeny x location interaction effect was not significant. Narrow sense heritability estimates on individual tree basis (hi 2) were variable depending on the characteristic, age of assessment and experimental location. Realized genetic gains were calculated for the plant characteristics at the age of three years, by comparing the performance of improved (selected) materials to unimproved materials (CC). The total genetic gain from the genetically tested first generation clone population at Votuporanga is estimated as 25% for girth, 14% for rubber yield and 25% for bark thickness.

The material analysed consisted in growth, form and frost resistance assessments of 58 open pollinated half-sib families at 3 to 4 years old across three sites in Galicia (NW Spain). Analysis of variance revealed that family × site interactions were quantitatively important for all traits (diameter, volume, branch angle, straightness and frost resistance). The losses in potential genetic gain for a breeding population were important for all traits under individual selection but only for diameter and frost resistance under family selection. Omission of the ten most interactive families from the analysis considerably reduced the losses for all traits, although losses in potential genetic gain remained important for frost resistance under family selection. The results indicate that elimination of these families from breeding programmes would be an effective strategy for selecting for stability in performance across sites for all traits except frost resistance. In order to overcome this problem, selecting varieties for frost resistance specifically adapted to various regional contexts would be an option.

While florivory has mainly been studied for its consequences on seed production or siring success, little is known about its impact on mating systems. Damage to flowers can alter pollinator attraction to the plant and may therefore modify patterns of pollen transfer. However, the consequences of damage for mating systems can take two forms: a decrease in flower number reduces opportunities for intra-inflorescence pollen deposition (geitonogamy), which, in turn, may lead to a decrease in selfing; whereas a decrease in floral display may also reduce overall visitation and thus increase the chances of self-pollination via facilitated or autonomous autogamy. We investigated the effects of damage by a bud-clipping weevil (Anthonomus signatus) in Fragaria virginiana in an experimental setting mimicking natural conditions. We found that increased damage led to an increase in selfing, a result consistent with the increased autogamy pathway. We discuss the implications of this finding and evaluate the generality of florivore-mediated mating system expression. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Autogamy; Floral display; Florivory; Geitonogamy; Herbivory; Plant mating system; Selfing rates,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649129597

In contrast with this prediction, 42% of seed-plant species are reported to have rates of self-fertilization between 0.2 and 0.8. We propose that many previous models fail to predict intermediate selfing rates because they do not allow for functional relationships among three components of reproductive fitness: self-fertilized ovules, outcrossed ovules, and ovules sired by successful pollen export. Because the optimal design for fertility components may differ, conflicts among the alternative pathways to fitness are possible, and the greatest fertility may be achieved with some self-fertilization. Here we develop and analyze a model to predict optimal selfing rates that includes a range of possible relationships among the three components of reproductive fitness, as well as the effects of evolving inbreeding depression caused by deleterious mutations and of selection on total seed number. We demonstrate that intermediate selfing is optimal for a wide variety of relationships among fitness components and that inbreeding depression is not a good predictor of selfing-rate evolution. Functional relationships subsume the myriad effects of individual plant traits and thus offer a more general and simpler perspective on mating system evolution. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

We conducted a series of crosses to analyse the genetic basis of sex determination in this species. Dutch populations of U. dioica contain low proportions of monoecious individuals beside male and female plants. Self-pollination of monoecious plants always yielded female, male and monoecious plants, generally in a ratio of one female to three male/monoecious individuals. This motivated us to write down a simple model in which gender is determined by one major sex-determination locus with four alleles. In the model males and monoecious plants have distinct genotypes but are both heterozygous at the sex-determination locus. We first made crosses among progeny obtained after self-pollination of monoecious plants. These crosses showed that the monoecious trait generally showed Mendelian inheritance and was passed on to the next generation via both pollen and seeds. Further crosses between monoecious plants and plants from dioecious system indicated that alleles from the dioecious system are often dominant. However, many exceptions to our genetic model are observed which suggest that dominance is incomplete and/or that more genes are involved in sex determination. We discuss to what extent sex determination genes explain the strongly biased seed sex ratios and argue that additional genes, for instance genes for female choice, must also be involved. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Dioecy; Dominance; Genetics; Monoecy; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349696862

The association of the organs in the same deposit, assignment of each taxon to Cycadales, and histological features shared among the taxa suggest they were all produced by the same plant. The Antarcticycas plant is reconstructed as a small plant, possibly with a subterranean stem; it was probably similar in habit to small-stemmed species of extant Zamia. Antarcticycas stems are inferred to exhibit apical rather than axillary branching based on reinterpretation of type material that shows a branching axis accompanied by anatomy indicative of the presence of cone domes when observed in extant cycads. The presence of a bulbil on one specimen indicates that branching also took place through adventitious budding. The Antarcticycas plant is similar in its anatomy to extant cycads, although contractile tissue and coralloid roots have yet to be identified and may not have been present in the fossil plant. The plant inhabited a warm temperate polar habitat with protracted periods of winter darkness for which there is no modern equivalent. Evidence for deciduousness in this taxon, previously suggested as a possible adaptation to its warm, light-limited environment, is equivocal. The possibilities that fire played a role in the Fremouw peat ecosystem and that the Antarcticycas plant may have been insect pollinated are explored. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Neither perfect nor imperfect seeds found in seedy cultivars/offspring were formed in 'Mukaku Kishu' and its seedless descendants. Among 'Mukaku Kishu' and its seedless descendants, the fertilized seed type (termed ""type A seeds"") with an immature, soft seed coat was specifically observed. In most seedless cultivars/offspring, all embryos of type A seeds were arrested at the zygote or proembryo stage, and embryo development was arrested 10 weeks after pollination. These results indicate that the expression of Mukaku Kishu-type seedlessness is characteristic of a forming type A seed with an immature seed coat and an embryo arrested at an early stage. Endosperm abortion in type A seeds was not observed. Therefore, we demonstrated that an arrested embryo development in the type A seed is not caused by endosperm abortion. Because the expression of Mukaku Kishu-type seedlessness is not controlled by the embryo genotype, type A seed production would not be caused by gene expression in embryos but by that in maternal tissues, more likely in the immature seed coat tissue.

Schrad.] is an annual broadleaf weed species native to Eurasia and introduced as an ornamental to the Americas by immigrants in the mid- to late 1800s. Although sometimes categorized in the genus Bassia, there is no compelling reason for this classification. This naturalized species is a common and economically important weed in crop production systems and ruderal areas in semiarid to arid regions of North America, and has expanded northward in the Canadian Prairies during the past 30 yr. Although primarily self-pollinated, substantial pollen-mediated gene flow and efficient seed dispersal aids both short- and long-distance spread. The weed is morphologically highly variable, and its growth and development are markedly affected by environmental conditions. Kochia, a C4 species, is highly competitive in cropping systems because of its ability to germinate at low soil temperatures and emerge early, grow rapidly, tolerate heat, drought and salinity, and exert allelopathic effects on neighboring species. Moreover, herbicidal control has been compromised to some extent by the widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in the species. Kochia is used as a forage, is palatable to livestock with nutritional value similar to that of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), but can be toxic if it comprises the majority of the diet. Although kochia pollen is an allergen, the seed is a source of phytochemicals including mosquito pheromones and saponins that are potentially beneficial to human health; kochia also is beneficial in phytoremediation of soils contaminated by hydrocarbons or pesticides.",Bassia scoparia; Herbicide resistance; Kochia; Kochia scoparia; Soil salinity tolerance; Weed biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649647612

Plants from three CMS lines were cultivated at distances 10 m, 1.0 km and 1.5 km from the male fertile line used as pollen donor. The assessment of the seed set of the CMS plants showed a decrease in the pollination with the distance from the pollen donor plants. The microsatellite analysis of bulk samples from the collected seeds demonstrated pollen dispersal from the pollen donor plants over all three tested distances. Further analysis of individual seeds suggested that a small portion of the collected seeds may have resulted from selfpollination of studied CMS lines and crosspollination between them. The observed restoration of fertility in the CMS lines was most probably caused by the excessive rainfall and lower average temperatures during the period of the flowering of the CMS lines. The stability of a wider range of CMS lines carrying cytoplasms from H. petiolaris, H. argophylis, H. rigidus and H. praoxes species were evaluated within three years (20062008) in two different locations in Bulgaria. Sixteen CMS lines, studied in 2006, were sterile in tested environmental conditions. Six of the CMS lines were further assessed in the period 20072008 after two periods of sowing and parallel cultivation in greenhouse. The investigated CMS lines differed in regard to the stability of cytoplasmic male sterility. Four of them were fully sterile across all nine different environmental conditions in the period 20062008. Two CMS lines showed unstable sterility that varied under the different environmental conditions. The restoration of fertility in these CMS lines was partial and affected only few individual plants. Taken together these data suggest that the climatic condition (temperature, humidity and daily light intensity) may affect the stability of sterility of the sunflower CMS lines depending of their genotype. The results from the present study indicated that long distance pollen dispersal is a major factor limiting the cultivation of transgenic sunflower plants. The prevention of transgenic pollen spread through cultivation of transgenic CMS plants has to be well evaluated in direction to the stability of the used CMS lines for each specific location, multiple periods of cultivation and various climatic conditions. © 2009 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",CMS lines; Cytoplasmic male sterility trait; Microsatellite analysis; Pollen flow; Sunflower; Transgene flow mitigation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349630146

It has high palatability, forage quality, seedling vigor and dry matter (DM) yield. Due to low availability of cool season annuals and perennials in early autumn and winter, animals are fed on stored forages. Annual ryegrass, along with perennial grasses, has high spring production but is lacking in late autumn and winter production. The primary objective of the breeding project was to shift the yield distribution of annual ryegrass towards the winter to make it available for grazing and to reduce the dependence of livestock on stored forages and grain. The base population was created from six top performing cultivars in Alabama. Plants were open-pollinated and bulk harvested for two seasons to create a random mating base population (C0). Three cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection along with C0 were used to study correlated responses such as heading date, plant type and seed yield. Each population was increased in replicated seed increase nurseries using a randomized complete block (RCB) design with four (2007/08) or two (2008/09) individual isolation nurseries per population. Each plot consisted of 200 plants and heading and plant type data were collected on each plant during the reproductive stage. For all correlated responses, C1 showed a significant change from C0 with exception of seed yield in 2008. There was no further change during successive cycles (C2, C3). With three cycles of selection, selected populations shifted their heading date 8 d earlier, had a more erect growth habit and increased seed yield than C0. Of the three correlated responses, seed yield has shown a population x evaluation year interaction. © CBCS 2009.",Dry matter yield; Heading date; Plant erectness; Recurrent phenotypic selection; Seed yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901792705

For both crops, traditional sources of seed meet more than two-thirds of the total demand and the rest is met by the organized sector, mainly public seed agencies. Most farmers buy fresh seed for reasons of quality, and only 12-15% purchase seed to change varieties. Technological innovations that increase the multiplication rate and improve the quality of seed provide a significant cost advantage in potato, and therefore have attracted the private sector's participation. This trend has been strengthened by the availability of source seed from public plant breeding programmes. However, it is unlikely that self-pollinated crops will attract private investment in plant breeding in the near future. Therefore, the public research system should continue to take responsibility for plant breeding and develop partnerships with the private sector to promote decentralized seed production and distribution. The development of supply chains, especially for premium markets, is another way to attract commercial interest in the seed as well as the product market.",Groundnut; India; Potato; Seed production; Seed systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953596352

E. Walker, a member of Asteraceae, is a highly invasive species. However, its reproduction biology remains poorly known. To understand the role of reproductive traits in successful invasion of the species, we studied several traits of its reproductive system: the miniature capitulum and gynomonoecious sexual system, the biology and phenology of capitula and florets, pollen/ovule ratio, the mating system (selfcompatibility), flower visitors, physical traits and dispersal potential of achenes, germination potential of achenes from manually pollinated capitula, and the association of these traits with invasiveness. Our study showed that the reproductive traits of autonomous seed production, versatile mating system of self- and cross-pollination, and generalized pollination system might contribute to the species' successful invasive capability. The invasiveness was further enhanced by the high and rapid production of achenes, as well as the high percentage, rapid germination rate and high dispersal capability of achenes. It was concluded that in annual or winter-annual weeds, autonomous seed production contributed significantly to the invasiveness of the species.",Asteraceae; Conyza sumatrensis; Gynomonoecy; Invasiveness; Mating system; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650175888

Stem straightness (STR) and branch size (BRA) were assessed at age 5 years and at the final measurement. At age 5 years, the Lewotobi provenance displayed the fastest growth, with only minor differences among other provenances. Growth traits had within-provenance, narrow-sense heritabilities ranging from 0.10 to 0.31. Heritability for DBH increased with age, but for HT it became stable after age two years. Coefficients of additive genetic variation for growth traits ranged from 7.3 to 12.4%. Heritabilities for STR and BRA were from 0.09 to 0.22. Age-age genetic correlations for growth traits between earlier and later measurements increased with age from 0.27 to 0.97. The genetic correlations between growth (DBH, HT) and form ( STR, BRA) were weak to moderate. Genetic correlations between sites for DBH and HT increased with age and became stable after age 3 years.

Here genetic diversity and patterns of genetic variation within and among 11 populations were analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers with 97 individuals across its whole geographical range. High levels of genetic variation were revealed both at the species level (P<inf>99</inf> = 96.012%; H<inf>t</inf> = 0.302) and at the population level (P<inf>99</inf> = 51.41%; H<inf>s</inf> = 0.224). Strong genetic differentiation among populations was also detected (F<inf>ST</inf> = 0.2961; II = 0.281), which corresponded to results reported for typical animal-pollinated, mixed selfing, and outcrossing plant species. This result was consistent with mating patterns detected by our pollination experiments. The indirect estimate of gene flow based on II was low (N<inf>m</inf> = 0.64). Special habitat and its life history traits might play an important role in shaping the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of this species. A pollination experiment also failed to detect significant inbreeding depression upon F<inf>1</inf> fruit set, seed weight, and germinate rate fitness-traits. As a naturally rare species, T. pingbianensis is not seriously genetically impoverished and likely to have adapted to tolerating a high level of inbreeding early in its history, we propose this species need only periodic monitoring to ensure their continued persistence, but not intervention to remain viable. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",AFLP; Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Inbreeding depression; Naturally rare plants; Tupistra pingbianensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849124579

Conservation strategies for P. uliginosa require information about the evolutionary history and genetic structure of its populations. Using isozymes we assessed the genetic structure of P. uliginosa from four isolated stands in Poland and compared the results to genetic structures of other closely related pine species including eight populations of Pinus mugo, ten of Pinus sylvestris and one of Pinus uncinata. The level of genetic variability of P. uliginosa measured by the mean number of alleles per locus and average heterozygosity was similar to others related to P. uliginosa taxa from the reference group but it differs among populations. High genetic similarity was found between two populations of P. uliginosa from Low Silesian Pinewood. The populations were genetically distinct as compared to other populations including locus classicus of the species from the peat bog at Batorów Reserve. Very low genetic distance (DN = 0.002) and small genetic differentiation (GST = 0.003) were found between P. uliginosa and P. mugo in the sympatric populations of the species from Zieleniec peat bog suggesting the ongoing natural hybridisation and genetic contamination of peat-bog pine from this area. Some evidence for skew in allele frequency distribution potentially due to recent bottleneck was found in population from Low Silesian Pinewood. The analysed open pollinated progeny derived from two P. uliginosa stands from Low Silesian Pinewood showed the excess of homozygotes as compared to the maternal trees indicating high level of inbreeding (F = 0.105, F = 0.081). The results are discussed in the context of evolution of P. uliginosa populations, taxonomic relationships between the analysed species and conservation strategies for active protection of peat-bog pine.",Endangered species; Gene flow; Genetic structure; Isolated populations; Izozymes; Peat bog pine; Pinus uliginosa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350654291

Lysine is converted to saccharopine, through condensation with ?-ketoglutarate, by LKR, and subsequently to glutamate and ?-aminoadipate-?-semialdehyde by SDH. To investigate lysine catabolism in maize kernels, we generated transgenic plants with suppressed LKR/SDH activity in either endosperm or embryo. We found that the suppression of LKR/SDH in endosperm induced an increase in free lysine in developing endosperm, which peaked at 32 days after pollination. At later stages of kernel development, most of the free lysine was found in the embryo along with an elevated level of saccharopine. By combining endosperm LKR/SDH suppression with embryo LKR/SDH suppression through crosses, the saccharopine level in embryo was reduced and resulted in higher lysine accumulation in mature kernels. These results reveal new insights into how free lysine level is regulated and distributed in developing maize kernels and demonstrate the possibility of engineering high lysine corn via the suppression of lysine catabolism. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",High lysine maize; Lysine; Lysine catabolism; Lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH); RNAi,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56949098282
