In both models, a plant allocates the resources available in the flower stage to its attractive structures, ovule production, and/or reserves in the fruit stage. The pollinator availability for the year (in the first model) or the resource availability of the fruit stage (in the second model) is unpredictable. I show that large variability in pollinator or resource availability does not always select for an increase in the number of ovules produced by the plant. Rather, the plant decreases its ovule number in habitats where pollinator or resource availability is more variable. In the first model, this occurs if the expected pollinator availability is large, the resource availability is small, the recovery rate of reserved resources is small, or the prior selfing rate is large with a large degree of inbreeding depression. In the second model, it occurs if the pollinator availability is small or the expected resource availability is large. Thus, the bet-hedging hypothesis within the context of variation in ovule/flower number does not always work for ovule production in environments where pollinator or resource availability is unpredictable.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030574421

Yield was not apparently limited by pollen availability. However, the first node to bear pods was lower in open- than in self-pollinated plants, which developed more flowers into young pods. The superabundance of flowers developed into young pods was compensated by adjustment of other yield components to achieve the physiological maximum yield. Open pollination may also have increased both pod and seed set, but only to a lesser extent, and depended on year and genotype. The results of these experiments also suggested that yield regulation operated by different mechanisms for the various genotypes; particularly, abortion of young pods, ovules and seeds, and seed-size adjustments. In some genotypes, many young pods were produced but few matured; in others, few ovules develop into seeds, or seeds remained small.

Most of the species were dominated by a single floral scent compound. Most of the compounds identified in this study have been previously reported in floral scents collected with head-space techniques from other plant families. However, several of the fatty acid derived esters of hexanol and cis-3-hexenol present in Lecythis persistens have been reported only in one or a few other plant families. No apparent correlations were found between amount and number of floral scent compounds produced on the one hand and pollinator reward, morphology, color, or size of flowers on the other hand The fatry acid derivatives found in Grias suggest that beetles may be the pollinators whereas the floral scent compounds of all other species studied are consistent with bee pollination. The floral scents of the nectar-producing species Eschuetleva coriacea and Couratari stellata contain, in contrast to the pollen-producing species, compounds that are highly attractive to male euglossine bees. This suggests that floral scent may play a role in directing male euglossine bees to those species of Lecythidaceae providing nectar as a pollinator reward.

As suggested by the bird syndrome of the flowers, these are mainly pollinated by hummingbirds. Occasional visits by other birds, butterflies and more rarely bees, as well as tamarin monkeys were also observed. Trigona bees partly destroy the flower tube to rob nectar. The possibility that S. globulifera may not be primarily adapted to hummingbird pollination is discussed. The pollen is intermixed in an oily fluid secreted by the anthers (aniheroil). Each of the five stigmas consists of a pore-like opening at the apex and a small chamber behind it. The anthcroil mixed with pollen is absorbed by capillarity into the chamber when deposited on the pore. The pollen germinates inside the stigma. The presence of antheroil and pore-like stigmas in the flowers of the closely related Plaionia insignis indicate a similar mode of pollination. The results of this study are compared with observations in some other Clusiaceae (Caraipa, Clusia, Garcinia, Mahurea), where floral oils or floral resin occur. The role of these substances in the pollination process and their relation to the evolution of flower biology in Clusiaceae are briefly discussed.","Clusiaceae, Guttiferae, Symphonia; Pollination, nectar, hummingbirds, perching birds, antheroil",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001672572

Nectar-collecting honeybees did not contact reproductive parts of flowers. Pollen-collecting honeybees preferentially visited male-stage flowers but rarely visited female-stage flowers. Fruit set on caged inflorescences that allowed access to honeybees but excluded birds was reduced by more than 50% compared to inflorescences that were visited by both types of visitors. Further, fruit set on caged inflorescences was less than on bagged inflorescences that excluded both birds and honeybees, indicating that pollen removal by bees decreased opportunities for delayed autonomous selfing in the absence of birds. Although fruit set was not pollen-limited at the study site, pollen removal by honeybees would decrease fruit set in small populations where birds are scarce. In addition, pollen removal by honeybees would reduce opportunities for outerossing and reproductive success through male function. Although honeybees have been in Australia for insufficient time to have exerted selection on floral traits, evolutionary shifts in response to these animals are likely to occur in the future.","Flora of Australia; Pollinator efficiency, nectar-feeding birds, Apis mellifera; Proteaceae, Grevillea barklyana",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002569313

Most populations are monomorphic, indicating that frequency-dependent selection may limit the spread of the rare allele within a population. Also, the vast majority of populations are composed of the dominant (spotted) phenotype. To determine whether fertility selection mechanisms might favor one phenotype over the other and/or act in a frequency-dependent manner, I examined pollinator behavior and postpollination success in these plants. Differential pollinator visitation among floral spot phenotypes was tested using experimental arrays placed into natural populations composed of different frequencies of the two phenotypes. Slight pollinator preference for spotted plants was detected in some arrays; in no array was there significant preference for unspotted plants, even when the background population was 100% unspotted plants. There was no evidence of frequency-dependent visitation behavior by pollinators. A hand-pollination experiment explored the relative abilities of the two floral morphs to sire and mature seeds when given ample pollination, both in single- and mixed-donor pollen loads. Pollen from spotted plants sired 10% more seeds than pollen from unspotted plants in the single-donor treatments, although phenotypic frequencies of offspring from mixed-donor loads did not differ from random expectation. Maternal seed maturation rates did not differ between morphs. These results support a previous finding of a consistent male fitness advantage for spotted plants over the whole range of phenotypic frequencies found in natural populations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030299162

We examined the ecological and genetic consequences of exclusive pollination by sexually attracted male thynnine wasps in the orchid Caladenia tentaculata. Male wasps respond rapidly to flowers artificially presented in 1 x 1 m2 experimental patches. Sixty of 287 wasps approached within centimeters of the flower, but did not land. Of the remaining 79% who made floral contact, only 7.5% attempted copulation, the step critical for pollination Wasps only rarely moved among patches (19% of flights) and none attempted copulation a second time, resembling observations in natural populations. We confirmed outcrossing and long distance pollen flow by monitoring how colored pollen moved in natural populations. Pollen movements approximated a linear rather than a leptokurtic distribution (mean distance: 17 m; maximum: 58 m). Pollinator visits varied independently of flower density in three of four populations with most solitary flowers being visited. Allozyme analysis revealed within-population fixation indices (F) close to zero and low levels of differentiation (FST) among populations. Despite behavioral evidence for long distance pollen flow, significant local genetic structure exists, perhaps reflecting restricted seed dispersal. Long distance pollen flow in C. tentaculata may therefore promote outbreeding by minimizing pollen transfers among related neighbors. Although this species is self-compatible, outcrossed progeny develop significantly faster than selfed progeny. Effective pollination at low flower densities could accentuate this advantage. The data are consistent with the predictions that deceptive pollination will result in long distance pollen flow, which may be of selective advantage at low density. Comparative studies of how food reward, food deceptive, and sexual deceptive pollination systems vary within a phylogenetic framework could further illuminate the evolution of sexual deception.",Orchid; outcrossing; pollen flow; pollination; population genetic structure; pseudocopulation; selection; sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301373

Only 4.1% (N = 169 pollinia) and 8% (N = 244 pollinia) of the pollinia collected from pollinators of A. syriaca and A. exaltata, respectively, were identified as pollinia from the other species. Natural levels of interspecific pollination, 3.6% (N = 166 pollinia) on A. syriaca and 3.1% (N = 228 pollinia) on A. exaltata, were typically lower than the number of foreign pollinia carried by pollinators.

Parent trees were grouped into four classes of local stand type, ranging from isolated trees to dense stands. The inclusion of stand type in the model improved significantly the fit and caused a reduction of 4 to 13% in the heritability. Growth was clearly depressed in progeny from isolated trees or remnant stands. Levels of abnormalities in the seedlings varied slightly amongst stand types (p = 0.11) but the trend was less obvious. Results suggest that stand type classification accounted for some of the selfing and neighbourhood inbreeding in open-pollinated families. Correlations between breeding values estimated with and without stand type in the model were usually above 0.95 so selection efficiency is likely to be little affected.

Foraging sunbirds insert their bills into the labellum chamber of the flowers and suck nectar from the labellum spurs with their tongues. The column overarches the entrance to the labellum and pollinaria become affixed to the upper mandible of the bill. Birds often attempt to remove pollinaria by rubbing their bills against a branch, but are mostly unsuccessful due to the large plate-like viscidia which attach the pollinaria very firmly to the bill. Other modifications for bird pollination in these Satyrium species may include the red, carmine or orange colour of the flowers, sturdy inflorescence stems used for perching and large amounts of dilute nectar in the spurs. Each Satyrium species was pollinated by several species of sunbird, and despite some differences in flowering time, occasional hybrids occur at a site where S. carneum and S. coriifolium share the same sunbird pollinators.","Flora of southern Africa; Orchidaceae, Satyrium, Nectarinia; Pollination, ornithophily, nectar",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030450799

We used isozyme electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to characterize genetic variation in populations of P. guyannense from French Guiana. Both measures detected a surprisingly low level of genetic variation, with only five out of twenty (25%) allozyme loci polymorphic (P), 1.35 alleles per locus (A), and an expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.090 at the species level. Isozymic genetic variation was even lower within populations (P = 17.5, A = 1.24. He = 0.074), and was corroborated by a RAPD assay that used 26 arbitrary primers (P = 3.61, A = 1.04, He = 0.014). Although overall levels of variation were low, the detectable variation was distributed as would be expected for an outcrossing species with extensive gene flow (mean GST = 0.230).

Species with shorter tongues were increasingly sternotribic at 2285-2675m and included more workers at these sites. Corbicular pollen loads from 141 pollinators indicated a distinctly lower pollen-foraging constancy at 2105m than at higher elevations, but at all elevations pure loads were most frequent. It is suggested that the extension of Pedicularis bracteosa var. paysoniana over the entire montane-subalpine ecotone has been facilitated both by its adaptability to differences in the physical environment and by its accommodation to related pollinators having distinct foraging patterns.",Bombus; bumblebees; ecotone; Pedicularis; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030432929

The development of hybrid alfalfa cultivars would likely improve forage yield potential, but an efficient method to estimate outcrossing rates would be needed to confirm percentage hybrid seed. The objective of this research was to demonstrate the applicability of a RAPD nulliplex analysis to estimate outcrossing/selfing rates in autotetraploid alfalfa. Marker selection is based on polymorphism between a seed parent and its bulk open-pollination progeny. Polymorphic markers identify the seed parent as nulliplex (aaaa) for those particular loci, which allows the individual open-pollinated progeny from that seed parent to be classified as F1 or S1 progeny based on the presence/absence of these markers. Two alfalfa genotypes served as seed parents in crossing studies which differed in pollination control and number of pollen parents. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) nulliplex analysis was conducted on these two seed parents and their progeny. Controlled crossing and selfing provided independent control over S1s and F1s. Five polymorphic markers were identified for both seed parents and these markers were sufficient to identify S1 and F1 progeny. The percentage S1 seed was 7, 27, and 100% for crossing with emasculation, crossing without emasculation and self-pollination, respectively. In conclusion, RAPD nulliplex loci analysis can provide accurate identification of F1 and S1 progeny and an estimation of outcrossing rates in autotetraploid alfalfa.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942705036

The effects of hurricane damage exemplify this phenomenon. When most organisms are adversely affected, it is expected that the dynamics of their interactions will also be altered. The consequences of a direct hit by Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, on a plant-pollinator interaction was investigated by comparing pre-hurricane (1981-1985) with post-hurricane data (1989-1990). The nectarless, self-compatible Epidendrum ciliare L. (Orchidaceae) is pollinated by Pseudosphinx tetrio (L.) (Sphingidae), a large hawkmoth. Despite severe habitat alteration and some plant damage (uprooting, breakage and sun scortching), flowering phenology was apparently unaltered. Pollinator service was different from that of previous years in that more flowers were visited (57% vs. 28-41%). The higher number of effective visits increased pollinarium removals, but the number of pollinia depositions remained about the same (11% vs. 11-15%). Fruit fates differed among seasons. Post-hurricane loss of fruits to rat predation was higher than previous years, but the proportion of fruits reaching maturity was similar to prehurricane seasons. Final fruit set after the hurricane (5.3%) fell within the range of previous years.

Male flowers of C. pusilla and Clusia sp. of sect. Clusiastrum offer pollen as a reward for large, middle-sized and small bees, who vibrate the anthers to collect pollen. Female flowers are rewardless and unusual in the gems by the presence of long styles.

Honeybees had the highest visitation rates to flowers of the three species but are relatively ineffective pollinators. Bats had higher visitation rates to flowers of cardon than birds, which had higher visitation rates to flowers of saguaro and organ pipe than bats. Results of pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that visits by bats accounted for most of the fruit set in cardon, visits by birds and bees accounted for most of the fruit set in saguaro, and birds accounted for most of the fruit set in organ pipe. Hand-pollination experiments suggest that fruit set in females but not hermaphrodites of cardon, a trioecious species, and organ pipe is pollen-limited, probably owing to the scarcity of bats. Crude estimates of the per-visit effectiveness of different groups of pollinators for fruit set indicate that bats are somewhat more effective than birds and much more effective than bees. Competition for pollinators between the three species of cacti is reduced by seasonal or daily phenological differences. The flowering seasons of cardon and saguaro broadly overlap, but these species differ in the times their flowers open and close (earlier at night and the next morning, respectively, in cardon) and in their nectar secretion schedules. Saguaro flowers are more available to diurnal pollinators than those of cardon. The flowering peak of organ pipe occurs much later in the spring than the other two species; its opening and closing and nectar secretion schedules are similar to those of cardon. At our study site, the importance of bats as pollinators of columnar cacti is currently much lower than in other arid zone columnar cacti.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030441087

The ponticulus of P. atlantica was formed from the funicle only, in contrast to that of P. vera, which developed from both the funicle and the ovary wall. This may be one of the causes of reduced interspecific as compared with intraspecific fertility. Shell indehiscence and premature splitting were more common following interspecific pollination of P. vera. Ovary wall and shell thickness at the suture were lower in P. atlantica than in P. vera, while the suture angle was greater. Following interspecific pollination of P. vera, both ovary wall and shell thickness at the suture were lower and the suture angle was greater than following intraspecific pollination. In the shells of some fruits, more than one groove was observed in areas other than the usual split zone.

For many years, plant breeders have been unable to make much headway since various compensating factors operate, e.g. inbreeding depression and self-fertility of cross-breds. However, the improved performance of the newer varieties has hopefully indicated that, as a result of a better understanding of the complexities involved in natural pollination and the components of yield, breeders have been able to improve substantially the competitive position of Vicia faba as a crop in relation to cereals.

The ""Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,"" a paradigm of pollination ecology and angiosperm evolution, suggests that the severity of such interspecific pollen transfer should reflect the similarity in the architecture of sexual structures (specifically, placement of stigma and anthers) among the flowers involved. We evaluated the hypothesis with six species of Costa Rican cloud-forest plants varying greatly in sexual architecture but all pollinated by the same hummingbird, Lampornis calolaema. Captive Lampornis visited five long-styled, ""pollen-donor"" flowers of distylous, self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), then 20 short-styled recipient flowers of Palicourea, with or without five flowers of a second species intervening. We assessed intraspecific pollen transfer from Palicourea donors by counting pollen tubes in styles of the recipients. We examined interspecific pollen transfer between Palicourea and each of the five other species by counting heterospecific grains deposited on stigmas of Palicourea recipients, and Palicourea grains deposited on stigmas and anthers of the heterospecific flowers. In a separate experiment, we examined how mixed-species flower visits modified the pollen loads actually carried by birds. Results did not uphold the Sexual Architecture Hypothesis. A single visit to any heterospecific flower greatly affected the hummingbird's prior load of Palicourea pollen, regardless of where the second species placed its own pollen on the bird. Interspecific pollen transfer occurred consistently, but (1) heterospecific grains usurped little space on stigmas of Palicourea recipients and had no discernible effect on pollen-tube growth, whereas (2) few Palicourea grains landed specifically on anthers and stigmas of heterospecific flowers. Instead, numerous Palicourea grains apparently were scraped off on other floral structures such as the corolla. Consequently, every species of intervening flowers, regardless of its sexual architecture per se, strongly reduced pollen transfer from donor to recipient Palicourea flowers, on average by 76%. In fact, the most drastic reductions resulted from the two species whose sexual architectures least resembled that of Palicourea. Results imply that ""pollen scraping"" by floral structures other than anthers and stigmas may be important and widespread among some animal-pollinated flowers. Thus, except in cases where no other floral structures contact pollinators, the positions of anthers and stigmas alone may have little bearing on the severity of interspecific pollen transfer and competitive interactions among plants sharing pollinators.",Character displacement; Cloud forest; Competition for pollination; Costa Rica; Flower mixtures; Heterostyly; Hummingbirds; Interspecific pollen transfer; Pollen carry-over; Pollen placement; Pollen Scraping Hypothesis; Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030404521

This gene flow is affected by traits that have been subject to sexual selection. Pollen dispersal depends on the competitive ability of the plant in attracting pollinators. Further, the pollen grains per se are under sexual selection to fertilise the ovules. Traits expressed by the female also influence the number of offspring a pollen donor can sire. The gene dispersal from a transgenic plant thus depends on interactions with the surrounding plants in the area where it is planted. This means that the risk of unwanted gene dispersal varies in time and space.

The phenology of tropical gynodioecious figs is important to vertebrates relying on fig fruit as a resource, and to understanding the evolution of gynodioecy in Ficus. 2 Gynodioecious fig species have hermaphrodite trees with closed, urn-shaped inflorescences bearing male and female flowers, and female trees with inflorescences bearing female flowers. Pollinators entering receptive inflorescences on hermaphrodite trees pollinate, lay eggs in female flowers, and die; weeks later, offspring emerge, mate and carry pollen from hermaphrodite trees to other trees. Wasps entering inflorescences on female trees pollinate female flowers but cannot lay eggs, and die without leaving offspring. Hermaphrodite ('male') trees produce pollen and wasps, and no seeds; female trees produce only seeds. 3 During 1991 and 1992, I observed the phenology of two gynodioecious fig tree species, Ficus exasperata and F. hispida, in a dry and a wet site in Coorg District, south India. 4 Ficus exasperata trees displayed a synchronous phenology very similar to that predicted by one hypothesis relating the evolution of gynodioecy to phenology. Female trees of F. exasperata produced seeds synchronously during the monsoon season and 'male' trees produced pollinator wasps and pollen synchronously during the peak period of female receptivity. Crop production occurred more frequently in the dry than in the wet site. Female trees bore mature fruit for longer periods than 'male' trees. 5 In contrast, several phenological traits of F. hispida departed strongly from prediction. This species displayed an asynchronous phenology at the population level. Receptivity and wasp or seed production in F. hispida occurred year-round, female trees produced more crops than 'male' trees, and there was considerable overlap in timing of 'male' and female inflorescence production. Durations of phenological phases were longer on female than on 'male' trees at the wet site. 6 An asynchronous phenology appears to be more advantageous in aseasonal than in seasonal environments. If the two phenological types observed in this study are found to be widespread, then the possibility that functional dioecy in Ficus evolved via more than one pathway must be considered.",Dioecy; Evolution; Ficus; Flowering; Fruiting; Hymenoptera; India; Moraceae; Pollination; Tropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302257

These species produce many inflorescences with vast numbers of flowers, yet seed-set is typically very low. Most species studied appear to have at least limited self-compatibility and outcrossing rates close to one. Despite this, pollinators normally deposit a large amount of self-pollen on stigmas. In this study, we used experimental pollinations to test for evidence of preferential outcrossing within populations of Banksia spinulosa and Banksia ericifolia. Our allozyme analysis of progeny arrays indicates that the studied populations of both B. spinulosa from a prior study and B. ericifolia as determined for 27 plants in this study are highly outcrossed. Results from pollinations using applications of self- and cross-pollen and mixtures of the two indicated that, at the early prezygotic stage, all treatments had an equal potential to produce seed. This contrasts with the observation of almost no pollen tube growth from the autogamy treatment conducted on B. spinulosa. Seed-set from experimental treatments was low for both species, and only one inflorescence from each species produced seed after self-pollination. This indicated that self-pollen may be inhibited at some later stage, but self-fertilization is possible. However, small sample sizes meant that there were no significant differences in seed-set between treatments. When mixtures of self- and cross-pollen were applied to stigmas, the genetic composition of resulting seeds showed that most progeny were derived from outcrossing events. This preferential outcrossing may occur via a recessive lethal system. Moreover, the results provide an explanation for the observed discrepancy between the high outcrossing rates obtained for both species and observations that pollinators are likely to transfer large amounts of self-pollen.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301239

These populations differed in FA for only one floral trait, long filament length. After adjusting for organ size differences, we found floral FA values were about half those of leaves. These are the first quantitative data indicating that flowers are more developmentally stable than leaves. In a second experiment, greenhouse grown plants from two other C. tembloriensis populations (one highly outcrossing and one predominantly self-pollinating) did not differ significantly in floral FA or in within-plant variance of floral traits, though earlier studies of the same populations revealed significant differences in FA of leaf traits. In both experiments, FA values of different floral traits were uncorrelated. We attribute the lack of significant differences in floral stability between populations to the greater canalization of floral organs and to the magnification of measurement error that occurs when calculating FA.

Female moths pollinate and oviposit in the gynoecium of the flower; however, maturing larvae eat a fraction of the developing seeds. We studied within-fruit distributions of four seed types (fertile, infertile, eaten and uneaten seeds) in order to evaluate costs and benefits in a Yucca schottii population in southeastern Arizona. We focused on how the spatial arrangement of seeds affected larval behaviour and, hence, the costs of the mutualism to the yucca. Infertile seeds were distributed throughout both infested and uninfested locules. Additionally, moth larvae feeding in a single locule preferred fertile seeds and even avoided infertile seeds and left the fruit significantly more often when they encountered infertile seeds. We suggest that, regardless of the cause of infertile seeds, they function as blocking units within seed locules and therefore reduce seed predation by moth larvae. We also suggest that, together with certain other fruit traits, the presence of infertile seeds promotes the evolutionary stability of this pollination mutualism. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.",Obligate mutualism; Pollination; Resource limitation; Seed predation; Yucca-yucca moth interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668127

The morphology of the inflorescences, the quantity and chemistry of the nectar, time-lapse video monitoring and other evidence suggest that the Dactylanthus flowers are adapted for pollination by short-tailed bats. Ship rats are also effective pollinators but occasionally destroy the inflorescences. Kiore completely destroyed all the inflorescences observed on Little Barrier Island in 1992 and 1993, although some seed was found there in 1991. Dactylanthus plants have been successfully cultivated by sowing seeds close to the roots of broadleaf plants. Germination was very slow with the highest rates occurring nearly five years after the seed was sown. Further research is needed to clarify the role of fungal hyphae found inside the cells of a young plant and that of the sheath processes which may assist vegetative reproduction. Video monitoring provided evidence that the introduced possum, by browsing the inflorescences, threatens the survival of Dactylanthus at most North Island sites. Where possums were present, and the plants unprotected, almost all the inflorescences were browsed. Adult plants at the main study site had a half-life of only 8.5 years. Conservation management to ensure the survival of Dactylanthus will require protection of the plants from possums, rats and humans and adequate areas of secondary forest containing abundant host plants.",Conservation; Dactylanthus taylorii; Ecology; Pollination; Possums; Short-tailed bats; Threatened plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030326815

A species of Hypoperlidae, an extinct family ancestral to bark-lice, bugs and plant-hoppers, and two species of Grylloblatida, a predominantly Permian group with a few extant representatives related to stoneflies, contain protosaccate taeniate grains of several pollen genera well known as dispersed microfossils and occasionally found in sporangia of conifers, peltasperms and glossopterids. This is so far the earliest direct evidence of pollinivory, a major factor of plant-insect coevolution. The partly digested pollen grains reveal infratectal reticulum and other structural details of evolutionary significance. It is suggested that the peculiar taeniate pollen of worldwide distribution in the Permian might simultaneously evolve in several groups of Paleozoic seed plants in relation to pollinivory that, by altering the micropyle load and thereby the pollen/ovule ratio, could also affect ovuliferous structures. Thus pollinivory might impel rapid diversification of gymnosperms in the Permian.

P. kanei), P. hirsuta, P.flammea, and P. lapponica in West Greenland. Pedicnlaris lanata depends on insects for seed set. P. hirsitta and P. flammea are able to set seed by autodeposition, but P. flammea less successfully than P. hirsuta. Pedicnlaris lapponica mainly propagates vegetatively. Insects are rarely seen visiting the four species in the investigated area. In P. lanata the number of germinated pollen grains per stigma is much lower on average than the number of ovules per ovary, and the seed set is consequently well below its potential. Accordingly, we believe that pollen availability limits seed. Multispiked individuals of P. lanata have a lower seed set and a higher mortality rate than single-spiked plants. Pedicularis hirsuta allocates most resources to reproduction and has the highest P/O-ratio and relative reproductive success (RRS) in the area, thus being the most successful species of the four regarding seed production. Pedicularis lanata has the lowest relative reproductive success of the three sexually reproducing species due to low seed set. The four species possess flowers adapted for insect pollination, but are using different and alternative means to maintain populations: vegetative propagation, autogamy, visits by unspecialized insects, and by being perennial. © 1996 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030299208

Bailey Hortorium, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States","Various hypotheses that seek to explain the rich species diversity of angiosperms relative to other seed plants are briefly mentioned or reviewed. Of these, the subset that relates angiosperm diversity in some way to the relationship between angiosperms and insects, particularly anthophilous insects, is here the object of attention. Specifically, I address and reject the possibility that the relationship between angiosperm diversification and insects, particularly those demonstrating a preference for flowers with derived floral characteristics associated with insect pollination, may be ruled out because of asynchronous patterns of diversification in the fossil record. New data on floral structure from the Turonian of the Atlantic Coastal Plain reveal a surprising diversity of floral characters in taxa bearing tricolpate and tricolporate-derived pollen. The characters and taxa that appear in these Turonian sediments suggest that rather specific modes of insect pollination, perhaps involving highly derived insect pollinators, already existed at 90 Ma. Given the observed rate of diversification of angiosperms during that time and the pattern of evolution in insects, including what can be inferred about the history of the Apidae, these new floral data suggest that hypotheses relating angiosperm diversity to highly specific pollinators are still valid in the context of fossil evidence. Even so, consistency with fossil evidence is not necessarily proof of these relationships. In any case, there may well be multiple causes of relatively high angiosperm species diversity and understanding the relative importance of each of these requires neontological as well as paleontological investigations. One promising approach is to work within the context of phylogenetic patterns with more fossil data. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029729689

Pollen limitation was only detected in D. hispida.

The pollen of D. hispida and D. uncinata overlapped on the heads of bees suggesting that interspecific pollinations may be responsible for lowered fruit-set in D. hispida.

By this measure, 31 species (43%) were oligolectic (relatively specialized to pollen source) at the level of plant tribe, plant subfamily, or plant family. Exclusive pollen sources of these bees throughout their geographic ranges are flowers of the Cardueae (Compositae), the Asteroideae (Compositae), the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Lamioideae (Labiatae), the Nepetoideae (Labiatae), the Dipsacaceae, or the Campanulaceae. Thirteen species (18%) were found to exhibit a strong, but not exclusive, preference for the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Labiatae, the Cardueae (Compositae), and Zygophyllum (Zygophyllaceae), respectively, while 25 species (35%) proved to be more markedly polylectic, visiting the flowers of up to 17 different plant families for pollen. The plants exploited by three species (4%) are insufficiently known. By far the most important pollen sources of the anthidiine bees as a whole are the Compositae (41.7%) followed by the Leguminosae (23.1%) and the Labiatae (13.0%). The phylogenetic relationships of the anthidiine bees were estimated by a cladistic analysis based on 115 characters to trace possible evolutionary patterns of diet composition. Based on the estimated phylogeny, at least eight shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa and six transitions between oligolecty and polylecty appear to have occurred. Four transitions were from oligolecty to polylecty whereas two transitions are of unknown direction, both directions being equally parsimonious. Assuming that the ancestral state in the anthidiine bees was oligolectic, the present distribution of oligolectic and polylectic species can be explained solely by switches from the oligolectic to the polylectic habit and by shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa. Three of four transitions from oligolecty to polylecty are accompanied by a reduction in bee body size. The significance of this size reduction with respect to the polylectic habit is discussed. The oligolectic anthidiine species visit significantly fewer flower species for pollen during a single foraging bout than the polylectic species. On average, 1.4 plant species were recorded in the loads of specialists compared to 2.2 for generalists. Two monophyletic groups of bees belonging to the genus Anthidium are equipped with a pollen-collecting apparatus consisting of specialized hairs localized either on the face or on the underside of the thorax. It is used to remove pollen from the raised anthers of flowers of the Labiatae and the Scrophulariaceae and to brush pollen from the flat inflorescences of some Compositae, respectively. The observation of flower-visiting females of several anthidiine species revealed that pollen uptake is far from an accidental process. Basic pollen-harvesting techniques have reached a high degree of efficiency: females of a given bee species worked flowers of a certain plant species in a fixed manner, the structures used for pollen uptake from the same flower type were found to be largely the same among anthidiine bees of different taxonomic groups, and no distinct differences with respect to the basic pattern of pollen removal from flowers of the same architecture were obvious when comparing oligolectic and polylectic species. On the other hand, polyleges showed a high intraspecific flexibility regarding the organs used for pollen uptake from flowers of a different architecture.",Anthidiine phylogeny; Apoidea; Host-plant specializations: Megachilidae; Oligolecty; Pollen-foraging strategies; Pollen-harvesting behavior; Polylecty; Western palearctic anthidiini,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030390253

A-4.6%/B-0.0%; birch (Betula sp.) 10.6/14.2; ash (Fraxinus sp.) 3.7/1.1; maple (Acer sp.) 1.8/0.35; hazel (Corylus sp.) 6.0/0.9; linden (Tilia sp.) 1.2/0.1; goldenrod (Solidago sp.) 9.6/0.15; alder (Alnus sp.) 7.5/6.1; poplar (Populus sp.) 7.2/6.5; grasess (Gramineae) 52.2/9.7; rye (Secale cereale) 51.8/1.7; willow (Salix sp.) 2.2/1.3. We conclude that allergy to particular airborne pollen is not related to its concentration. This disproportion is probably the result of: (1) customs of Polish population - in the period of tree pollination patients tend to stay indoors due to low temperatures characteristic of early spring; (2) the period of high (over 50 pollen grains/m3) atmospheric concentrations of strong allergens (as grasses) was long in the regions inhabited by pollinosis patients; (3) cross reactivity between particular airborne allergens.",Aerobiology; Allergy; Epidemiology; Hay fever; Poland; Pollen count; Pollen exposure; Pollinosis; Skin prick test; Warsaw,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007951445

Since this species shows no abortion of fruit between initiation and ripening (although many fruit are eaten by insects), any effect of pollen supply or resource availability limiting fruit production will be most apparent at fruit initiation. 2 Variation in visitation by bats, the pollinators of this species, was correlated with fruit initiation. A survey of pollen loads on 642 bat-visited female flowers revealed, however, that pollen transfer by bats was frequently ineffective. Even after bat visitation, 46% of flowers remain unpollinated. 3 Controlling the supply of pollen to inflorescences at two levels (155 flowers vs. 50 flowers per inflorescence) revealed that the number of fruit initiated per inflorescence is significantly affected by pollen supply. At the high level of controlled hand-pollination the median number of fruit initiated per infructescence was almost five times greater than in the naturally pollinated population. 4 Variation in plant size, light availability, and the number of flowering episodes in the previous year, failed to explain any of the variation in fruit initiation by the unmanipulated field population, or the hand-pollinated population. The resource environment is, however, important to lifetime reproductive success because of its influence on flowering frequency. 5 To my knowledge, there are no other field studies of reproduction by non-herbaceous perennial plants that examine the effect of independent variation in both pollen supply and the resource environment.",Arecaceae; Fruit set; Plant size; Pollen limitation; Resource availability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029730833

The barrier normally encountered in such hybridization was overcome by enhancing the cross-compatibility of the two species, which was accomplished by synthesizing a unique genotype of common buckwheat. This novel plant was produced by selecting common buckwheat plants that exhibited, at isozyme loci PGM, SKDH and ADH, alleles with similar mobility to those found in tartary and then transferring these alleles to a single plant through six generations of breeding. Ovule culture was used to rescue the 7-10 day old embryos. On the rescue-culture medium 41% of the hybrid embryos formed calli larger than 200 ?m in diameter. Most ceased to grow before reaching 1500 ?m, but four out of 263 cultured ovules continued to grow as callus. One of these differentiated and formed callus with buds and shoots from which cloned plants were produced. The remaining embryos either did not grow at all or formed very small calli. When tartary was crossed with the original gcnotype of common buckwheat, only 22% of the hybrid embryos formed small calli and none differentiated.

There is no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance within either species, and the lack of genetic structure is consistent with the pollination biology of the species - both of which are predominantly moth-pollinated.

The objective of this study was to leam why gram-fill parameters of apical kernels differ from those of mid-ear or basal kernels. We studied the effects of 0, 50, or 100% defoliation at pollination on synthetic maize strains that differed for rate of dry matter accumulation (RDMA). We monitored kernel development at three positions on the ear in field experiments conducted for 3 yr at Fargo, ND. Strains selected for low. random, and high R-nj aleurone color expression from NDSF (AES150 maturity) and NDSC (AES300 maturity) were grown in a completely random experimental design within each year. We sequentially sampled kernels to estimate RDMA, effective grain-filling period (EFPD), lag phase duration (LAGP), and mature kernel weight. Average RDMA and R-nj color intensity (CI) provided estimates of photosynthate availability within defoliation levels and years. We correlated changes in gram-filling parameters among ear positions of kernels with apparent photoassimilate availability. In general, apical<mid-ear<basal mature kernel weights, but complete defoliation reduced the magnitude of these differences. As apparent available photosynthate increased within years and defoliation levels, basal, mid-ear, and apical kernels increased in mature dry weight up to 81.3, 50.7, and 49.2%, respectively. With lower photoassimilate. apical kernels had longer LAGP than mid-ear kernels and longer EFPD than basal kernels, and mid-ear kernels often had higher RDMA than basal kernels. Under stress conditions, apical, unlike basal or mid-ear kernels, compensated for reduced RDMA with longer EFPD. With higher photosynthate supplies, apical kernels had shorter EFPD than basal kernels, and shorter LAGP than mid-ear kernels. Strains selected for lower RDMA responded differently to changes in photosynthate supply than strains selected for high or random RDMA. We believe that the pattern of changes in kernel mass from base to apex of the ear in response to available photsynthate is generally consistent with the theory that an osmotic concentration gradient controls assimilate movement into the kernels.",Grain-filling; Translocation; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343275209

Four regeneration systems were compared: a bulk system (BL) where seeds are collected and treated in bulk, a partial sampling system (PS) where seeds are collected from not all, but some plants in the population with an equal number of offspring being raised from each sampled plant, a single seed system (SS) where accessions are regenerated so that each plant leaves one progeny, and the biparental mating system (BP) of Gale and Lawrence (1984) where plants are pollinated in pairs with one offspring being raised from each of the paired plants, or two offspring from one of the paired plants. It was shown that the relative efficiency of the four systems largely depends on the rate of selfing and that differences in the effective population size of the systems increase with increasing rates of selfing. The SS system gave by far the largest effective population size in regenerating the seed of moderately or highly selfing species. Although the BP system gave the largest effective size for outcrossing species, the SS system, when combined with selfing, gave a much larger effective size. The BL and PS systems were in no case the most effective. Of these two, PS system with a sampling fraction of 50% was as effective as BL, but less effective with a sampling fraction smaller than 50%. Calculations of the maintenance of the allelic diversity, however, revealed that differences between the systems are not appreciably large unless the accessions are regenerated over 10 or more cycles with 50 or fewer plants.",allelic diversity; effective population size; mixed selfing and outcrossing; plant genetic resources; regeneration systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303123

The diet was assessed in four seasons over 12 months by collating large numbers of qualitative feeding observations and by analysis of faeces. Data were also collected on flowering and bark shedding in the forest. Sap feeding accounted for more than 80% of the feeding observations throughout the year. Nectar and pollen of eucalypts and banksias accounted for much of the remainder of the diet although arthropods and honeydew were present in spring and summer. Faecal analysis was based on much smaller sample sizes but confirmed the qualitative result obtained from direct observations. It also revealed the presence of a wide variety of pollen types. Many of these could be attributed to incidental ingestion but at least six rainforest genera were moderately common in faeces, which is consistent with observations of brief and infrequent visits by gliders to these trees. Examination of eucalypt, banksia and other pollen types showed that 60-70% of pollen was devoid of cell contents, supporting earlier suggestions that gliders obtained protein from pollen digestion, but at this site also from harvesting arthropods. This study confirms the dependence of the yellow- bellied glider in north Queensland on the sap of the red stringybark (Eucalyptus resinifera) and that conservation of the yellow-bellied glider is intimately associated with the management of this tree species. The use of various species for nectar and pollen suggests that the yellow-bellied glider may he an important pollinator in these forests. Moreover, sap from the wounds created by gliders is used by a range of other animal species. These observations suggest that the yellow-bellied glider is likely to he a keystone species in the open-forest ecosystems of north Queensland and that it deserves special emphasis in management.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302030

Blank fruits resulted from one of five patterns of ovule degeneration caused by funicle degeneration, embryo sac absence, embryo sac degeneration, lack of pollen tube penetration of the embryo sac, or failure of endosperm cellularisation. Funicle degeneration was the most common cause of blanking and was observed either at the site of pollen tube penetration or at the chalazal end of both pollinated and unpollinated ovules.

Hybridization combines genetically divergent genomes and spawns new forms that apomixis perpetuates. Apomixis is aposporous, facultative, and pseudogamous in the genus, and apomicts are generally polyploid, pollen fertile, and pollinated by generalists. That gene flow actually occurs is empirically evident. As apomixis is genetically dominant over sexuality, hybrids involving at least one apomictic parent are apomictic. Clonal reproduction may thus perpetuate F1 individuals and generate agamospecies. Alternatively hybrids may interbreed and backcross to create hybrid swarms or cross with species other than the parents. In eastern North America, the abundance of published names and general taxonomic confusion in the genus doubtless result at least in part from this interplay of apomixis and hybridization. The roles of apomixis and hybridization in diversification within Amelanchier are examined in light of new data about breeding system of an apomictic, hybrid microspecies, informally named A.

Twelve clones were used to analyse pollen tube growth in the pistils by fluorescence microscopy after both types of pollination. After self-pollination pollen grains germinated and developed pollen tubes but, depending on the clone considered, growth of the tubes was arrested at different levels in the pistils. Three of the twelve clones showed a low frequency (<4%) of pistils with pollen tubes in the micropilar area. When the clones of the same cytotype were cross-pollinated it was observed that more than 75% of the pistils showed pollen tubes in the micropilar area. These results indicate that members of this polyploid complex are self-incompatible. They show a ""weak"" self-incompatibility reaction since early arrest of the pollen tubes at the stigma surface did not occur, but retardation and ultimate arrest of the tubes took place after penetration of the stigma branches and entry into the transmitting tissues of the pistil.

Although this explanation has been generally accepted, alternate explanations have been presented, and recently the 'male function' or 'pollen donation' hypothesis has been sharply criticized. In this paper, we make the distinction between selection on total flower number and on the size of inflorescence units, both of which have been termed 'inflorescence size.' We present an ESS model for the evolution of inflorescence design that considers reproductive success through male and female function. The model predicts that selection will balance the proportional changes in female and male reproductive success resulting from changes in inflorescence-unit size. We conducted a field study of selection on the size of inflorescence units (umbels) by manipulating umbel size and number in a natural population of Asclepias tuberosa, in southeastern Arizona, during two reproductive seasons. We found that the male fitness function reached a maximum at an intermediate umbel size in both years (although not significantly different from the smallest umbel size in either year), whereas the female illness function was highest for the smallest umbel size in one year, but was constant across umbel sizes in the other year. We also found that pollinator visitation rate corresponded well with male, but not female, function, and that between year variation in the male reproductive success of different umbel sizes corresponded with variation in the composition of the pollinator pool. Our empirical results, when inserted in the model, predict ESS umbel sizes similar to those observed in the study population and the species throughout its range.",Asclepias tuberosa; ESS model; inflorescence design; inflorescence size; milkweed; pollen transfer; sexual selection; size-number trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301371

Characters used in the analysis included growth form, corm morphology, a range of floral characters, and capsule and seed features, not before known to vary significantly in this genus. The analysis suggested some surprising evolutionary changes. Notable among these is an apparent reversal of perianth tube length from extremely long to short, a shift corresponding to a change from pollination by long-tongued flies and sphinx moths to pollination by bees and noctuid moths. Another unusual change is a shift in floral organization from zygomorphy to actinomorphy correlated with an acaulescent growth form. The reconstructed phylogeny is used here to assess character evolution and patterns of speciation by comparison of species in terminal clades in the cladograms. The resulting comparisons suggest that speciation in the subgenus is either allopatric or the result of microgeographic differentiation and ecological diversification stimulated by edaphic diversity. Despite the variety of floral forms and pollination syndromes in the subgenus there is no evidence of sympatric or pollinator-driven speciation. Prepollination reproductive isolation appears to be achieved by shifts in pollination syndromes between sphinx moths, two guilds of long-tongued flies, and bees. The remarkable floral divergence that has resulted appears to be a consequence of selection for repeated entry into preexisting pollination guilds. The most important of these pollination guilds are two long-tongued fly guilds in which either Prasoeca (Nemestrinidae) or Moegistorhynchus (Nemestrinidae) and Philoliche (Tabanidae) are pollinators. These two guilds are also likely to have been important in promoting speciation in other genera and families in the southern African flora.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030320235

Stamens can be inserted in pairs as the result of two developmental processes : (a) spatial shifts in the flower caused by the transition of a spiral into a cyclic arrangement of floral parts or (b) dédoublement of complex primordia. The first case is linked with a progressive loss of stamen whorls, ultimately leading to the replacement of all pairs by single stamens. Outer paired stamens are characteristic for polycyclic androecia and are often retained when the upper stamen whorls vanish. The outer pairs may be replaced by petals in some cases or by single stamens in other. The second situation arises by the splitting of complex primordia in two secondary primordia or by the independent initiation of the stamens of a pair. Replacement of single stamens by pairs reflects an increase in the pollination potential and has arisen several times, mainly in relation with oligomerous androecia. The distribution of these two types of stamen pairs on a Dahlgrenogram confirms the existence of two groups. These groups correspond more or less with the presence of the characters polymery and oligomery, proposed by RONSE DECRAENE & SMETS (1987,1993 b, 1995b).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001778081

Phenological observations were made weekly by walking along a 10.5 km trail in the interior and at the forest edges of the Santa Genebra Reserve (SGR). The most species-rich families of climbers were Bignoniaceae (22). Malpighiaceae (17), Sapindaceae (12) and Asteraceae (12). Flowering patterns for woody lianas and herbaceous vines differed. Lianas had two flowering peaks: a minor peak in March in the transition from wet to dry season, and a major peak in October during the transition from dry to wet season. The flowering peak for herbaceous vines was in April. Fruiting of lianas was highly seasonal, with one peak in the late dry season (July-August). Fruiting for vines was less seasonal with a slight peak in March. These differences were consistent with the predominance of wind-dispersed fruits among lianas (72% of species) versus vines (52%). Low rainfall, high leaf fall, and strong winds during the dry season favor wind dispersal. More species of vines (40%) have animal-dispersed seeds than lianas (19%). and most vines fruited during the wet season. Phenological patterns of cumbers and trees and treelets at SGR differed. The life form of lianas and their system of reserve economy may allow them to reproduce during periods unfavorable to trees. Displacement of peak flowering periods of trees and climbers pollinated by bees and small generalist insects may decrease competition for pollen vectors among speaes of these two groups of plants Whereas the fruiting patterns of wind-dispersed trees and climbers at SGR were similar (most species fruiting during the dry season), animal-dispersed trees and treelets fruited throughout the year while animal-dispersed climbers exhibited a pronounced peak in late wet season. The distinct phenological patterns of climbers, generally complementary to those presented by trees, resulted in constant availability of flowers and fruits throughout the year and enhances the importance of this plant group in Neotropical forests.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030434538

In some species, the flowers of inflorescences undergo a temporal colour change corresponding exactly to a change in the reward status. Based on information obtained from the spectral reflection curves of pre-chance and post-chage colours of flower corollas and/or floral guides, it was possible to demonstrate that the colour phase associated with reward closely corresponds to the visual stimuli which trigger behavioural responses of inexperienced flower visitors, and that the colour phase associated with less reward corresponds to visual stimuli less attractive to naïve flower visitors. Reciprocal colour changes were not observed. It is to be assumed that the unidirectionality of floral colour changes is an adaptation of angiosperms aimed at the guidance of first-time flower visitors. Signalling reward to inexperienced flower visitors is an additional function of floral colour changes. The main function of floral colour changes, however, is to provide cues with which the flower visitors can learn to associate one colour phase with reward.","Angiosperms; Colour change, floral colour phase, innate flower detection, colour preference, pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000239380

(ii) How do nectar composition, volume, concentration, and amount of sugar vary throughout the flower lifetime? (iii) How does the plant respond to nectar removal: (iv) What is the breeding system of this species? Flowers last 4 days. There is a predominance of the male function in the first days and of the female function in the last days. Chemical composition of nectar varies throughout the flower lifetime; there is a constant decrease in sucrose along with an increase in glucose. Nectar is secreted during nights, and every secretion period is followed by a cessation interval. After the final cessation, a period of active resorption follows. During the mostly male phase of the flower, nectar has more sucrose than hexose, its secretion is discontinuous, and nectar removal reduces the rate of nectar production. During the mostly female phase, nectar has more hexose than sucrose, its secretion ceases, nectar removal does not affect nectar production, and a resorption period is inferred. Tests for spontaneous autogamy and apomixis were negative. Low fruit set is obtained when autogamous, geitonogamous, and xenogamous hand pollinations are performed on flowers less than 2 days old compared with flowers at least 3 days old (0. 15, and 47% versus 19, 37.5, and 89%, respectively).

Bee-pollination in which pollen is the sole reward is the dominant pollination system. Nectar has been best documented in Syzygium but probably also occurs in other bee-pollinated genera. The most common bee visitors are Apidae: Meliponinae and Bombinae. Bird- and mammal-pollination occur in Old World Syzygium with nectar as the primary reward. Bird-pollination with petals as the reward occurs in New World Acca and Myrrhinium. General floral morphology is very uniform, while inflorescence types and flowering strategies are very diverse. Stigmas are dry and ovules are anatropous, hemicampylotropous or anacampylotropous and have an outer 2-6-layered integument and an inner 2-layered integument or a single integument. The ovary usually contains more ovules than will form seeds. Flowering strategies vary from mass-flowering types, in which the flowering episode typically takes only a few days, to steadystate types of up to 90 days duration. Flowering at dry/wet season transition is common in seasonal climates, and fireinduced flowering is found occasionally. Outbreeding is probably widespread, although both self-compatible and self-incompatible species exist. The self-incompatible species have self pollen tubes penetrating the micropyles, so preferential outcrossing may be maintained by a late-acting mechanism. Cryptic dioecy, in which female flowers have 'mimic' sterile anthers occurs in several genera. Apomixis occurs in Syzygium and this has been reported to be linked to the polyembryony found in this genus. Myrtoid fruits are fleshy berries or drupes, dispersed by birds, bats, and other small mammals. Fruit size, color, texture, and number of seeds are all very variable. Seed coats may be absent to bony, but have a smooth surface. The endosperm is mainly digested by the developing embryo. Early embryology is relatively uniform but final embryo morphology varies widely across the genera.

The present study indicates that pine plantations are not unqualified 'inhospitable seas'. However, the human- assisted dominance of the pines over the indigenous vegetation eliminates many species of the original habitat and reduces the numbers, or the frequency of occurrence, of the remaining species. There were significantly fewer vertebrate-pollinated, indigenous, plant species in the plantation sample than in the mountain fynbos one, and significantly more vertebrate- dispersed, native, plant species. Vertebrate pollinators were infrequently recorded in, or absent from, mature pine plantations. These factors are likely to affect some ecological and demographic processes in the pine plantations, such as vertebrate-mediated pollination, and perhaps the continuity of these processes between large areas of original habitat and indigenous habitat patches in the forestry area. Therefore we suggest that areas of fynbos and riparian forest surrounded by plantations should be considered as 'islands' in an 'inhospitable sea' when considering the zonation and management of indigenous habitat for conservation on forestry estates.",birds; ecological processes; Pine plantations; plants; small mammals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030474129

The highest species richness (up to 130 species) is found in parts of the West Central and East Central rain forest regions, and the lowest richness occurs in the Western Region and on the periphery of the rain forest zone. Rodents and bats contribute the greatest number of species (about 25% each), with lesser numbers of primates, duikers, and small insectivores; the relative numbers within each order is similar in all localities regardless of the composition and total numbers of species. The geographical distribution of each species is due to the alternating periods of forest fragmentation and expansion in the past, and the species-specific response to these environmental changes. There are about equal numbers of arboreal (30%), terrestrial (35%) and aerial (27%) species, each species within these categories having very specific habitat requirements within the forest. Most rain forest mammals are either frugivores (36%) or insectivores (37%): monkeys are mainly arboreal frugivores and folivores, and most prosimians are arboreal insectivores; forest duikers are terrestrial frugivores, and terrestrial rodents are frugivores or omnivores. Leaves, in spite of their abundance, are rarely eaten because of their low nutritive value and the difficulties of digesting them and consequently folivores (9%) are uncommon. Insects form the principal food for insect-bats and shrews. Mammals exhibit well-defined food partitioning in relation to food selection and body size, and therefore competition for food is probably minimal except during the dry season. Reproduction is more or less continuous in rodents and artiodactyls (with peaks of births at selected seasons); in contrast, monkeys and bats have fairly precise periods when births occur, which vary according to the species. The timing of reproductive events is regulated by the rainfall regime, availability of food, and phylogenetic characteristics such as the length of gestation and body size. Mammals interact with other rainforest organisms, principally as primary and secondary consumers, pollinators, and dispersers of fruits and seeds. Most species of rain forest mammals are solitary, but a few live in monospecific groups or in polyspecific groups. Forest disturbance in recent years (especially forest clearance and hunting) has had very detrimental effects on the geographical distribution and numbers of individuals of all species of forest mammals.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749272974

The deduced amino acid sequence contains two regions characteristic of the active sites for PDI and a carboxyl-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu. Southern blot analysis indicated the maize PDI is encoded by a single gene that maps to the short arm of chromosome 4. When isolated from the cisternal and protein body ER, the PDI protein resolves into a fast and a slow form on SDS-PAGE. During endosperm development, the PDI RNA level increases between 10 and 14 days after pollination. In floiiry-2 (fl2) endosperm, which contains an abnormally processed a-zein protein, PDI expression is significantly increased, and the level of PDI protein and RNA is positively correlated with the dosage of fll alleles. The increase of PDI in fll occurs mainly in the cisternal ER fraction, whereas the most dramatic increase of binding protein (BiP) is in the protein body ER. We propose that the induction of PDI in the fl2 mutant reflects its role as a molecular chaperone, and that PDI functions in concert with BiP at different stages of zein processing and assembly into protein bodies. © 1996 Klüver Academic Publishers.",Binding protein; Floury-2; Maize endosperm; Molecular chaperone; Protein disulfide isomerase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030099075

Mating system strategies differ between the two species in the populations examined. High pollen : ovule ratio, high seed : ovule ratio, good autodeposition ability, and unpredictable pollination in concert with self-incompatibility indicate that P. hookeriana in the population studied has adopted a more or less pseudogamous mating system. In contrast, the data suggest that P. uniflora in the studied population is approaching a sexual, facultatively outbreeding species. Because both species exhibit ploidy variation, a trait common among agamospermous plants, it is concluded that both species are likely to be facultatively agamospermous but that sexual reproduction is much more important in the population of P. uniflora than it is in P. hookeriana.",Apomixis; Pollen: ovule ratio; Reproductive ecology; Rosaceae; Seed: ovule ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007403565

As such they are likely to play key ecological roles as regulators of invertebrate populations and pollinators of forests. Although somewhat contradictory, current evidence suggest that logging impacts on the species richness and activity of insectivorous bats when forest structural complexity and the number of available roosting hollows are reduced. Inconsistent results concerning impact on species richness stem from methodological problems with bat surveys. ""Rare"" species are often recorded in low numbers, preventing habitat preferences and disturbance impacts from being determined. Radio-telemetry has demonstrated that roosts in hollows of mature trees are a critical resource for many species of bats due to species specific requirements. However, it is not yet possible to state whether bat populations are directly limited by the availability of hollows in areas where a mosaic of logged and unlogged forest exists. Although data on foraging areas are extremely limited, some species appear to be flexible, capable of flying across open areas and exploiting those rich in invertebrates. Some species (e.g., Vespadelus) show a high degree of site attachment, possibly indicating a susceptibility to logging, however, the extent of site fidelity for most species is unknown. As pollinators, megachiropteran bats are likely to play a key role in maintaining the genetic diversity currently present in eucalypts by facilitating long-distance movement of pollen. Areas that are productive in nectar and pollen have a high conservation value for these bats and many other nectarivores, however, the age at which important nectar-producing trees flower is generally not known. The extent to which wildlife prescriptions, such as habitat trees and mosaics of small reserves, mitigate these impacts on bat species requires urgent research.",Bats; Disturbance; Eucalyptus; Flying Foxes; Forestry; Invertebrates; Logging; Tree Hollows,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030319915

Two series of experiments were performed. In the first, symmetric fusion experiments, protoplasts from the two materials were fused without any pretreatments. In the second, asymmetric fusion experiments, X-ray irradiation at doses of 180 and 200 Gy were used to limit the transfer of the L. fendleri genome to the hybrids. X-ray irradiation of L. fendleri mesophyll protoplasts did not suppress the proliferation rate and callus formation of the fusion products but did significantly decrease growth and differentiation of non-fused L. fendleri protoplasts. In total, 128 regenerated plants were identified as intertribal somatic hybrids on the basis of morphological criteria. Nuclear DNA analysis performed on 80 plants, using species-specific sequences, demonstrated that 33 plants from the symmetric fusions and 43 plants from the asymmetric fusions were hybrids. Chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a biased segregation that favoured B. napus organelles in the hybrids from the symmetric fusion experiments. The bias was even stronger in the hybrids from the asymmetric fusion experiments where no hybrids with L. fendleri organelles were found. X-ray irradiation of L. fendleri protoplasts increased the possibility of obtaining mature somatic hybrid plants with improved fertility. Five plants from the symmetric and 24 plants from the asymmetric fusion experiments were established in the greenhouse.

We describe an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method based on wounding of cultured embryogenic tissues with carborundum in liquid phase. Embryogenic tissues were obtained from cultured immature zygotic embryos collected 75-90 days after pollination. The expressible coat protein (CP) gene of a Taiwan strain of papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) was constructed in a Ti binary vector pBGCP, which contained the NPT-II gene as a selection marker. The embryogenic tissues were vortexed with 600 mesh carborundum in sterile distilled water for 1 min before treating with the disarmed A. tumefaciens containing the pBGCP. Transformed cells were cultured on kanamycin-free medium containing 2,4-D and carbenicillin for 2-3 weeks and then on the kanamycin medium for 3- 4 months. The developed somatic embryos were transferred to the medium containing NAA, BA and kanamycin and subsequently regenerated into normal- appearing plants. Presence of the PRSV CP gene in the putative transgenic lines was detected by PCR and the expression of the CP was verified by Western blotting. The transgene was nuclearly inherited as revealed by segregation analysis in the backcrossed R1 progeny. From five independent experiments, the average successful rate of transformation was 15.9% of the zygotic embryos treated (52 transgenic somatic embryo clusters out of 327 zygotic embryos treated), about 10-100 times higher than the available methods previously reported. Thus, wounding highly regenerable differentiating tissues by carborundum vortexing provides a simple and efficient way for papaya transformation mediated by Agrobacterium.",Agrobacterium vector; Coat protein gene; Papaya ringspot virus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030445598

Poncirus trifoliata pollen was also used to provide a morphological marker to compare each seed parent's ability to produce hybrid seedlings. Both Silverhill and Imperial can produce seedless fruits. Methods used to produce and identify hybrids highlighted the relative ease with which either can be used as a seed parent. Imperial mandarin produced more seeds per fruit (mean >8) than Silverhill satsuma (mean <4), thus requiring fewer controlled pollinations to produce desired numbers of hybrids. Germination rates of Imperial-cross seeds were generally greater than for Silverhill-cross seeds. A single seedling emerged from every Imperial-cross seed that germinated, demonstrating the monoembryonic nature of Imperial seeds. All Imperial x P. trifoliata seedlings were hybrids, confirmed by their trifoliate leaves. From this, all seedlings from other Imperial-cross seeds were assumed to be hybrids. By contrast, embryo rescue after in vitro germination demonstrated the polyembryonic nature of the Silverhill-cross seeds. Mean embryo number per Silverhill seed varied from 3.6 to 12.0 between crosses, and from 2 to 30 between seeds within crosses.

All crosses resulted in seed set, except for self-pollination of B. prionotes and interspecific pollination to B. prionotes as the female parent. Mortality of hybrid seedlings was high RAPD analysis of hybrid seedlings from two families showed paternal B. prionotes bands in all 11 tested seedlings. Leaf length or width of nine hybrid seedlings that survived to the 10-leaf stage was intermediate between that of intraspecific seedlings of both parents at the same age. A mature natural interspecific hybrid was fertile following controlled selfing and backcrossing to each parental species, as well as following open pollination, but seed set was lower than for the parental species.

Conversion of natural flood plain forests is the greatest problem in Central Europe. Riverside forests are often planted with hybrid poplars, mainly P. deltoides Marsh. × P. nigra clones. This practice introduces genes of a foreign species, the American black cottonwood (P. deltoides), within the gene pool of P. nigra as there are no apparent crossing barriers between hybrids and native poplars. Effective gene conservation requires reliable genetic markers for introgression. Based on a genetic marker in an American hybrid poplar (P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa Torr. and Gray) F2-pedigree linkage map (BRADSHAW et al. 1994), a simple assay was developed that detects a P. deltoides-specific allele in hybrids with P. nigra. The patterns of inter-and intra-specific polymorphism were investigated by analysing controlled-cross and open-pollinated seeds, and P. nigra trees from native stands. Evidence for the presence of the P. deltoides allele was found in seeds collected in a hybrid plantation, however surprisingly low levels of this allele were detected in areas with native P. nigra trees, though hybrid plantations occur at some distance.",Black poplar; Genetic markers; Hybrid poplars; Introgression; P.

The structure of allelic variation within the populations suggests that sexual reproduction has played a significant role in these C. bigelowii populations, despite present lack of seedling recruitment. The study was carried out in moss-heath communities on Icelandic lava-fields. Two adjacent populations were studied at one site, while a third population was studied at a second site, 35 km away from the first two populations. 2 The number of genets detected in each population, among 85-88 analysed ramets, ranged from 41 to 55 (minimum estimate). Samples were taken every 4 m along transects in the populations. Ramets with the same allozyme genotype were often spatially aggregated. No seedlings have been observed in the populations during five years of demographic studies. 3 All the populations studied showed a diploid expression of allozymes and high levels of allelic variation, with on average 49% polymorphic loci (P), 1.77 alleles per locus (A) and an allelic diversity (HS) of 0.167. Similar levels of within-population variability are found in many wind-pollinated and outcrossing plant species. 4 The difference between observed and expected heterozygosity was small in all populations, suggesting high levels of outbreeding. 5 Comparisons with other Carex taxa show that the levels of and structuring of allozyme diversity in C. bigelowii is similar to that in other outbreeding species (usually rhizomatous), and much higher than in inbreeding species (which are usually caespitose). 6 Only 5% of the total allelic diversity was explained by differences between the two study sites (GST = 0.055), suggesting extensive recent or historic gene-flow.",Breeding system; Clone size; Genetic diversity; Genotypic diversity; Isozyme,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030468478

In the process from pollination to fertilization, a constant reduction in the number of pollen tubes that travel along the style is observed. There could be two main causes of this reduction. One is a physical or physiological constraint consisting of the progressive decrease in the reserves and space available for pollen tube growth along the transmitting tissue of the style, and the other is genetic interaction both among the male gametophytes and between the male gametophytes and the female tissues of the flower. To evaluate the roles that these two forces play in reducing the number of pollen tubes that travel along the style, pistils were subjected to various pollen competition regimes by applying different mixtures of live and dead pollen onto the stigmata. The results obtained were similar when the experiment was repeated with different genotypes over 2 years, both in the laboratory and in the field. The role of stylar constriction is important, but it is not the only cause of pollen tube attrition because with low pollen loads fewer pollen tubes reach the different parts of the style than could fit therein. The fact that under different pollen competition regimes the number of pollen tubes is reduced by the same proportion in each stylar level indicates that genetic interactions play an important role in the control of pollen tube attrition. © Springer-Verlag 1996.",Cherry; Gametophytic competition; Pollen competition; Pollen tube growth; Prunus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001157589

Here, we use two case studies - the Devono-Carboniferous vascular plant radiation and the largely coeval evolution of heterosporous from homosporous life histories - to examine the interface between phylogeny and ecology. Our observations challenge some tenets of the neo-Darwinian orthodoxy, notably the assumed role of competition mediated selection as an active driving force, rather than a passive filter, of evolution. The Devono-Carboniferous class-level radiation of vascular plants was prompted by attainment of a complexity threshold and delimited the morphological envelope that enclosed an apparently fractal pattern of subsequent, lower level radiations. The contrast of low speciation rates with exceptionally high rates of phenotypic divergence in the Devonian suggests a non-adaptive ""novelty"" radiation, perhaps reflecting saltational evolution via ""hopeful monsters"". Successive lower level radiations were more constrained by the ecological hierarchy that resulted from progressive niche differentiation and saturation. This in turn reflected increased speciation rates, thereby completing a well defined negative feedback loop in the coevolution of phenotypic and ecological differentiation. Heterosporous life histories evolved independently in at least ten lineages. Heterospory allows the sporophyte to impose, via differential development, a single fixed gender on each gametophyte prior to spore release. Although the resulting life history is less flexible than homospory, which on recent evidence includes a range of subtle and sophisticated strategies, it promotes the sporophyte as the primary target for selection. Gametophytes effectively perform the role of gametes and are released into the environment prior to fertilization, thus favoring aquatic-amphibious habitats resistant to occupation by homosporous pteridophytes; terrestrial heterospory requires apomixis. Although the profound iteration of heterospory implies a strong adaptive advantage, repeated gradual evolution via inferior intermediates exhibiting exosporous heterospory seems unlikely. Seed-plant success reflects economic efficiency and the subsequent evolution of effective pollination syndromes, rather than integumentation of the ovule. Major radiations of heterosporous lineages and subsequently of seed-plants required perturbation of pre-existing communities by extrinsic environmental changes rather than genuinely competitive displacement. This typical manifestation of ""home-field advantage"" further emphasizes the intimate relationship between phylogeny and ecology, and allows us to make predictions that can be tested by further paleobotanical research. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Genetic differentiation among plant populations over small scales (a few cm to a few hundred cm) has been documented and is reviewed here, in herbaceous annuals and perennials, woody perennials, aquatics, terrestrials, narrow endemics, and widely distributed species. Character differentiation has been documented for most important features of plant structure and function. Examples are known for seed characters, leaf traits, phenology, physiological and biochemical activities, heavy metal tolerance, herbicide resistance, parasite resistance, competitive ability, organellar characters, breeding systems, and life history. Among the forces that have shaped these patterns of differentiation are toxic soils, fertilizers, mowing and grazing, soil moisture, temperature, light intensity, pollinating vectors, parasitism, gene flow, and natural dynamics. The breadth and depth of the evidence reviewed here strongly support the idea that natural selection is the principal force shaping genetic architecture in natural plant populations; that view needs to be more widely appreciated than it is at present.",evolutionary dynamics; genetic variation; microdifferentiation; plants; selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030512864

Seedlings were inoculated with two isolates of H. mammatum, representing high and low aggressiveness, through a stent wound. Beginning 4 days after inoculation, host responses were examined on 312 seedlings per family for a period of 5 weeks on 3- and 9-month-old seedlings. Significant differences in host responses were observed between the two isolates, with the more aggressive isolate allowing less callus format on, causing more tissue necrosis and producing longer cankers than the less aggressive isolate on both aspen families. Between-family difference was much greater than within-family difference for tissue necrosis, callus formation and canker length for both seedling ages. When the 3 month-old seedlings were challenged with H mammatum the PR family showed greater tissue necrosis, longer cankers, and less callus formation than the PS family. However, when the more lignified 9-month-old seedlings of the same families were inoculated, the PR seedlings had much less tissue necrosis, shorter cankers, more callus formation and less seedling mortality than the PS family.

The Burkard volumetric spore trap was used for collecting pollens, which were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. In the paper, 23 allergenic taxa, which appeared in great quantity, were taken into account. Results were expressed in number-of pollens and spores in 1 m3 of air per day, month and year. The following classes of pneumoallergens, concentrations according to probability of appearance of allergic symptoms, were selected: low values - not harmful, mean values - possibility of allergic reaction, high levels - possibility of allergic reaction in all patients, very high levels - noted only for spores possibility of allergic reactions in cell patients. Tree pollens, apart from pine and fir, appeared in low concentrations. Intensive grass pollination has been observed from the end of May to the beginning of July. Weeds, particularly nettle, due to intensive pollination, may be dangerous for allergic patients in July and August. During the whole year fungal spores, mainly Cladosporium, appeared in medium, high and very high concentrations. We have found that during the five-year observation, pollen season started in the period from January to March and lasted 2 to 12 weeks for particular taxa; for fungal spores even longer - a few months. Variability of pollination, as to quantity and regularity, can be explained by changes in climate and vital cycles of flora in natural environment. During the last five years we have found very low prevalence of highly allergenic pollens of trees and grasses in total count of pollens in Rabka.

As there are lingering questions regarding the dominant nature of the nontumour trait, I shall present experimental evidence and theoretical arguments that suggest that the nontumour condition does not necessarily involve a single dominant gene mutation, but rather mutations affecting tumour expression. In the framework of a genetic model of tumour formation in Nicotiana (Ahuja, 1968), the mutations are probably in those ee loci of N. glauca affecting tumour expression, and not in the I element of N. langsdorffii, as previously suggested by Smith (1972) and Sekine et al. (1993). As tumour-prone tissues are highly sensitive to environmental influences, including irradiation, it would be very difficult to obtain a mutation from tumour to a completely nontumour state, as in all likelihood, the irradiation treatments would accelerate tumour formation, or induce variation in the tumour expression. Instead, I propose a different approach for isolating a nontumour mutant, which involves irradiation of haploid cells (pollen) from N. langsdorffii (I species) and then pollinating N. glauca (ee species) with the irradiated pollen. As the cross N. glauca x N. langsdorffii normally yields a 100 per cent tumorous progeny, any deviation from this norm, i.e. a nontumour mutant, would be easily detected in the proposed cross. The reciprocal cross involving irradiated pollen from the ee parent N. glauca may also be attempted to check the validity of the hypothesis. ©1996 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Genetic control; Genetic tumours; Irradiation effects; Nicotiana glauca-langsdorffii; Nontumour mutant; Tumour expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030029286

The proportion of the total genetic diversity found among populations, as indicated by the allozyme data, was 16%. Higher levels of population differentiation were found for differences in leaf shape; population of origin accounted for 37% of the variation in maximum leaf width, while families within populations accounted for 7%. In contrast to many endemic species, L. helleri maintains fairly high levels of genetic diversity.

Biomass and seed yield were more severely affected by inbreeding than the other traits. Significant heterosis was observed for every hybrid and trait.

Samples from over 5500 trees were subjected to artificial freezing and visually evaluated for needle, stem and bud tissue injury. The extent to which cold injury is genetically related to tree height and shoot phenology (timing of bud burst and bud set) was also evaluated. Significant family variation was found for all cold hardiness traits; however, individual heritability estimates were relatively low (ranging from 0.09 to 0.22). Significant family-by-test site interaction was detected for needle injury in the Cascade breeding zone, but not in the coastal zone. Genetic correlations (rA) among needle, stem and bud tissues for cold damage were weak (0.16 ? rA ? 0.58) indicating that genes controlling fall hardening are somewhat different for different tissues. Timing of bud burst and bud set were only weakly correlated with cold injury (rA ? 0.49). Thus, bud phenology is a poor predictor of fall cold hardiness in this species. There was no consistent relationship between tree height and cold injury in the coastal zone. In the Cascade zone, taller trees appeared to be more susceptible to cold injury, but the association was weak (mean rA = 0.38, range 0.20-0.72). © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

In a pot experiment, plants were subjected to two treatments: shading during stem elongation, reducing growth; and climatic stress (low radiation and chilling) at meiosis, inducing pollen sterility. The percentage of grain setting among the two oldest florets within each spikelet (LF) and the ratios of grain number to (i) biomass of the chaff and (ii) biomass of the straw plus chair were markedly reduced by the stress at meiosis and either little or not affected by shading during stem elongation. Two indices were tested in the field: LF and the ratio, RK, of the grain number per ear to an estimate, based on chaff biomass, of the potential number in the absence of sterility. These indices were measured in a network of five field experiments with six cultivars. The fluctuations in the indices were compared to those of a reference criterion that identified sterility: the rate of grain setting among the two oldest florets of each spikelet, measured in bagged cars to prevent cross-pollination. Both indices were reduced when the reference criterion diagnosed a major sterility but they did not always decrease in case of minor sterility. Classification of the cultivars based on the reference criterion was similar to that based on LF, but not on RK. LF diagnosis of sterility was in agreement with the occurrence of climatic conditions likely to induce sterility.",Crop diagnosis; Grain set; Lateral florets; Pollen sterility; Triticum aestivum L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430710

The micropylar tube is sheathed by one or two united pairs of outer envelopes that resemble the inflorescence bracts. Developmentally, Gnetales and angiosperms have in common a circular (inner) integument and its initiation at the time when the sporogenous cells become apparent, whereas the integument is two-lobed and its initiation precedes the differentiation of sporogenous cells in other gymnosperms. However, Gnetales differ from angiosperms in having an acropetal (and not basipetal) initiation sequence for the two inner envelopes, including the integument. The attachment of the two envelopes of the nucellus is at about the same level in most angiosperms, whereas the outer is much lower than the inner in Gnetales. The second or third envelope as counted from the nucellus (the carpel) is the receptive one in angiosperms, while it is always the innermost one (the integument) in Gnetales. In all three genera of the Gnetales bisexual organ complexes occur in various combinations but always with the female organs more apical than the male ones, in Ephedra at inflorescence (rarely flower) level, in Gnetum at partial inflorescence level, and in Welwitschia at flower level. The female organs in these bisexual complexes are often sterile but seem to be regularly functional by secreting a sweet pollination drop that serves as nectar for pollinating insects. In some species of Ephedra and Gnetum that lack female flowers, in the male inflorescences nectar may also be secreted by other parts of the inflorescence. Homologies of the female organ complexes with those of angiosperms are uncertain apart from the nucellus and the (inner) integument. The floral bracts (outer envelopes) may be apomorphic in Gnetales without direct correspondence in angiosperm flowers. The basipetal development of the bisexual complexes in Gnetum is compared with the basipetal development of the ovules in Bennettitales and a similar topology in conifers with several ovules on a seed scale. © 1996 by The University of Chicago.

In the endosperm mutant opaque-2 the level of one zein class is reduced; these kernels exhibit an opaque phenotype instead of the vitreous phenotype displayed in normal genotypes, presumably due to the decrease in total zein protein at the time of desiccation.

However, the endosperm of opaque-2 maize at 14 DAP contains tubular arrays within the rough endosplasmic reticulum. These tubular arrays are tightly associated with the developing protein bodies.

Significant differences might be found in ragweed pollen concentration on days displaying different weather types; most of the anticyclonic situations are favourable for pollination, and all cyclonic situations are unfavourable, probably due to the precipitation caused by fronts. However, a part of the anticyclonic types were also unfavourable. During these types (Aw and AB), cool air masses reach the Carpathian Basin in summer, often forming pseudo cold-fronts and causing heavy showers and a fall in temperature.

This study was undertaken to obtain estimates of genetic parameters for important agronomic traits in two populations (Ribadumia and Tuy) from northwestern Spain. Full-sib within half-sib groups were developed by the Design I mating system and evaluated at two locations in Spain in 1987 and 1988. The populations showed a similar genetic structure with very small differences. Moreover, the pattern of genetic variability was similar to other germplasrn because the greatest proportion of total genetic variance was attributed to additive effects for most traits. In contrast, estimates of dominance variance were large for yield, ear, and plant height and ear length. In general, additive × environment interaction variances were significant while dominance × environment interaction variances were not significant for either population. The large range of variation and the high values of heritability for lodging and ear and kernels traits, as well as values of expected gain from selection for these traits, suggested good potential for improvement through an intrapopulation selection program. However, the large dominance effects and the small additive effects for grain yield indicated that an interpopulation selection program would be effective if the large intrapopulation dominance variance is expressed in population crosses. Yield did not show significant additive variance so estimates of additive correlation with any trait were not calculated. Correlated response between yield and any trait is not expected and improved grain yield based on indirect selection of yield components is not recommended.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001500021

In the closely related plant species Silene alba and S. dioica, flowers are the site of infection by the host-sterilizing anther smut fungus Ustilago violacea, as well as the site of oviposition by the noctuid Hadena bicruris. In diseased populations of the two host species, the noctuid can act as pollinator, fruit predator, and vector of fungal spores. Hence, host traits that enhance or reduce visitation rates by the noctuid could affect fruit set, fruit predation and infection probability. A field study was conducted to investigate the magnitude and direction of effects of the timing of anthesis on reproductive success via these pollinator-mediated processes. More than 50% of the Silene fruits produced in a sympatric population of S. alba and S. dioica were predated by the noctuid. Predation was two times higher in S. alba than in S. dioica, innihilating the two times higher flower and fruit production by the former species. This finding emphasizes the potential impact of biotic factors on the relative fecundity of related plant species in natural populations. Onset of flowering was 4 - 8 weeks earlier in S. dioica than in S. alba. In S. dioica, early flowering individuals produces the largest fraction of undamaged fruits per flower because of their high fruit set, and their low rates of fruit abortion and predation. By contrast, in S. alba, late flowering individuals produced the highest fraction of undamaged fruits per flower, because of a monotonic decrease in fruit predation with time and the absence of a significant impact of phenology on fruit set. In principle, pollinator-mediated selection could thus favour earlier flowering plants in S. dioica and later flowering plants in S. alba, and an evolutionary response to such selection would increase the average difference in onset of flowering between the two species. However, differences in fitness among phenology classes were more strongly determined by differences in flower production per plant than by differences in the average reproductive success per flower. A response to pollinator-mediated selection is therefore only expected if effects of age, size, or other factors that determine differences in flower production per plant are averaged out over progeny. In both host species, ca 20% of the hosts only produced sterile flowers as a result of systemic infection by the fungal pathogen U. violacea. In S. alba, the impact of phenology on fungal infection was in the same direction as for fruit predation (decreasing with later onset of flowering). In S. dioica, phenology had no effect on the probability of infection. In both species, associations between infection and predation tended to be positive but were not statistically significant, suggesting that the presence of alternative vectors or variation in resistance unrelated to traits affecting vector contact may prevent a tight association between damage caused by a vector-herbivore and its vectored disease.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303325

These plants form seeds via agamospermy. An embryological study of two agamospermous strains revealed embryos that developed from unfertilized cells of embryo sacs before pollination. The agamospermous seedlings had diploid chromosome sets and were segregated by marker locus Rr (red hypocotyl), which controlled hypocotyl pigmentation in seedlings. The ratio between the frequencies of two seedling phenotypes was 11:3; i.e., it was equal to that of the gametic frequencies in the case of disomic segregation in duplex heterozygotes (RRrr). A conclusion was drawn that, in the studied strains, the archespore complex was a mixoploid cell population containing diploid and tetraploid cells. Embryo sacs with unreduced (diploid) chromosome sets were formed from tetraploid cells; these embryo sacs were prone to parthenogenetic development. It was revealed that the rate of self-fertility was almost the same in pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile plants. However, the proportion of plants that set seeds when their floral shoots were isolated from alien pollen was significantly higher in pollen-fertile beets. It is probable that, in self-incompatible, pollen-fertile plants, some seeds are also formed via agamospermy. An explanation is suggested for the drastic increase in the proportion of self-fertile plants that was revealed in beet populations grown at a low temperature in the late 1930s [3]; it is suggested that agamospermous embryos (which appear regularly in any population) have a greater possibility of completing embryogenesis at a low than at a high temperature because of higher embryonic mortality in the latter case.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040474538

Using simple linear regression, realized genetic gains were estimated by comparison among these groups and also by comparison of improved materials to unimproved materials (called CHECK) included in most tests. On a region-wide basis, the ranking of realized gain ratios tin percent above unimproved material) for volume and rust of the 5 groups corresponded exactly to the order predicted by a priori classification based on the BLP predicted BVs. For example, for volume the realized gain increased linearly for the 5 volume groups. Regression analyses were used to examine how age and site characteristics (e.g., site index, rust hazard) and their interactions with the 2 types of genetic groupings (V1 to V5, R1 to R5) affected genetic gains in the 2 traits, volume and rust. Age was almost never significant for volume or rust suggesting that the percentage gain above unimproved material is constant over the range of ages 5 to 11. The results also suggest that superior families for tree volume express increased gain in volume (on a % basis) compared to the unimproved material on better quality sites, and that genetic differences among genetic groups are greater on better sites (SI class 3, 4 and 5) relative to poorer sites (SIclass 1 and 2).

A wide hybridization program was conducted from 1990 to 1994 in Germany to determine the prospects for sexual gene transfer or haploid production in oat (Avena sativa L.). Five cultivars of oat were pollinated with pearl millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke], eastern gamagrass [Tripsacum dactyloides (L.) L.], and maize (Zea mays L.; 2x and 4x) in the greenhouse. Exogenous auxin application, embryo rescue, and early colchicine-mediated doubling of chromosomes were used to overcome postzygotic barriers. The recovered plants were analyzed cytologically and phenotypically under greenhouse and field conditions. Depending on the pollinator species, the embryo frequencies varied from 0.4% (Z. mays 4x) to 9.8% (pearl millet). In embryo rescue, initial growth occurred frequently, but many plantlets died. Chromosomes of the pollinator species were lost late in embryo and plant development. One to four chromosomes of the pollinator species were found at the tillering stage in root tip cells. Overall, four viable plants were produced, among them hybrids with pearl millet and eastern gamagrass for the first time. The efficiency of haploid production (<0.1%) was too low in all combinations for application in plant breeding programs; however, the transfer of genes or chromosomes appears promising in crosses of oat with maize and pearl millet.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030059103

The content of phenolic metabolites in oregano and related species are highly variable due to genetic heterogeneity. This genetic heterogeneity is due to the breeding character being influenced by natural cross-pollination. In order to develop gene pools to improve ingredient quality and quantity genetically uniform shoot-based clonal lines were isolated using plant tissue culture techniques. Clonal lines were generated from multiple shoots induced by 1 mg/l benzylaminopurine in standard Murashige and Skoog medium with 3 % sucrose. Under these optimum conditions 7-10 shoots per explant were generated for further clonal propagation or regeneration of plants. Shoot-inducing hormones like thidiazuron and adenine sulfate did not improve multiple shoot-forming ability. Individual shoots of several individual clonal lines with each originating from a single heterozygous seed were then inoculated with a novel Pseudomonas sp. Following 30 days of growth on hormone-free Murashige and Skoog medium, morphology, tolerance to Pseudomonas, phenolics and rosmarinic acid content were measured and compared to uninoculated controls in 7 clonal lines of oregano. Results indicate that Pseudomonas sp.-mediated stimulation of phenolics and rosmarinic acid in various oregano clonal lines were directly correlated to tolerance to Pseudomonas sp.. Among these clonal lines, OM-1 had the highest increase in phenolics and rosmarinic acid with corresponding enhanced tolerance to Pseudomonas sp.. This provides an unique strategy to isolate high phenolics-producing, genetically uniform clonal lines using Pseudomonas sp.. From a basic research perspective such clonal lines are essential for characterization of biochemical pathways of specific phenolic metabolites. From an applied research perspective, selection of elite clonal lines serve to provide extracts with uniform phenolic ingredients for use as antioxidants and antimicrobials in food systems.

In this context, quantitative estimates of 2n-pollen formation were made in two type of diploid potato populations. One population set consisted of the progeny from diallel crosses of five well-known diploid potato clones (A = US-W 5293.3, B = US-W 5295.7, C = US-W 5337.3, D = US-W 7589.2 and E = 772102- 37).

It was observed that the behaviour of the parental clones with respect to 2n-pollen grains formation in different environments, such as in Europe and China, was stable. The correlation coefficient between means of 2n-pollen grains frequency of combinations and percentage of genotypes with more than 5% 2n- pollen grains in a given combination were estimated and that between mean and maximum frequency of 2n-pollen grains formation in each combination. The results showed that the former coefficients were significant whereas the latter were not. The combining ability analysis revealed variation in 2n- pollen grains formation between families. Specific combining ability (SCA) effects contributed much more than general combining ability (GCA) to the variation in 2n-pollen grains formation. The broad-sense heritability of 2n- pollen grains formation was estimated to vary between 0.45 and 0.53 and the narrow-sense heritability was calculated to be 0.15 and 0.20 in the two types of populations. This means that additive variance was relatively low. Two to four genes were estimated to control the inheritance of 2n-pollen grains formation.",combining ability; diallel cross; diploid potato; heritability; Solanum tuberosum; unreduced gametes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030458437

Most prior reports indicate that male flowers have larger petals than female flowers. In this article we examine hypotheses regarding patterns of perianth (sepals and petals) size dimorphism. (1) Developmental associations between the corolla and the stamens constrain the independent evolution of these characters. (2) The role of the perianth in enclosing the reproductive structures in the bud results in a correlation between the size of the enclosed structures and the perianth parts. (3) In animal-pollinated species, the perianth serves to attract pollinators; fitness gains achieved through allocation to attractive structures differ between the sexes. To test these hypotheses, we compared 919 species with unisexual flowers; quantitative measurements of floral parts were made for 84 of these species. Unlike most previous studies, this study found that the petals of male flowers were larger than those of females in less than one-half of the cases, demonstrating that developmental associations are not strictly responsible for patterns of sexual dimorphism. Relative perianth size appears to be evolutionarily labile, even within genera. Patterns of perianth-size dimorphism differed between temperate and tropical species and between animal- and wind-pollinated species. Perianth size was strongly associated with the size of the reproductive structures enclosed in each flower, suggesting that the function of petals and sepals to protect developing reproductive structures may determine their size.

The hexaploid cytotype showed irregular meiotic behavior with about one third of the chromosomes associated as multivalents and reproduced by aposporous apomixis.

A significant level of heterogeneity in reproductive traits was present in our sample. Mating was nonrandom as a consequence of complete self- incompatibility (intrafloral and geitonogamous pollinations were unsuccessful) linked with partial cross-compatibility (some inter-individual pollinations consistently failed to produce offspring while other parental combinations were fecund).

Since 1970, biparental mass selection for prolificacy has been carried out in the open-pollinated maize population Golden Glow. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the direct and correlated responses to 20 cycles of mass selection for prolificacy in Golden Glow, and (ii) relate changes in prolificacy to the population's performance at different plant population densities. Yield trials were conducted in 1993 at Madison and Arlington, WI, and in 1994 at Madison, Arlington, and Hancock, WI. In each location and year, the trials were grown at four plant population densities: 28 889 plants ha-1; 44 444 plants ha-1; 57 778 plants ha-1; and 73 333 plants ha-1. Ears per plant increased by 3.3% per cycle, from an average of 0.98 ears plant-1 for C0 to 1.63 ears plant-1 for C20. Grain yield per plant and grain yield per hectare both increased by 1% per cycle, from 126.5 g plant-1 and 5.91 Mg ha-1 for C0 to 151.9 g plant-1 and 7.16 Mg ha-1 for C20. Days to midpollen, days to midsilk, silk delay, and grain moisture decreased across cycles of selection. Root lodging decreased while stalk lodging did not change. Number of ears per plant was significantly and positively correlated with both grain yield per plant (r = 0.71) and grain yield per hectare (r = 0.76).

Two previously described methods, the traditional method and the dilution method, require insect-facilitated cross-pollination of ms ms nuclear male-sterile plants. The traditional method requires a substantial time investment during flowering to remove fertile siblings, and the dilution method requires a substantial amount of land and pollen-parent seed. Because time, land, and seed are limited, a more efficient method would be valuable. The cosegregation method was developed, utilizing close genetic linkage between the W1 locus and the Ms6 locus. The W1 _ seedling has a purple hypocotyl; the w1 w1 seedling has a green hypocoty1. The ms6 ms6 plant is male sterile and female fertile. Approximately 97% of the purple-bypocotyl seedlings, W1 _, in a line segregating for the w1 and ms6 alleles in coupling phase will be fertile, Ms6 _, and can be removed as a pollen source at the first-trifoliolate stage. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the three methods of hybrid soybean seed production for seed yield, efficiency, and hybrid seed purity and quality. We used a randomized complete-block design (three replications per location, three locations, two years). The cosegregation method gave higher seed yield, better efficiency, and equal or better seed quality (percentage germination, 100-seed weight) than the other methods. Male-sterile plants yielded an average of 28.6 seeds plant-1 with the cosegregation method, 18.2 seeds plant-1 with the traditional method, and 9.5 seeds plant-1 with the dilution method. The cosegregation method will be useful in several research areas, including genetic control of complex traits, prediction of parental value, recurrent selection, and commercialization of hybrid soybean.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030484396

Seed of F 2 and F 3 progeny of F 1 hybrids between a salt- tolerant (PI 174263) and a salt-sensitive (UCT5) tomato cultivar were evaluated for germination response at three stress levels of 100 (low), 150 (intermediate), and 200 mM (high) synthetic sea salt (SSS). At each salt- stress level, the most tolerant individuals, as determined by the germination speed, were selected. Selected individuals (F 2s or F 3s) were grown to maturity and self-pollinated to produce F 3 and F 4 progeny families. The selected progeny from each experiment were evaluated for germination at four treatment levels of 0 (nonstress), 100, 150, and 200 mM SSS and were compared with unselected populations. The results indicated that selections were equally effective at all three salt-stress levels and in F 2 and F 3 generations and significantly improved seed germination of progeny under salt-stress and nonstress treatments. Estimates of realized heritability for rapid germination under the various salt-stress levels ranged from 0.67 to 0.76. Analysis of response and correlated response to selection indicated a genetic correspondence of up to 100% between germination at different salt- stress levels. Genotypic family correlations between germination at the low, intermediate, and high salt-stress levels ranged from 0.67 to 0.89, and those between nonstress and salt-stress conditions ranged from 0.25 (between 0 and 200 mM) to 0.71 (between 0 and 100 mM salt). The results indicated that similar or identical genes with additive genetic effects contributed to rapid germination response of tomato seeds at different salt-stress levels. Thus, selection at one stress level resulted in progeny with improved germination at diverse salt-stress levels.

Despite the horticultural importance of M. sieversii, little is known about genetic variation in this species. In this study, allozyme diversity at 18 loci was determined for 259 seedlings belonging to 31 sib families, each consisting of the set of offspring from a different open-pollinated maternal (seed) parent. Maternal parents belonged to 14 populations from four geographic regions. Genetic diversity statistics were computed from the resulting allele and phenotype frequencies. Cluster analysis of sib families showed that there was some grouping based on geographic region, but 16 of the sib families were most closely related to sib families from other regions. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 85% of the enzyme variability was due to differences among sib families within populations and 15% was due to differences among regions. No variability could be assigned to differences among populations within regions. In addition, no alleles were found that were fixed in a region and unique to that region. These results suggest that plants belonging to M. sieversii effectively form a panmictic population. Consequently, a thorough sampling of a few large populations will efficiently capture most of the genetic diversity present in wild M. sieversii.",analysis of molecular variance; apple; cluster analysis; isozymes; Nei's genetic identity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030464798

The fertilization efficiency hypothesis predicts that larger plants produce larger seeds if the number of pollen grains captured by a plant increases with increased allocation of resources to its attractive structures (e.g., corolla and nectar), but with diminishing gains. Thus, seed size should depend on plant size in seeds from CH flowers because of the diminishing gains of capturing pollen in these flowers, whereas seed size should not depend on plant size in seeds from CL flowers because CL flowers need not capture outcross pollen. We found significant positive correlations between mean seed size per plant and plant size for seeds from CH flowers in both species. However, there was no significant positive correlation between two factors for seeds from CL flowers of both species.

Here, the transmitting tissue consists of special epidermal cells, whose granular or floccular secretions provide the selective medium for the growth of pollen tubes. The ovarian self-incompatibility (SI) is widespread within the genus, resulting in it partial or complete suppression of self-fertilization. Moreover, post-zygotic SI mechanisms, as well as postzygotic mechanisms of unknown nature, seem to be recurrent and both are responsible for seed abortion.

This was accomplished by counting fluorescent-stained pollen tubes in flowers with and without fruits in 21 populations, and in flowers subject to either supplemental or sparse pollination, and then determining whether the flowers initiate fruits. There was a conspicuous variation in mean pollen lubes per flower (3-38) and in percent fruit-set (17%-92%) among populations. Neighboring populations often differed strikingly in these respects. Flowers with fruits had an average of 15.2 pollen tubes per stigma whereas those without had an average of 3.7 tubes. Over all flowers, there was a mean of 3.7 tubes per ovule. There was a strong correlation between mean tube number within populations and their percent fruit-set (r = 0.86). Supplemental pollination significantly enhanced fruit-set, thereby supporting the notion that fruit-set was pollen-limited in most populations. In both natural and artificial pollinations a portion of flowers without fruits still had several pollen tubes. The occurrence of fruitless flowers containing tubes is explained by attrition factors, like late acting pollen-pistil incompatibility, and resource limitation. Fruit-set could be initiated with one pollen tube, but this rarely occurred in nature. Higher pollen loads were accompanied by higher percents of fruit-set and number of seeds per flower.","Microgametophytes, pollen tube numbers, fruit-set; Polemoniaceae, Phlox drummondii; seed-set",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029806104

Embryogenesis in wheat x maize hybrids is different from that in self-pollinated wheat plants. Development of the embryo is not accompanied by the formation of an endosperm. The endosperm nuclei remain free in the cytoplasm, fail to advance into the cellular stage, and degenerate at a later time. The antipodal cells quickly degenerate in the fertilized ovaries of wheat x maize hybrids similar to self-pollinated ovaries. The antipodal cells remain normal in unpollinated ovaries. The pre-embryo will abort if it is allowed to develop on the plant, because of a nutritional shortage in the absence of an endosperm. Therefore, embryo rescue is necessary for haploid production from a wheat x maize hybrids. Haploid polyembryos were obtained from spikelet culture of wheat x maize hybrids. The formation of polyembryos is due to the cleavage of the pre-embryo and the effect of 2,4-D. The frequency of haploid embryo production and plant regeneration is affected significantly by maize genotypes, but not by wheat genotypes. The concentration of 2,4-D affects only the size of the embryo.",embryogenesis; haploidy; maize; Triticum aestivum; wheat; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029826608

This was particularly striking at a site with low male flower densities, but fruit set was increased to 100% at that site by confining the floating male flowers within a field enclosure.

Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri is a self-compatible columnar cactus that is visited and pollinated by one species of rare endemic bat, Platalina genovensium, and two species of hummingbirds, Patagona gigas and Rhodopis vesper. W. weberbaueri exhibits pronounced interplant variation in floral color and size, and flowers exhibit traits corresponding to both bat and hummingbird pollination syndromes. Starch-gel electrophoresis of flower bud tissue indicated that W. weberbaueri is an autotetraploid and that genetic diversity (H(cp) = 0.257) of the study population was high relative to diploid plants but similar to other tetraploid species. Initial fruit set from pollinator exclusion experiments conducted in 1991 and 1993, at the onset of and after a drought associated with the El Nino event of 1991-1992, revealed that bats were the most important pollinators in 1991, but that hummingbirds and diurnal insects were most important in 1993. In both years, however, autogamy and lepidopteran larval infestation of fruits reduced differences in mature fruit production among pollinator exclusion treatments so that differences in mature fruit set were not statistically significant. Reduced hat pollination in 1993 is attributed to the reduced abundance of bats at the study site during a drought caused by El Nino. I hypothesize that interaction among several factors, including tetraploidy, autogamy, larval infestation of developing fruits, and variation in pollinator abundance, may not result in strong selection for a bat vs. hummingbird floral morph, thus allowing the persistence of floral variation in this cactus.",Andean habitats; bats; Cactaceae; hummingbirds; Peru; pollination; polyploidy; Weberbauero cereus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301957

A simple pollination model is presented here as a useful tool for understanding the reproductive output of alfalfa and its solitary bee pollinator, Megachile rotundata (Fabr.) (Megachilidae). In particular, the question is raised whether there is a tradeoff between seed yields and bee yields as the number of introduced female bees increases. This question has implications for the management of the alfalfa seed crop. Such a tradeoff requires a maximum bee yield at some optimum number of introduced females, and an increase in seed yields when introduced females increase above the bee yield optimum. Both of these requirements were met if male nectar visits account for a substantial amount of pollination, and if search time is sufficiently slow when open flowers are scarce. Male nectar visits can interfere with reproductive potential of the bee species, creating a bee yield optimum. Slow search times cause seed yields to increase when the number of introduced females is greater than the bee yield optimum.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030319216

Flowering of the C. cave population lasted 39 days, with a peak on the 14th day. During the first 14 days of the flowering period, bumblebees collected pollen (i.e., pollinated), performed the flower spur and robbed the nectar (i.e., primary nectar-robbery). Over the first nine of these days, they perforated the flower spur at random. Then, during the following five days, they learned to locate the nectar and placed most holes in spurs where the surface of the nectar was located. After having perforated most of the flowers, queens changed their behavior to the slightly faster method of secondary nectar-robbing, i.e., using old nectar-robbing holes.

Aconitum septentrionale was also visited by three less abundant generalist bumblebees. Bombus consobrinus was also visiting a few other plants before and after flowering of A. septentrionale. Workers of specialist and generalist bumblebees removed similar amounts of pollen per visit. Queens of the specialist species removed less than worker bees. Flower visit duration was the same for queens as for workers of the specialist. However, both workers and queens of the specialist made shorter visits and thus removed more pollen per unit time than did the two most frequent generalists. Thus the specialist showed a higher efficiency (net energy gain per unit time) as a harvester than the generalists. The proportion of the total pollen production removed by the specialist was similar to that found in other mutualism studies. The proportion of the variation in amount of pollen left in a flower after a visit that could be explained by the combined effects of total pollen production per flower and flower visit duration was less for B. consobrinus than for the two most frequent generalists and also less than seen in other comparable studies in the literature. Workers of B. consobrinus were the only abundant depositors of pollen in flowers of A. septentrionale. Visit duration to female phased flowers explained most of the variation in number of pollen deposited on stigmas. 1% of total pollen production reached conspecific stigmas. Thus B. consobrinus was the only quantitatively important pollinator of A. septentrionale.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302135

A quadratic discriminant function in combination with a cross-validation method found that resource levels correctly classified 77.5% of the violet points and 55.2% of the random points. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated that phosphorus concentrations and tree canopy openness were significantly higher at the violet points than at the random points.

When this is the case, variation in average pollen tube growth rates can potentially affect the number of seeds sired by a given plant. Despite considerable interest in effects of postpollination processes on male fitness, little is known about the extent of variation in pollen performance among plants from natural populations. To examine this question in Hibiscus moscheutos (rose mallow), we conducted mixed-donor hand- pollination experiments with 39 pollen donors bearing distinctive isozyme markers. Pairs of competing donors were compared on sets of 11 to 15 recipient plants per pain. These donors often differed in the proportions of seeds they sired, with the maximum deviation from an expected ratio of 50:50 being 68:32. Furthermore, three intensively studied plants exhibited consistent trends in relative pollen performance when each was tested against (1) the same three competitors, and (2) groups of 14 competitors chosen at random from the study population. In a separate experiment, we investigated the effects of salinity stress and high soil nutrients on pollen performance. These environmental factors had anticipated effects on leaf production, flower production, and petal length, but style length and (most importantly) the number of seeds sired relative to a standard pollen donor were not affected. In summary, this study provides the strongest evidence to date that pollen-tube competitive ability varies among coexisting plants and may be an important component of male fitness in plants.",Environmental stress; gametophytic selection; genetic marker; male fitness; nonrandom fertilization; paternity; pollen-tube competition; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659223

Two such lines were further studied. The presence of the transgene was verified and its expression was followed at intervals. All plants that were resistant to TYLCV at 4 weeks postinoculation (wpi) contained detectable amounts of transgenic mRNA and protein at the time of infection. Resistance was overcome in a few plants at 9 wpi, and in most at 15 wpi. Infection of leaf discs derived from transgenic plants showed that expression of the transgene correlated with a substantial reduction of viral DNA replication. Cotransfections of tobacco protoplasts demonstrated that inhibition of viral DNA replication requires expression of the truncated Rep protein and suggested that the small ORF C4, also present in our construct, plays no role in the resistance observed.

We considered whether this second form of competition might occur among pollen grains of wild radish in two experiments. In the first, interference likely occurred because the amount of pollen germination was less in mixed-donor than in single-donor pollinations. This result was duplicated in a second experiment, which also showed that interference occurred only when pollen grains from different donors were in direct contact with each other. In addition, in the second experiment, the opportunity for interference affected the frequency of seeds sired by different pollen donors.

Using diagnostic isozyme markers, the frequency of hybrid progeny was examined at the level of the whole fruit and separately for the top and bottom halves of fruits. In both species, the proportion of hybrid seeds per fruit increased significantly with increasing head starts, suggesting that differences in pollen tube growth rates affect the frequency of hybridization. In I. fulva fruits, the increase in hybrid seeds occurred ill both halves of the fruits, but in I. hexagona an increase was only detected in the top half of fruits.

Caulophyllum thalictroides var. thalictroides experienced consistently higher reproductive success, measured as both fruit set and seed set, than did C. t. var. giganteum. Self-pollination resulted in 25% seed set in C. t. var. thalictroides and only 3.5% seed set in C. t. var. giganteum. Reciprocal intervarietal crosses produced ten times more seed with C. t. var. thalictroides as female parent than when C. t. var. giganteum was the female parent (81% vs. 8%, respectively). Differences in reproductive biology and the observed unilateral incompatibility may account for differences in seed set between the two varieties and may function as barriers to intervarietal hybridization during overlapping flowering times. This closely related, sympatric taxon pair may be useful in studying both the evolution of differences in reproductive characteristics and the effects of changes in reproductive characteristics on population-level phenomena.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030445686

A total of 90 putative hybrid embryos were rescued using a highly enriched B5 medium to nourish the newly dissected embryos. The growing embryos were then placed in a high osmotic, modified B5 medium to induce maturation and dormancy. Schenk and Hildebrandt medium was used to germinate the dormant, partially dehydrated, physiologically mature embryos. Approximately 37% of the rescued embryos developed into plantlets in vitro, and approximately 8% grew into mature plants in the greenhouse. Morphological, cytological and isoenzyme patterns confirmed the hybrid status of all seven mature plants, all of which were generated using G. tomentella G 9943 as the paternal parent. It was observed that all soybean lines crossed with G 9943 were capable of producing mature hybrid plants. There was no correlation between the initial size of Group 2 seeds and plant survival rate.

It is annual and very sporadic in occurrence but when it is found it is often locally abundant. The inflorescences have mostly unisexual flowers with females borne below the males. Experiments have shown W. triandra to be amphimictic and self- compatible. Pollination can take place without a biotic vector. It is likely that it is highly inbreeding in spite of having unisexual flowers. The nutlets are very hard and have lateral gas-filled invaginations which provide short-lived buoyancy. The seeds have a dormancy induced by the testa (or perhaps the pericarp) which can be broken by mechanical, physical and chemical scarification. Dormancy is an important survival strategy, preventing seeds from germinating after showers during the dry season. The nutlets are dispersed over short distances by water. A mechanism for dispersal over long distances is unknown; the nutlets are digested by Anas platyrhynchos L. and are unlikely to be carried externally on water birds because they are hydrophobic, globose and rather heavy. Germination is typical for the family (with 'Haarkranz' and suppressed primary root) except that the hypocotyl emerges through a clearly demarcated cap. Plants growing in and out of water show a marked heteroblastic leaf development, the 'juvenile' leaves are strap-shaped while the 'mature' leaves are clearly differentiated into petiole and blade. In 1993 we were able to study two populations. Although the two populations were about 160 km apart, no convincing inter- or intra-population variation was detected using morphological characters and eight isozyme systems. Today, W. triandra is found only in habitats modified or maintained by man; the original habitat is discussed. Although rare it is not threatened with immediate extinction but is very susceptible to change in land usage and should be placed in the 'vulnerable' category.",Dispersal; Ecology; Establishment; Germination; Isozymes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030251119

The ribonuclease polymorphism could be correlated with the reported S allele constitutions of the cultivars. Three ribonuclease bands were identified that each consistently corresponded to one of the six known incompatibility alleles (S1, Se and S6), a fourth band apparently corresponded to S3 and to the combination of S4 and S5, and a fifth band to S4 and S5 in other combinations. Thus, it seems that S alleles of cherry have ribonuclease activity and that IEF is useful for distinguishing S allele constitutions. The ribonuclease pattern of 'Summit', a cultivar of unknown incompatibility group, indicated its incompatibility genotype to be S1S2, and this was confirmed by controlled pollination.

In the monoecious fig/pollinator wasp mutualism, each female flower produces either a seed or a pollinator offspring (which has fed on a single seed). Pollen from a syconium (i.e. fig, a closed urn-shaped inflorescence) is only dispersed by female pollinator offspring born in this syconium. Thus the fig tree is selected to produce both seed and pollinator offspring whereas for the pollinator there is no short term advantage in seed production. Using controlled pollination experiments (pollen injection, and foundress introduction), we show that 1) The relative proportion of seeds and pollinator offspring produced (i.e., the effective allocation between female and mule function) depends mainly on the number of foundresses that entered the syconium. 2) Many female flowers within every syconium mature neither a seed nor a wasp (from 25% to 33%). 3) All the female flowers within u syconium that are not vacant at maturity have the potential to produce a seed, and at least 80% of them can produce a pollinator.

Box 40, 6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","It is often assumed that host specialization is promoted by trade-offs in the performance of parasites on different host species, but experimental evidence for such trade-offs is scant. We studied differences in performance among strains of the anther smut fungus Ustilago violacea from two closely related host plant species, Silent alba and S. dioica, on progeny of (1) the host species from which they originated, (2) the alternative host species, and (3) inter-specific hybrids. Significant intra-specific variation in the pathogen was found for both infection success on a range of host genotypes (virulence) and components of spore production per infected host (aggressiveness) (sensu Burdon 1987). Strains did not have overall higher virulence on conspecifics of their host of origin than on strains from the heterospecific host, but they did have a significantly (c. 3 times) higher spore production per infected male host. This finding suggests that host adaptation may have evolved with respect to aggressiveness rather than virulence. The higher aggressiveness of strains on conspecifics of their host of origin resulted both from higher spore production per infected flower (spores are produced in the anthers), and greater ability to stimulate flower production on infected hosts. The latter indicates the presence of adaptive intra-specific variation in the ability of host manipulation. As transmission of the fungus is mediated by insects that are both pollinators of the host and vectors of the disease, we also assessed the effect of strains on host floral traits. Infection resulted in a reduction of inflorescence height, flower size, and nectar production per flower. Strains did not differ in their effect on nectar production, but infection with strains from S. alba resulted in a stronger reduction of inflorescence height and petal size on both host species. Vectors may therefore in principle discriminate among hosts infected by different strains and affect their efficiency of transmission. Contrary to assumptions of recent hypotheses about the role of host hybrids in the evolution of parasites, hybrids were not generally more susceptible than parental hosts. It is therefore unlikely that the rate of evolution of the pathogen on the parental species is slowed down by selection for specialization on the hybrids.",Host manipulation; Host specialization; Plant-pathogen interactions; Silene; Ustilago violacea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029766894

In vitro germination indicated no differences between vigor of large and small grains, but extraction and sieving reduced germinability. F1 seed from two of the crosses with size- selected pollen varied in weight according to pollen grain size, but in subsequent generations, the effect disappeared. Both size categories of selected pollen resulted in F2 progeny with reduced numbers of seeds per pod as compared to controls, suggesting that the size selection process may have resulted in indirect selection for traits reducing seed set.

To test these hypotheses, we examined how population size, local abundance of Salix caprea, and tree cover were related to pollen removal and fruit production in 16 populations of the deceptive, early-flowering and bumblebee- pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa in northern Sweden in 3 consecutive years. To determine whether fruit production was limited by pollinator visitation, supplemental hand-pollinations were performed in three populations in 3 years. Finally, to examine whether increased fruit production was associated with a reduction in future flower production, vegetative growth or survival, supplemental hand-pollination was repeated for 5 years in one population. The levels of pollen export, pollen deposition, and fruit set of C. bulbosa varied considerably among years and among populations. The proportion of plants exporting pollen was negatively related to population size, and positively related to density of S. caprea and to tree cover in 1 of the 3 years. In the other 2 years, no significant relationship was detected between proportion of plants exporting pollen and the latter three variables. In no year was there a significant relationship between fruit set and population size, density of S. caprea and tree cover. There was substantial among-year variation in the extent to which fruit production was limited by insufficient pollen deposition and in the amount of weather-induced damage to flowers and developing fruits. Fruit set was consistently higher in hand-pollinated than in open-pollinated plants, but this difference was statistically significant in only one of 3 years. Supplemental hand-pollination in 5 consecutive years increased cumulative fruit production 1.8 times, but did not affect flower production, plant size, or survival. Tree cover was negatively correlated with the incidence of frost damage in 1 year. The results indicate that life- time seed production may be pollen limited in C. bulbosa, and that variation in population size and local abundance of the early flowering, nectar- producing S. caprea can only partly explain the extensive variation in pollinator visitation among populations of this species.",Fruit set; Pollen removal; Pollination by deceit; Pollinator limitation; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029838956

Several notable ultrastructural appear in the nucellus, integument, chalaza, and bract lamina during pollination-drop secretion. The abaxial surface of the lamina is covered by a membrane that may contribute to the wettable nature of the surface.",ovulate cone; pollination drop; Sequoiadendron; Taxodiaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661052

I also used flight-cage experiments to compare pollen-transfer abilities of euglossine bees and heliconiid butterflies. Euglossine bees visited more frequently, visited earlier in the day, and visited a higher proportion of plants in the population than did other taxa. In flight cage experiments, bees and butterflies transferred similar amounts of pollen overall, but bees transferred significantly more inter-morph (compatible) pollen. For each component measured, euglossine bees appeared to be the most effective pollinators.",Distyly; Euglossine bee; Heliconiid butterfly; Pollinator effectiveness; Psychotria,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029849090

Inbreeding depression at several life-cycle stages was estimated by comparing the performance of crossed and selfed progeny from field-pollinated plants. Seed set was greater and seed abortion was less after crossing than after selfing. Seed weights did not differ. In the glasshouse, crossed progeny outperformed selfed progeny for seed germination, speed of germination, seedling dry weight, relative growth rate and survival. Cumulative inbreeding depression, estimated from seed set, seed germination, seedling dry weight and survival, was 0.69 ± 0.03, and was significantly greater than 0.50, the threshold level of inbreeding depression below which selfing should evolve. The availability of avian pollinators was assessed for 3 yr in five different populations. Low numbers of birds were observed on transects (peak flowering in January, 0.6 2.3: end of lowering in March, 0.3 1.0), and a low percentage of flowers were visited by birds (January, 21%; March, 1%). Nectarivorous birds were not important pollinators. Despite variation in abundance of and visitation by birds, natural seed set was similar within and among years (48.9 58.5%), and seed set of plants from which birds were excluded did not differ from control plants (both about 53%). Selection for reproductive assurance due to the paucity of avian pollinators would have favoured self-fertility in B. grandiflora, despite high inbreeding depression.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030304348

Here we evaluate how pollinator movement among plants, apparent pollen carryover, ovule number, resource limitation of seed set, and pollen output affect variation in contribution of individual pollinator species to seed set in Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae), a species visited by a broad spectrum of visitors, including beeflies, bees, and a moth species. A previous study demonstrated differences among visitor species in their single-visit pollination efficacy but did not evaluate how differences in visitation patterns and pollen carryover affect pollinator efficacy. Incorporation of differential visitation patterns and pollen carryover effects - commonly cited as potentially important in evaluating pollinator guilds - had minor effects (0-0.6% change) on the estimates of relative contribution based on visit frequency and single-visit efficacy alone. Beeflies visited significantly more flowers per inflorescence than the bees and the moth. Seed set remained virtually constant during the first three visited flowers for beeflies and larger bees, indicating that apparent pollen carryover did not reduce per-visit efficacy of these taxa. In contrast, Greya moth visits showed a decrease in seed set by 55.4% and the smaller bees by 45.4% from first to second flower. The larger carryover effects in smaller bees and Greya were diminished in importance by their small overall contribution to seed set. Three variable plant traits may affect seed set: ovule number, resource limitation on seed maturation, and pollen output. Ovule number per flower declined strongly with later position within inflorescences. Numbers were much higher in first-year greenhouse-grown plants than in field populations, and differences increased during 3 years of study. Mean pollen count by position varied 7-fold among flowers; it paralleled ovule number variation, resulting in a relatively stable pollen:ovule ratio. Resource limitation of seed set increased strongly with later flowering, with seed set in hand-pollinated flowers ranging from 66% in early flowers to 0% in the last two flowers of all plants. Variation in ovule number and resource limitation of seed maturation jointly had a strong effect on the number of seeds per flower. Visitation to early flowers had the potential to cause more seed set than visitation to later flowers. Overall, the most important sources of variation to seed production contribution were differences among pollinators in abundance and absolute efficacy (ovules fertilized on a single visit) and potentially differential phenology among visitor species. These effects are likely to vary among populations and years.",Ovule allocation; Pollen carryover; Pollen output; Pollinator efficacy; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029827489

An experimental comparison is difficult and time consuming, but a theoretical comparison may provide some guidelines. This study was conducted to compare theoretically the efficiency of different recurrent selection methods of improving the line value of a population, in this case, of self-pollinated crops. We considered five methods that are well adapted to breeding autogamous species: single-doubled-haploid descent selection with a 4-yr (SDH1) or 5-yr cycle (SDH2); selection on S1 family (S1); selection on S2 bulk (S2B) and on S2 family (S2F); and two other methods-selection on half-sib progeny (HSP) and on full-sib family (FSF)- used for the improvement of per se or combining ability values. Analytical expressions for the corresponding expected genetic advances (par growing season) were derived and compared according to the values of the narrow sense heritability and the variance components in an inbred system. SDH1 always appeared as the most efficient method. SDH2 and S2F were the next best methods for realistic values of parameters. S1 efficiency was restricted to very high heritabilities and additive variances. Gain due to higher gene fixation in the S2 families balanced the short cycle of S1. As the proportion of non- additive and environmental effects increased, SDH2 became more efficient than S2F, and S2F more efficient than S1. S2B was always the least efficient except when the possibility to reduce the between-plot environmental variance through a larger plot size was taken into account. In that case, S2B could be more efficient than S2F for medium to low heritabilities. HSP and FSF appeared only marginally as the second or third most efficient methods. SDH is the best method to improve autogamous crops even though cycle length is 5 yr; however, if haplo-diploidization technologies are not available or are too expensive, a selection scheme based on S2 family may be the most economical method.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030450268

Inflorescences were collected weekly during the flowering season, and the proportion of foreign pollen/stigma was recorded. Flowering phenologies of sympatric species and ovule and seed counts of study species were also recorded. Heterospecific pollen was detected on some stigmas of each species. Medicago sativa (Fabaceae) received the most foreign pollen; in some cases, all of the grains on a stigma were heterospecific. Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) received the least amount of foreign pollen; the incidence of heterospecific pollen was near zero in most cases. The mean and range of foreign pollen received varied by as much as an order of magnitude between species. The six species with zygomorphic flowers, all Fabaceae, received more heterospecific pollen that the three species with actinomorphic flowers. Potentilla recta and P. simplex (Rosaceae) and Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae). This probably reflects a bias because our data were analyzed on a cumulative basis and the Fabaceae had longer flowering phenologies. HPT was not correlated with the species' relative abundance within the community. Proportion of foreign pollen received varied temporally within species, and this variation generally was not related to phenology of any sympatric taxa of the species' own phenology. Pollen grain diameter was positively related to levels of foreign pollen received by species. This might be caused by poor adhesion of large pollen grains to small stigmatic papilae or if generalist pollinators carrying large amounts of heterospecific pollen visit the large- grained species and specialists with little foreign pollen visit the small- grained species. The large proportions of heterospecific pollen on stigmas of many species indicate that HPT occurs frequently in the community we studied and the implications may include reduced seed set because of occlusion by foreign grains. As yet, however, it is unclear how important a factor HPT is in mediating pollen limitation of reproductive success.",heterospecific pollen transfer; midsuccessional old- fields; pollination; stigmas,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661051

Comparison of the silencing of chilinasa and ?-1,3-glucanase transgenes with the same expression signals and breeding experiments with transgenes inserted in different chromosomes showed that chitinase-gene silencing depends on transcribed sequence homology and transgene dose. The CHN48 transgene silenced host class I but not class II chitinases suggesting that greater than about 60% identity of sequences encoding the catalytic domain is required for silencing. Although steady-state mRNA contents were greatly reduced in silent plants, the levels of nascent chitinase transcripts detected in nuclear run-on experiments were the same in nuclei from high-expressing and silent plants. This strongly suggests that chitinase-gene silencing is a post-transcriptional phenomenon. Silencing and resetting to high-level expression of chitinase genes is developmentally regulated. Silencing occurs stochastically in 25-100% of seedlings at the 6-10 leaf stage of development and is preceded by a marked, transient increase in transgene-encoded chitinase. Resetting of silent genes to the high-expressing state is a non-stochastic event that occurs in developing seeds 811 days after pollination. Experiments with lateral buds and plants regenerated from cultured leaf disks show that once established, competence for silencing can persist in dormant, actively growing, and de novo established shoot meristems. Some plants show a variegated pattern of silencing. Analyses of these patterns indicate that chitinase-gene silencing is not a clonal event. Thus, it is likely that communication between cells rather than the lineage of the cells is important in stabilizing the silent state. Possible mechanisms for developmentally regulated post-transcriptional silencing are discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030470302

A PCR product in the expected size range was amplified from all species and interspecific polymorphism was detected at all five loci. Intraspecific polymorphism was detected in P.radaita with four of then five primer pairs. One of these polymorphic chloroplast SSR (cpSSR) was then used to determine the inheritance of chloroplasts in 206 progeny from four control-pollinated, full-sibling P. radiata families. Approximately 99% of the progeny had the cpSSR variant of the pollen parent indicating that in Pinus radiata, like other conifers, chloroplasts are typically inherited from the paternal parent. These results suggest that polymorphic chloroplast SSRs will be a valuable tool for studying chloroplast diversity, cyto-nuclear disequilibrium, and plastid inheritance in a range of species, and for the analysis of gene flow via pollen and paternity in species with paternal transmission of chloroplasts.",Chloroplast DNA; Pinus radiata; Plastid inheritance; SSRs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029828021

Large differences in yields were recorded among clones, ranging from 1.9 to 14.7 t·ha-1 in 1994 and 8.4 to 28.3 t·ha-1 in 1995. Clones with severe symptoms produced smaller fruit than clones with slight symptoms in 1994 but not in 1995. Small differences existed for the titratable acidity of the fruit but not for soluble solids concentration. The frequency of normal green seedlings among selfed progeny ranged from 48% to 98% and was negatively correlated with symptom severity ratings of the parent clones.

Gene Ac73 is present in a heterozygous condition. Homozygous resistant BC1F3 lines carrying Ac71 or Ac72 were developed from a BC1F1 family in which segregation for white rust resistance fitted a 3 resistant (R):1 susceptible (S) ratio. To isolate the resistance genes, one BC1F3 line was assumed to have genotype Ac71Ac71ac72ac72 and was used as a tester to cross with other selected BC1F3 lines. Progenies from test crosses were self-pollinated and backcrossed to susceptible line 2282-9. Thus, two monogenic lines possessing Ac71 or Ac72 were developed as F2 and backcross populations produced from four test crosses segregated to fit 15 R:1 S and 3 R:1 S ratios, respectively, whereas the other four lines were homozygous resistant. The two single-gene lines were used as testers to develop a monogenic line with Ac73 from a BC1F1 family that segregated in a 7 R:1 S ratio. These single genes are being incorporated into rapid-cycling B. napus lines susceptible to several pathotypes of A. candida to develop isogenic differential lines. The monogenic lines will be used to study the mechanism(s) of resistance response conditioned by the individual genes.

Just as the loss of a single thread in a web can weaken the whole structure, the loss of an individual species can disrupt an entire ecosystem. Electric utilities are becoming increasingly aware of the value of diverse ecosystems, and a number of power companies have initiated programs designed specifically to preserve and enhance biodiversity. Such programs go beyond traditional environmental efforts: they account for the well-being of entire habitats rather than focusing strictly on individual species. As representatives at EPRI's recent biodiversity conference stressed, this broader mission calls for a range of expertise that can only be acquired through partnership. Indeed, a variety of stakeholders-including industry, conservation groups, government agencies, and community members -are teaming up on the biodiversity issue.

Two maize synthetics, EZS1, a mixture of Spanish open-pollinated flint varieties, and EZS2, crosses among North American dent-improved populations, were produced in Zaragoza, Spain. The synthetics showed heterotic behavior and were subjected to two cycles of S1- progeny intrapopulation selection for grain yield and lodging resistance before starting reciprocal recurrent selection. Our objectives were to partition the response to selection into additive and dominance effects after two cycles of intrapopulation selection, with generation mean analysis and diversity analysis. The entries resulting from a diallel mating design, without reciprocals, among the original and first two cycles for each population, were tested in five environments. The results showed that both populations were responsive to selection for improved grain yield, but only EZS2 was improved by selection against lodging. Diversity analysis was less conservative than the generation means model in detecting significant genetic effects. Genetic effects associated with selection for grain yield and lodging were mostly additive, but a significant dominance effect was detected in EZS2 for lodging. The improvement of the population cross did not match that of the populations per se, especially for EZS2. A loss of heterosis for the cross was detected, which might become unrecoverable if S1 selection is continued. It was concluded that S1 selection should be discontinued and that reciprocal recurrent selection should be initiated.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030466719

At a developmental level, the ovary weights of three non-parthenocarpic lines and three near-isogenic parthenocarpic (pat-2) lines were compared. Four developmental stages were considered: flower bud, preanthesis, anthesis and 4 days after anthesis. The parthenocarpic lines displayed ovary weights higher than their respective non-parthenocarpic lines from preanthesis to 4 days after anthesis. A molecular approach involved comparison of in vitro translation products from flower RNAs taken from the same developmental stages of non-parthenocarpic and near-isogenic parthenocarpic (pat-2 and pat-3/pat-4) lines. Analysis by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the differential expression of a 30-kDa product in parthenocarpic materials from preanthesis to anthesis. These results suggest that the physiological and molecular events responsible for parthenocarpy begin at the preanthesis stage, before the flower is completely mature and receptive to pollination. The differential expression of this in vitro translation product in pat-2 and pat-3/pat-4 genotypes also suggests a common or confluent molecular basis in genetically controlled parthenocarpy.",Genetic parthenocarpy; Lycopersicon esculentum; ovary development; pat-2 and pat-3/pat-4 genes; tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030513287

This occurs in seeds removed from the fruit prior to completion of development at 45 d after pollination and placed directly on water, or following drying. Hence desiccation is not required to induce either germination- or post-germination-related mannanase activity. Incubating seeds in abscisic acid or osmoticum results in a reduction of both germination and total mannanase activity, but the isoforms that are produced in the embryo and micropylar region of the endosperm are identical to those produced in water-imbibed seeds prior to germination. Incubation of seeds in a high concentration of abscisic acid prevents all enzyme production. Only after the completion of germination does mannanase increase in the lateral regions of the endosperm. In contrast, mannanase is produced in the micropylar region regardless of whether the seed germinates or not. The isoforms produced in the two regions of the endosperm are different, those in the lateral endosperm being more similar to those produced in the cotyledons and axes of the embryo.

To determine whether pollen might serve as a food source for tadpoles, pine and oak pollen, algae, and a control (a 3:1 mixture of ground rabbit chow pellets and flaked fish food) were fed ad libitum to tadpoles to determine the effects of a single food type and sequential presentation of different foods on growth and development. Using a repeated measures design, tadpole body length, mass, and developmental stage were measured at the start of the experiment and every nine days thereafter. The experimental results showed that tadpoles fed pine pollen at any point in the experiment were significantly smaller than tadpoles receiving other foods.

A single hawk moth visit to a flower could be sufficient for successful fertilization. Additional visits up to five increased percentage fruit set, but flowers that received six or more visits had lower fruit and seed set.

K7L 3N6, Canada","The evolution of distyly from tristyly has occurred repeatedly, especially in the Lythraceac. However, the evolutionary forces involved remain unclear since species exhibiting transitional stages between tristyly and distyly have rarely been studied. The self-compatible, wetland perennial Decodon venticillatus (Lythraceae) may provide this transitional variation since populations commonly lack style morphs, particularly the mid-styled (M) morph. In dimorphic populations lacking the M morph, anthers positioned at the mid level in both the long- (L) and short-styled (S) morphs have lost their target stigma, setting the stage for eithr evolutionary repositioning of mid-level anthers to increase pollen export to L and S stigmas, or increased variability in mid-level anther position resulting from relaxed selcetion. We examined these two hypothesis by comparing floral morphology in eight dimorphic and ten trimorphic populations from throughout the species' range. We found no evidence that loss of the M morph has led to evolutionary modification of mid-level stamens. While mid-level stamens of the S morph were 11.0 ± 4.0% (mean ± 1 SE) longer than those of the L morph in dimoprhic populations, divergence in stamen length between morphs occurred to the same extent (10.4 ± 2.0%) in trimorphic populations and cannot be attributed to the absence of the M morph. Analyses of variability usding median tests revealed no difference in the variability of mid-level stamen length between dimorphic and trimorphic populations. Mid-level stamens were not variable than long- and short-level stamens within dimorphic populations. The consistent divergence in mid-level stamens between the L and S morphs may reflect morph-specific differences in the optimal position of mid-level anthers for maximizing cross-pollination and avoiding self-fertilization.",Decodon verticillatus; floral evolution; floral morphology; heterostyly; Lythraceae; natural selection; pollination biology; sexual systems; swamp loosestrife; tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661059

However, without a dispensing mechanism to limit the pollen extraction a single forager might be able to glean all of the pollen from a flower in a single visit. 2. The vibratory release mechanism of a buzz-pollinated flower species, Solanum laciniatum, and its relationship with time was investigated. 3. The sonication vibration magnitude required to eject pollen from the anthers increased with frequency; vibrations at frequencies below 180Hz were particularly effective owing to the low (124Hz) natural frequency of the stamens and the good transmission of low-frequency vibration by the anthers. The natural frequency of stamens was low compared with the sonication frequencies of bumble-bees and did not change significantly when sonicated. 4. Large amounts of pollen (72000 grains) were released in initial sonications, but this was a small percentage (18%) of the total available pollen; pollen release continued in metered quantities over time. 5. The stamen vibration mode created centrifugal forces, which forced pollen out of the apical pores, and the gradual dehydration of the tapetal fluid remaining in lower regions of dehiscent poricidal anthers produced a timed release mechanism. 6. The frequency increase from the flight wing-beat frequency to the sonication buzz enables bumble-bees to generate high accelerations, which are able to release pollen from the anthers, using thoracic vibrations, which are limited by the maximum possible displacement of the indirect flight muscles.",Bumble-bees; buzz pollination; pollen release; pollination; vibration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030304883

Narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.2-0.8 were detected for the morphometric traits of corolla length, corolla width, stigma position, and anther position. The proportion of time spent by the protandrous flowers in the pistillate phase ('proportion pistillate') also exhibited detectable heritability of near 0.3. In contrast, heritability estimates for nectar reward traits were low and not significantly different from zero, due to high environmental variance between and within flowering years. The estimates of genetic parameters were combined with phenotypic selection gradients to predict evolutionary responses to selection mediated by the hummingbird pollinators. One trait, corolla width, showed the potential for a rapid response to ongoing selection through male function, as it experienced both direct selection, by influencing pollen export, and relatively high heritability. Predicted responses were lower for proportion pistillate and corolla length, even though these traits also experienced direct selection. Stigma position was expected to respond positively to indirect selection of proportion pistillate but negatively to selection of corolla length, with the net effect sensitive to variation in the selection estimates.

In addition to gender-specific cone morphologies, males and females differed in secondary sex characters such as age at first production, frequency of cone production, mean cone numbers in second and later coning episodes, and, in order plants, mean leaf and branch numbers. Gender differences expressed themselves at different stages in the life history: their nature and extent varied during the years follwing sexual maturation. By 1995, 46% of the plants in the progeny died, most of them before producing cones. Prior to 1988 the mean number of plants that died did not differe from that of survivors, but the mean leaf number of plants of dying between 1988 and 1989 was 0.4 times that of the survivors during that period, suggesting reduced vigor prior to death. Mean age at first cone production was 5.8 yr for males and 6.6 yr for females. Mean dry masses of individual male cones increased between the first and second coning episodes, but not between the second and third coning episodes. Mean dry masses of the entire cone crop of individual males increased through the third coning episode due to an increase in mean number per episode, but mean cone number was unchanged between the third and fourth coning episodes. Mean dry masse of unpollinated female cones did not change between the first and second coning episodes; mean cone numbers did not change between the first and third coning episodes. After the first coning episode, males produced higher mean cone numbers than females. By 1995, the mean dry mass of an individual male's cone crop was greater than that of a female. Coning frequency of males was 1.7 times greater than that of unpollinated females, suggesting a gender difference inthe genetic control of coning frequency. Coning frequency of females pollinated 1 or 2 yr previously was reduced compared with that of unpollinated females. Cone production did not affect subsequent leaf production by either gender. Mean leaf numbers increased in some year and not in other. Mean leaf numbers of males and females did not differ prior to cone production. After cone production mean leaf number of males were greater than that of females. Mean age of males producing first branches was 6.3 yr. with a mean of 2.5 first branches per plant. Mean age of females producing first brnaches was 7.7 yr. with a mean of 2.5 first branches per plant. By 1995 the mean branch number of males was 5.7 per plant and of females was 2.7 per plant. Between 1993 and 1995 the mean brnach number of males and females increased incrementally, but mean leaf numbers did not change. In early years of branching, leaf number increased with branch number, high mean leaf numbers of males of an age class thus reflected their ealier branching. Males produced first cones earlier than females. Since branch production was associated with cone production, higher branch numbers of males in an age class reflected their earlier first cone production.

The study included two clades (phylogenetic lineages) in which small-flowered, homostylous populations or species are believed to have evolved from large flowered, heterostylous, self-compatible ones. In one lineage the small-flowered species is tetraploid with disomic inheritance. Rates of self-fertilization were 25% to 55% in the four large-flowered, heterostylous populations; 72% in a large flowered but homostylous population; and greater than 99.5% in the four small-flowered, homostylous populations, which produce seed autonomously. When present, inbreeding depression occurred in the fertility but not the survival components of fitness. Using a cumulative fitness measure incorporating both survival and fertility (flower number), we found inbreeding depression to be lower in the four very highly self-fertilizing populations than in the five intermediate ones. The Spearman rank correlation between inbreeding depression and selling rate for the nine populations was -0.50, but was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Inbreeding depression was greater in the two tetraploid populations than in the very highly self-fertilizing, diploid ones. Phenotypic stability of progeny from self-fertilization tended to be higher in populations with lower inbreeding depression. We conclude that levels of self-fertilization and inbreeding depression in Amsinckia are determined more by other factors than by each other. Estimates of mutation rates and dominance coefficients of deleterious alleles, obtained from a companion study of the four highly self-fertilizing populations, suggest that a strong relationship may not be expected. We discuss the relationship of the present results to current theory of the coevolution of self-fertilization and inbreeding depression.",Autogamy; dominance; flower size; heterosis; heterostyly; homeostasis; mating system; mutation rate; mutation-selection balance; overdominance; pollination; polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660865

In a total of 200 inflorescences in two natural populations of Iris versicolor, flowers were observed and classified daily on the basis of anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity. Analysis of the flowering phenology demonstrated that (1) protandry limits opportunities for autogamy, (2) flowers mature sequentially within a floral unit (defined as a cluster of flowers borne on a single branch within an inflorescence), preventing the opportunity for geflonogamous fertilization between flowers of the same floral unit, and (3) 77% of all flowers had no opportunity to be pollinated by another flower within the same inflorescence. Both the number and the proportion of flowers with opportunities for geitonogamy increased with the number of flowers open in each population, and opportunities for geitonogamy also increased with the number of floral units within inflorescences. These morphological and phenological controls suggest that when selfing occurs in this species, it is most likely to occur between flowers on different inflorescences within the same clone.

Since cereals have a large persisting endosperm, it is expected that embryo size is affected by endosperm development. Nine single recessive mutations, four reduced embryo mutations representing three loci, REDUCED EMBRYO1, REDUCED EMBRYO2 and REDUCED EMBRYO3, four giant embryo mutations derived from a single locus GIANT EMBRYO, and one endospermless mutation endospermless1-2 were analyzed. Every reduced embryo mutation caused reduction of all the embryonic organs including apical meristems and the enlargement of the endosperm. The giant embryo mutants have a reduced endosperm and an enlarged scutellum. However, shoot and radicle sizes were not affected. All the reduced embryo and giant embryo mutations did not largely affect postembryonic development. Accordingly, the expression of genes analyzed are seed-specific. In reduced embryo and giant embryo mutations, abnormalities were detected in both embryo and endosperm as early as 2 days after pollination, endospermless1-1 resulted in an early loss of endosperm, yielding a giant embryo, suggesting that embryo growth was physically limited by the endosperm. A double mutant between giant embryo-2 and club-shaped embryo1-1, which has a normal endosperm and a minute undifferentiated embryo, resulted in a club-shaped embryo1-1 embryo and a reduced endosperm of giant embryo-2, indicating that GIANT EMBRYO regulates the endosperm development. Double mutants between giant embryo-2 and three reduced embryo mutants exhibited the reduced embryo phenotype in both embryo and endosperm, suggesting that reduced embryo mutations cause the enlarged endosperm. Further, a double mutant of reduced embryo3 and endospermless1-1 showed the enlarged embryo in endospermless seed, This confirms that reduced embryo3 does not regulate embryo size but enlarges endosperm size. Together with the results of the other double mutant analysis, REDUCED EMBRYO1, REDUCED EMBRYO2, REDUCED EMBRYO3 and GIANT EMBRYO are concluded to regulate endosperm development.",Embryo size; Endosperm; giant embryo; reduced embryo; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030018198

Viable zygotes were excised from embryo sacs by minimal enzymatic digestion and microdissection. Viable zygotes transferred to coculture with androgenic microspores from barley developed into embryo-like structures in 61% of the cases. No development was observed when zygotes were cultured in the presence of maize anthers undergoing androgenetic embryogenesis. Zygote-derived embryo-like structures regenerated into fertile plants through secondary embryogenesis when transferred to solid medium. The first zygotic division was asymmetrical and bipolar structures similar to pretransitional embryos observed in planta were later produced as observed using light and electron microscopy. Conditions for efficient microinjection of DNA into zygotes were established. Calcofluor and PATAG staining of zygotes showed that cell wall regeneration occurred as early as 20 min after enzymatic isolation and that after 2 hr, each zygote was bordered with cell wall material. Through quantitative microphotometry, DNA synthesis during the first cell cycle of the zygote was shown to occur between isolation and 12 hr of culture. Microinjection of two types of reporter genes (GUS gene and anthocyanin regulatory genes) demonstrates transient expression in plant zygotes. On average, 3.5% of microinjected zygotes showed transgenic expression. Reporter gene expression was observed in zygotes at different time points of their first cell cycle.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030578461

The first observed event after pollination is an increase in the flower's sensitivity to ethylene, followed by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis. Our objectives were to study the mode of action of the increase in ethylene sensitivity and the possible involvement of short-chain saturated fatty acids (SCSFAs) in this process. Application of SCSFAs, ranging in chain length from 7 to 10 carbons onto stigmas of Phalaenopsis (Phalaenopsis hybrid, cv. Herbert Hager) flowers increased their sensitivity to ethylene in the same way as pollination. Following pollination, there was a significant increase in the endogenous content of these fatty acids in the flower's column and perianth, with octanoic acid (C8) being the main SCSFA observed. The increase in SCSFA content was observed as early as 6 h after pollination and began to decline 6 h later. Incorporation of octanoic acid into liposomes or microsomal membranes isolated from Phalaenopsis petals resulted in a decrease in lipid order that was detected by fluorescence polarization of dansyl pyrrolidine (DNSP) but not of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). At peak ethylene sensitivity, 10 h after pollination, there was a significant decrease in the lipid order of microsomal membranes isolated from Phalaenopsis columns and perianths, again as detected by DNSP but not by DPH. Stigmatic application of octanoic acid mimicked the effect of pollination on membrane lipid order. We suggest that SCSFAs may be the ethylene 'sensitivity factors' produced following pollination, and that their mode of action involves a decrease in the order of specific regions in the membrane lipid bilayer, consequently altering ethylene action.",Ethylene; Fatty acids; Fluorescence polarization; Lipid order; Membranes; Phalaenopsis hybrid; Pollination; Senescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030512490

Until recently, it was assumed that there was a short window of time during which a fig crop could be pollinated. Hence, pollination of figs was thought to depend on extreme efficiency of the wasps in locating receptive trees. In that context, extensive data on the Costa Rican fig tree Ficus pertusa L. have been very difficult to understand. In F. pertusa, figs of different crops attract wasps at different stages of their development. The crops that attract wasps the earliest in their development are the most heavily visited ones, but mature the fewest pollinator offspring and seeds on a per-fig basis. Using simulation models of pollinator population dynamics and field data, we show that (i) attractiveness of a crop is prolonged, (ii) wasps prefer large figs when given a choice, and (iii) the observed pattern of preferential early visitation of crops can be explained by temporal variations in pollinator abundance. This emphasizes the importance of population-level mechanisms to explain the fig/fig wasp mutualism.",Fig; Mutualism; Pollination; Population dynamics; Receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302883

We identified a hypervariable marker based on oliog-(GATA)4-hybridization of DpnII-cut genomic DNA from Sea Lavender (Limonium carolinianum). Banding patterns were somatically stable and highly variable among unrelated individuals. Band molecular-weight sizing errors (as a percent of band molecular weight) were estimated at 0.44%±0.003 within gels and 0.76%±0.964 between gels. Band sizing errors defined a 99% confidence bin of ±0.95% (1.90% total) of molecular weight. Band-sharing estimates were based on this bin size and on variance estimates that compensate for non-independent comparisons. Band-sharing among nine unrelated individuals (??) was 0.198±0.011. Experimental pollinations designed to produce selfed, full- and half-sib progeny groups led to five selfed progeny groups and no outcrossed progeny (mean band-sharing, S=0.468±0.074). A linear regression between band-sharing (S) and relatedness (r) assuming 17% inbreeding was r=0.006±0.914*S (R2=0.973) and established the maximum amount of inbreeding. S?(0.392±0.022) estimated from wild pollinated seeds from four maternal families was intermediate to unrelated individuals and experimental selfed progeny, giving evidence for mixed mating in wild plants. More extensive plant pedigrees with known levels of inbreeding will be needed to measure variation in the relationship between S and r among populations and families.",Limonium carolinianum; Mating system; Multilocus fingerprint; Plumbaginaceae; Relatedness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029854256

We used scanning electronic microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and blue light microscopy. The stigmas remain fresh throughout male anthesis, and may also last after its end, depending on ambient temperatures. The presence of germinated pollen does not induce stigmatic necrotization, and grains may arrive at different times. The pollen tube tips remain within the stigma base until the end of female anthesis. The ovules will not develop until after necrotization of the stigmas. The pollen tubes thus have a fair start to the ovules, regardless of their different arrival times and of the original positions of the pollen grains at the stigma surface. Therefore, competition among different microgametophytes is possible, in spite of low pollination intensity. Our results indicate that when the first pollen tube penetrates an ovule, this ovule starts to outgrow the other one, and even if the other is also penetrated, its vascular support soon atrophies and the megagametophyte will shrivel.

We explore how a self-compatible disturbance species. Nicotiana attenuata, copes with this potential dilemma by examining the changes in emission of chemicals from flowers in response to pollination and herbivory. We propose that chemical changes induced by herbivory and pollination reflect the function of the chemicals in the plant. The emission of a single compound, benzyl acetone (BA, 4-phenyl-2-butanone), by flowers increases dramatically (50x) in the evening, peaking just after dark a pattern of emission characteristic of moth-pollinated flowers. Pools of BA were found only in the outer lip of the corolla where pollinators come in contact with the flower, and diurnal changes in the size of the corolla pool closely paralleled the amount emitted by intact flowers throughout the day, as determined by headspace sampling. Pollination dramatically decreases both the pools of BA in the corolla and its emission from flowers. Similarly, nicotine, a broadly biocidal defense metabolite and an induced defense in vegetative and reproductive tissues, is also found in the headspace of flowers and is principally localized in the basal parts of the corolla below the attachment of the filaments trod the nectar reward. Moreover, the dynamics of the corolla pools of BA and nicotine throughout the day are consistent with their roles in advertisement and defense, respectively. The corolla pools of nicotine are stable throughout the day except during the period of peak BA production and emission when nicotine pools decrease significantly. The coordinated increase in BA emission and decline in nicotine pools are not inexorably linked, because herbivory or mechanical damage to corolla tissue rapidly increases corolla nicotine pools without affecting the increase in BA pools. Similarly, leaf damage results in a slower, systemic increase in corolla nicotine pools during reproductive growth but again does not affect BA pools. Excised flowers emitted BA in a manner similar to that of intact flowers, and excision of a majority of flowers from a plant did not alter the BA emission patterns of the remaining flowers. We conclude that although N. attenuata's defensive and advertisement chemistries respond synchronously to some environmental stimuli, the flowers' chemical responses to pollinators and herbivores are distinct and the differences reflect their ecological roles. We propose that the cost benefit framework of the optimal defense and apparency theories can be fruitfully applied to the allocation of defense metabolites and floral volatiles that function in pollinator attraction, and that this framework can be readily tested by manipulating the patterns of the emissions of plants in the field.",Apparency; Benzyl acetone; Floral volatiles; Nicotine; Plant defense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661208

Owing to the positioning of the two tissues deeply within the ovary, neither cell types have been easily accessible for molecular studies. In this paper we report for the first time the cloning of molecular markers for the barley endosperm coenocyte and the nucellus. The novel ENDI and NUCI cDNAs were isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library from 5 DAP (days after pollination) ovaries using a positive probe from hand dissected embryo sacs with adhering nucellus and testa cell layers, and a negative probe from pericarp. In situ and northern blot hybridization data show that ENDI transcripts are asymmetrically distributed in the endosperm coenocyte limited to an area over the nucellar projection. In the cellular endosperm, END 1 transcripts are present in modified aleurone cells and a few layers of ventral starchy endosperm cells. The second clone, NUC 1, hybridizes to transcripts in the nucellus before fertilization and in autolyzing nucellus cells after fertilization. At later stages, after the disappearance of nucellus, NUC 1 transcripts are present in the nucellar epidermis and in the lateral cells of the nucellar projection.

Raj and Kendrick (syn: Thielaviopsis basicola [Berk. and Broome] Ferr.), is a common soil-borne fungal disease in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., 2n=SSTT=48). Only polygenic partial resistance to this disease is available in the original tobacco genomes; however, Nicotiana debneyi Domin, a tetraploid relative of tobacco (2n = XXYY = 48) has complete resistance to a wide spectrum of black root rot biotypes. A fertile somatic hybrid between N. tabacum 'Delgold' and N. debneyi was previously produced and was used to transfer the N. debneyi black root rot resistance into tobacco. Tobacco addition lines carrying the N. debneyi chromosomes with the gene for black root rot resistance were produced after two generations of backcrossing to the recurrent tobacco parent followed by two generations of selfing. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses of the disomic (2n = 50) addition lines and 14 monosomic (2n = 49) addition lines derived there from provided strong evidence that the two N. debneyi chromosomes in the 2n = 50 addition lines were identical. However, the tobacco genetic background apparently prevented homologous pairing of these chromosomes or caused their desynapsis. Lagging chromosomes at anaphase I and micronuclei at telophase I were observed. Transmission rates of the N. debneyi chromosomes through the egg and pollen of the addition lines were 8.1 and 10.1%, respectively. The N. debneyi chromosomes in the addition lines occasionally paired with tobacco chromosomes, and therefore, translocation lines with black root rot resistance (2n = 24 II) may be obtained in the self-pollinated progeny by crossing-over. Seventeen RAPD markers were found to be associated with the N. debneyi chromosomes in the addition lines and these should be useful in monitoring further transfer of N. debneyi chromosome fragments into the tobacco genomes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029902904

Inflorescences are terminal and synchronously protandrous. We compared the effects of defoliation of the flowering shoot on flower size, nectar production, pollen removal and deposition, and pollen grain size. Treatments were designed to test for the effects of level and position of leaf removal. They were: (1) 100% defoliation; (2) all leaves from the upper half of the shoot removed (= 50% UH); (3) all leaves from the lower half removed (= 50% LH), and (4) control (i.e. no defoliation). Defoliation was performed in four flowering patches 4 - 7 d before anthesis. Flower size (estimated by inner tepal length) was slightly, but significantly reduced by the removal of the lower leaves (100% defoliation and 50% LH treatments). Sugar production/6 h tended to be higher in control shoots than in defoliated ones, but the response was heterogeneous among the four study flowering patches. Laboratory experiments suggest a great degree of automony of isolated flowers in terms of sugar nectar secretion, perhaps because of carbohydrates being stored in the nectaries prior to anthesis. No effect of defoliation was observed on the number of pollen grains removed from the anthers or deposited on the stigmas. Pollen grain size was significantly reduced by defoliation following the expected gradient 'Control > 50% LH > 50% UH > 100% defoliation'. To the extent that size reflects amount of reserves in pollen grains, defoliation might be affecting the post-pollination competitive ability of a donor plant.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030304335

The bees constituting the first two guilds were shadeloving, swiftly flying, long-tongued trapliners. Proboscis lengths of these pollinators correlated with flower depth of the host plant. Pollination systems in the forest understory were distinguished from that in the canopy by the prevalence of specific interactions, the number of traplining solitary bees, and lack of pollination systems by mass-recruiting eusocial bees, large Xylocopa bees, thrips, bats, and wind.

In this study, we examine the components of the extracellular matrices (ECMs) of the lily pollen tubes and TTEs that may be involved in this adhesion event. Several monoclonal antibodies to plant cell wall components such as esterified pectins, unesterified pectins, and arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) were used to localize these molecules in the lily pollen tube and style at both light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) levels. In addition. (?-D-Glc)3 Yariv reagent which binds to AGPs was used to detect AGPs in the pollen tube and style. At the LM level, unesterified pectins were localized to the entire wall in in- vivo- and in-vitro-grown pollen tubes as well as to the surface of the stylar TTEs. Esterified pectins occurred at the tube tip region (with some differences in extent in in-vivo versus in-vitro tubes) and were evenly distributed in the entire style. At the TEM level, esterified pectins were detected inside pollen tube cell vesicles and unesterified pectins were localized to the pollen tube wall. The in-vivo pollen tubes adhere to each other and can be separated by pectinase treatment. At the LM level, AGP localization occurred in the tube tip of both in-vivo- and in- vitro-grown pollen tubes and, in the case of one AGP probe, on the surface of the TTEs. Another AGP probe localized to every cell of the style except the surface of the TTE.

We hypothesize that the lower lips and trumpet-shaped orifices of many hummingbird flowers act as nectar guides to direct hummingbirds to the flowers' nectar and orient the birds for pollination. To test this hypothesis we conducted laboratory experiments using flowers of Monarda didyma (bec balm) and M. fistulosa (wild bergamot), which have orifice widths of about 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively, and latex flowers with orifice widths of 4 mm and 2 mm and three orifice shapes (trumpet, lipped, and lipless). Ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) made fewer errors during bill insertion and spent a smaller proportion of their feeding visit in error at M. didyma flowers than at M. fistulosa flowers, and at unaltered flowers of both species than at flowers with lower lips removed. Handling times were longer at both lipped and lipless flowers of M. didyma than at those of M. fistulosa, and at lipped than at lipless flowers of M. didyma. The average duration of contact between a hummingbird and a flower's anthers and stigma was longer at M. didyma than at M. fistulosa for both lipped and lipless flowers, and at lipped than at lipless M. didyma flowers. Hummingbirds missed the openings of latex flowers with their bills more frequently and spent a greater percentage of their total feeding visit in error at (i) 2-mm than at 4-mm flowers of all three shapes, (ii) lipless flowers than at trumpet or lipped flowers, and (iii) lipped flowers than at trumpet flowers of both widths. The duration of hummingbird/anther contact was longer at (i) 2-mm than at 4-mm flowers of all shapes, (ii) lipped than at trumpet flowers for both widths. No significant differences in handling times of hummingbirds were observed among any of the latex flower shapes or widths.

To investigate such costs, 27 half-sib families of Silene alba, collected from a single host population, were grown in experimental populations in the presence and absence of the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea, a host-sterilizing pathogen transmitted by insects that are both pollinators and vectors of the disease. Host families significantly in resistance to inoculation, indicating the presence of genetic variation for mechanisms that impede fungal growth once the disease is encountered ('biochemical' resistance) within the host population. In addition, host families differed significantly in onset of flowering and in flower production in the absence of the disease. Path analysis revealed that late onset of flowering in male host families made a direct contribution to high resistance (P < .0.1), probably due to a reduced rate of contact between hosts and vectors varying high spore loads (avoidance, or 'phenological' resistance). The contribution of low production to field resistance only approached significance (P<0.10). There was a significantly positive genetic association between biochemical and phenological resistance, suggesting that delayed flowering is either a pleiotropic effect of biochemical resistance, or that genes governing these traits are in linkage disequilibrium. Path analysis revealed that biochemical resistance and both a direct contribution to field resistance (P < 0.01) and a positive indirect contribution via its association with phenology and flower production (P < 0.05) in male hosts. Costs of resistance were sex specific. Male host families with high field resistance had significantly lower reproductive success in healthy populations, indicating a fitness cost of field resistance (P < 0.01), whereas no costs were detected for female hosts. Path analysis revealed that the biochemical component of field resistance made to direct contribution to the observed fitness cost in male hosts, whereas its indirect effect through phenology was only marginally significant (P < 0.10). This finding indicates fitness costs were mainly due to the phenological component of field resistance. Because the host population had no known history of disease, it is not clear whether the fitness costs are responsible for maintenance of the resistance polymorphism or whether the polymorphism is present for reasons unrelated to pathogens. Interactions between host families and pathogen strains with respect to inoculation success were not significant. Hence, there was no evidence for indirect costs of biochemical resistance, that is, reduced resistance to alternative strains.

The argE gene product of Escherichia coli, representing a N-acetyl-L-ornithine deacetylase was identified to remove the acetyl-group from N-ac-Pt giving the cytotoxic compound L-phosphinothricin (Pt, glufosinate). Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants constitutively expressing the argE gene were constructed. No effect of the bacterial N-acetyl-L-ornithine deacetylase on plant growth and reproduction could be traced. However, application of N-ac-Pt on leaves of the transgenic plants led to the formation of necrotic areas due to the release of Pt. Additionally, due to the uptake of the N-ac-Pt by roots, transgenic shoots grown on medium containing N-ac-Pt bleached within 6-7 days and finally died. Untransformed controls showed no reaction to high amounts of N-ac-Pt applied, either under sterile or under unsterile conditions. In order to construct inducible male-sterile plants, the argE coding region was fused to a DNA fragment carrying sequences homologous to the tobacco TA29 promoter, known to function exclusively in the tapetum. Owing to the tapetum-specific expression of the chimeric gene the application of N-ac-Pt led to empty anthers resulting in male-sterile plants. The sanity of the female reproductive part of the male-sterile flowers could be demonstrated by cross-pollination. Without N-ac-Pt treatment the plants turned out to be completely fertile making fertility restoration in the F1 generation superflous. The system presented is easy to handle and might be applicable to a wide range of crop plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030161125

Ovules of Gnetum gnemon were collected at various stages after hand pollination and processed for light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy. Approximately 5 d after pollination, pollen tubes reach sexually mature female gametophytes, which are coenocytic. At that time, a binucleate sperm cell is found within each pollen tube. Within 7 d of pollination, double fertilization events occur when each of two sperm nuclei released from a pollen tube fuses with a separate, undifferentiated female nucleus within the free nuclear female gametophyte, which lacks differentiated egg cells. The products of double fertilization are two viable zygotes; endosperm is not formed. The lack of differentiated egg cells in Gnetum gnemon is unparalleled among land plants and the documentation of a regularly occurring process of double fertilization is congruent with the hypothesis that a rudimentary process of double fertilization evolved in a common ancestor of angiosperms and Gnetales.",Double fertilization; Evolution; Female gametophyte; Gnetales; Gnetum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242831981

The patterns of selection were reasonably consistent across three field seasons, with strong directional selection for increased flower production in all three years, weaker selection for increased ovule number per flower in two years, and selection for increased flower size in one year. The causes of the selection were investigated using path analysis combined with multiplicative fitness components. Increased flower production increased fruit production directly, and increased numbers of ovules per flower increased the number of seeds per fruit in all three years; pollinator visitation did not influence either of these fitness components. Increased flower size was associated with increases in both the number of fruit and the number of seeds per fruit in one year, with the latter relationship being stronger. Total lifetime seed production was affected more strongly by differences in fruit production than by differences in either the number of seeds per field or the proportion of fertilized seeds that were viable, but all three fitness components were positively correlated with total seed production.",Lifetime fitness; multiplicative fitness components; natural selection gradients; path analysis; Raphanus raphanistrum; wild radish,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661299

Sepal initiation is helical in all three genera, which however differ in whether the first sepal is initiated in median abaxial position (Senna), or abaxial and off-median (Cassia javanica), a rare character \- state among legumes. Order of petal initiation varies: helical in Senna vs. unidirectional in Cassia and Chamaecrista. Both stamen whorls are uniformly unidirectional. Intergeneric ontogenetic differences occur in phyllotaxy, inflorescence architecture, bracteole formation, overlap of initiation among organ whorls (calyx/corolla in Cassia; two stamen whorls in Chamaecrista), eccentric initiation on one side of a flower, anther attachment, anther pore structure, and precocious carpel initiation in Senna. The asymmetric corolla and androecium in Chamaecrista arise by precocious organ initiation on one side (left or right). The poricidal anther character can result from differing developmental pathways: lateral slits vs. sealing of lateral sutures; clasping hairs vs. sutural ridges; terminal pores (one or two) vs. none; and clamp layer formation internally that prevents lateral dehiscence.

This 'floral constancy' has classically been explained as a learned behavior by which bees avoid wasting time switching between handling techniques. Choice trails were given to Bombus vagans workers that were freely foraging in mixed and pure fields of Trifolium pratense, T. repens, Viccia cracca, and Prunella vulgaris. Contrary to expectation, (1) bees showed if anything a stronger preference for their flower type in pure fields where they lacked experience than in a mixed field where they had had the opportunity to learn, (2) there was greater constancy in a mixed field of the two morphologically similar Trifolium species than in a mixed field of the morphologically disparate T. pratense and P. vulgaris, and (3) bees were more willing to switch between flowers or distinct morphologies when the colors were similar than between flowers of distinct colors when the morphologies were similar.

Leaf surface topography directly affects microhabitat availability for colonizing microbes, microhabitat quality and acceptability for insects, and the efficacy of agricultural spray applications. Prior detailed mechanistic studies that examined particular fungi-plant and pollinator-plant interactions have demonstrated the importance of plant surface topography or roughness in determining the outcome of the interactions. Until now, however, it has not been possible to measure accurately the topography-i.e., the three-dimensional structure-of such leaf surfaces or to record precise changes in patterns of leaf surface elevation over time. Using contact mode atomic force microscopy, we measured three-dimensional coordinates of upper leaf surfaces of Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), a perennial plant, on leaves of two age classes. We then produced topographic maps of these leaf surfaces, which revealed striking differences between age classes of leaves: old leaves have much rougher surfaces than those of young leaves. Atomic force microscope measurements were analyzed by lag (1) autocorrelation estimates of leaf surfaces by age class. We suggest that the changes in topography result from removal of epicuticular lipids and that the changes in leaf surface topography influence phylloplane ecology.

All patients underwent the following diagnostic procedures; anamnestic evaluation with an internal questionnaire, physical examination, SPT with commercially available allergenic extracts (DHS-Bayropharm Milan Italy); sNPT, NsBPT, and serum specific IgE determinations were also carried out in three groups of 50 different subjects. The results of our study show a highly relevant intensity of SPT positivity (++++ and +++ in about 95% of patients). The age of onset of clinical symptoms ranged between 20-25 years, and the majority of P monosensitized patients were born in the spring months, with an early exposure to P allergens. Rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma, alone or in association, represent the most common clinical manifestation of this allergy. The season in which patients experience clinical symptoms is prevalently spring (75, 12%). However, many people show a multiseasonal pattern (18, 55%). The frequency of SPT positivity to P allergens is increasing in the last 15 years, probably due to increased urban air pollution. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the high frequency and severity of the pollinosis and seem to confirm some epidemiological aspects connected with other allergenic pollens (birth during the seasonal period of pollination and association with a high urban air pollution).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029877966

The pollinator-exclusion experiments show that H. spinosa, under natural conditions, does not produce seed by apomixis or spontaneous autogamy. H. spinosa appears to be self-incompatible but slightly geitonogamous. Thus, his plant species needs pollen vectors for reproduclion. The resulls of the wind-exclusion experiments performed during two different years in two populations of H. spinosa support the hypothesis that the wind acts as a pollen vector; flowers excluded from the wind had a lower fruit set and female fertility than flowers excluded from all pollinator insects (winged and wingless). This generalist pollination system (inects and wind) permits this species to colonize and sustain viable populations in high mountains, where this species is the only woody shrub living above 3000 m above sea level in the Sierra Nevada.",Cruciferae; High-mountain ecology; Hormathophylla spinosa; Sierra Nevada; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030446891

Most of these studies have focused on physiological and growth responses of plants to increased UV-B, but these measures may not be closely related to future survival of plant populations. We examined the effects of two of different levels of increased UV-B on total female fitness, including seed number and quality, in rapid-cycling strains of Brassica nigra and B. rapa (Brassicaceae). We also measured the effects of UV-B on fitness components, particularly those related to pollination success. Two separate experiments, examining two different levels of UV-B, were performed. Sixty plants of each species were grown under control and enhanced levels of UV-B for a total of 480 plants (60 plantsx2 speciesx2 UV- B levelsx2 experiments). Increased UV-B was generally detrimental to growth and flowering in both species; however, total seed production was actually greater at higher UV-B doses in three of four dose/plant species combinations examined. UV-B had little effect on pollination success or offspring quality in either species. Therefore, in spite of the detrimental effects of UV-B on growth and flowering that we found, there is little evidence that fitness of these plant species would suffer with increasing UV-B, and we caution against using solely physiological or growth measurements to infer effects of UV-B on plant population fitness.",Brassica; Female fitness; Pollination; Seed number and quality; Ultraviolet radiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661217

It is shown here that within the style of tobacco, pollination-induced cell deterioration was restricted to the transmitting tissue while the surrounding cortical tissue was not affected. It was distinct from general senescence since exogenously applying the senescence-inducing hormone ethylene, or its precursor aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), to the flower or the pistil induced overall deterioration in the entire flower. Furthermore, both pollen tube growth and ethylene action were needed for the entire spectrum of cellular changes associated with this pollination-induced transmitting tissue deterioration process. It is also shown that pollination-induced mRNA poly(A) tail-shortening for at least three major classes of transmitting tissue-specific mRNAs. As is commonly observed for poly(A) tail-shortened mRNAs, the levels of two of these three mRNA classes decline after pollination. On the other hand, the third class of mRNAs, transmitting tissue-specific (TTS) mRNAs, was maintained at a very high level subsequent to pollination, even after substantial poly(A)-tail shortening. TTS mRNAs encode a pollen tube growth-promoting and -attracting protein needed for optimal in vivo pollen tube growth. The specific preservation of TTS mRNAs in the deteriorating transmitting tissue cells suggests that these cells can distinguish molecules needed in the pollinated styles from those that are dispensable, and protect them from degradation. It is suggested that the pollination-induced mRNA poly(A) tail-shortening and cell death are programmed processes suited to the post-pollination transmitting tissue environment. Results showing that ACC is a candidate signal molecule for the pollination-induced mRNA-shortening which is accentuated by ethylene and mediated via a protein phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathway are also presented.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030139998

Cross-pollinations were performed both within and between populations in order to examine the scale at which the genetic load is distributed. We found significant inbreeding depression in M. guttatus in four of the six traits, with the highest inbreeding depression observed in biomass (68% and 69% based on within- and between-population crosses, respectively) and lowest in ovule production (21% based on between-population crosses only). M. micranthus displayed significant inbreeding depression in only two of the six traits examined.

An estimate of total inbreeding depression based on the multiplicative effects of all traits was also lower in M. micanthus than in M. guttatus. Our results are consistent with the expected purging of genetic load in populations with high selfing rates. The absence of inbreeding depression in M. micranthus pollen and ovule production, two traits with strong links to fitness in a selfing annual, further suggests the important role of directional selection in determining the population's genetic load.

In the tropics, many plants offer housing and food for their specialized ant partners which, in return, offer benefit in the form of defence and/or nutrients, thus forming mutualistic bonds. Such ant-plants, also called myrmecophytes, occur together at a local scale, generating community patterns of mutualistic ant-plant associations. Here, we present the first fully quantitative description of an ant-myrmecophyte community. 2. The study site in Central Amazonian tropical rainforest had a high myrmecophyte density of about 380 ind. ha-1. Sixteen myrmecophyte and 25 ant species were recorded, the species abundance rank curves being highly uneven. 3. The ant-myrmecophyte matrix was highly compartmentalized, and a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the observed pattern was not a product of chance and sample size (P &lt; 0-0001). Cluster analyses indicated that compartments were partially explained by occurrence of the ants in phylogenetically related host plants, but not by habitat specificity. 4. The connectance of the ant-plant community was 12%. This value seems quite low when compared with published results from other mutualistic systems (pollinator and seed-dispersor), after controlling for the total number of interacting species. The high frequency of null interactions in the ant-myrmecophyte system could not be explained by the 'phenological non-coincidence hypothesis', since both ant and plant partners occur together throughout the year. 5. Ant-plant interactions were highly asymmetrical: ant species had fewer partners than plant species and ants were more dependent on the plants than the reverse. These asymmetries are in the opposite direction to those recorded for plant-pollinators and plant-dispersors; however, they seem to be the product of the same underlying process: differential fitness benefits between mutualistic partners. 6. The low number of ant and plant partners per compartment, coupled with an apparently high temporal and spatial stability of ant-myrmecophyte interactions, suggests that compartments are the appropriate scale at which to investigate coevolution in ant-myrmecophyte systems.",Ant-plants; Coevolution; Community; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029751245

Previous studies on tristylous Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae) indicate that reduced seed set following self-pollination generally occurs in the short- (S), but not the long-(L) or mid-styled (M) morphs. To determine whether this pattern results from morph-specific differences in inbreeding depression owing to the sheltering of deleterious alleles at the S locus and/or partial self-incompatibility, we conducted controlled hand-pollinations of the floral morphs and measured seed set and levels of seed abortion. There were no significant differences in fertilization success and seed set following self-, illegitimate, and legitimate pollinations in the L and M morphs. In contrast, in the S morph self-, intramorph and intermorph illegitimate pollinations resulted in significant reduction in seed set in comparison with legitimate pollination. This indicates that the reduced seed set observed in self-pollination is the result of partial incompatibility rather than inbreeding depression. Significantly reduced fertilization success and low levels of ovule abortion in illegitimate pollinations of S plants also supported this conclusion. Reduced fertility in the S morph may have implications for the observed loss of this morph from natural populations and the evolutionary breakdown of tristyly.",Eichhornia paniculata; Floral morphs; Inbreeding depression; Partial incompatibility; Pontederiaceae; Self-pollination; Style morphs; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030480357

First, we crossed a wild gourd (Cucurbita texana) to a cultivated zucchini (Cucurbita pepo cv 'Black Beauty') to produce an F1 and then an F2 generation. Half of the F1 seeds were produced by depositing small loads of C. texana pollen onto the stigmas of C. pepo. These small pollen loads were insufficient to produce a full complement of seeds and, consequently, both the fast- and the slow-growing pollen tubes were permitted to achieve fertilization. An F2 generation was then produced by depositing small loads of F1 pollen onto stigmas of F1 plants. The F2 seeds resulting from two generations of small pollen loads are termed 'the non- selected line' because there was little or no selection for pollen-tube growth rate on these plants. The other half of the F1 and F2 seeds were produced by depositing large pollen loads (&gt;10000 pollen grains) onto stigmas and then allowing only the first 1% or so of the pollen tubes that entered the ovary to fertilize the ovules. We did this by excising the styles at the ovary at 12- 15 h after pollination. The resulting F2 seeds are termed 'the selected line' because they were produced by two generations of selection for only the fastest growing pollen tubes. Small pollen loads from the F2 plants, both the selected and the non-selected lines, were then deposited onto stigmas of different C. pepo flowers, and the vigor of the resulting seeds was compared under greenhouse and field conditions. The results showed that the seeds fertilized by pollen from the selected line had greater vegetative vigor as seedlings and greater flower and fruit production as mature plants than the seeds fertilized by pollen from the non-selected line. This study demonstrates that selection for fast pollen-tube growth (selection on the microgametophyte) leads to a correlated increase in sporophyte (progeny) vigor.",Cucurbita pepo; Cucurbita texana; Microgametophyte selection; Pollen competition; Pollen selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029787487

Plants were grown in a greenhouse under three biologically effective UV-B levels that simulated either an ambient stratospheric ozone level (control), 16% (""low enhanced""), or 32% (""high enhanced"") ozone depletion levels at Morgantown, WV, USA in mid-March. In the first experiment, we examined whether UV-B level during plant growth influenced in vivo pollen production and viability, and flower production. Pollen production and viability per flower were reduced by ?50% under both enhanced UV-B levels relative to ambient controls. While plants under high-enhanced UV-B produced over 40% more flowers than plants under the two lower UV-B treatments, whole-plant production of viable pollen was reduced under high-enhanced UV-B to 17% of that of ambient controls. Whole-plant production of viable pollen was reduced under low-enhanced UV-B to 34% of ambient controls. In the second experiment, we collected pollen from plants under the three UV-B levels and examined whether source-plant UV-B exposure influenced in vitro pollen germination and viability. Pollen from plants under both enhanced-UV-B treatments had initially lower germination and viability than pollen from the ambient level. After in vitro exposure to the high-enhanced UV-B levels for 6 h, viability of the pollen from plants grown under ambient UV-B was reduced from 65 to 18%. In contrast, viability of the pollen from plants grown under both enhanced UV-B treatments was reduced to a much lesser extent: only from ?43 to 22%. Thus ambient source-plant pollen was more sensitive to enhanced UV-B exposure. In the third experiment, we used pollen collected from source plants under the three UV-B levels to fertilize plants growing under ambient-UV-B levels, and assessed subsequent seed production and germination. Seed abortion rates were higher in plants pollinated with pollen from the enhanced UV-B treatments, than from ambient UV-B. Despite this, seed yield (number and mass) per plant was similar regardless of the UV-B exposure of their pollen source. Our findings demonstrate that enhanced UV-B levels associated with springtime ozone depletion events have the capacity to substantially reduce viable pollen production, and could ultimately reduce reproductive success of B. rapa.",Brassica rapa; Ozone depletion; Pollen; Seed yield; UV-B radiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001429602

F., Mexico","Drought is an important climatic phenomenon which, after soil infertility, ranks as the second most severe limitation to maize production in developing countries. When drought stress occurs just before or during the flowering period, a delay in silking is observed, resulting in an increase in the length of the anthesis-silking interval (ASI) and in a decrease in grain yield. Selection for reduced ASI in tropical open pollinated varieties has been shown to be correlated with improved yields under drought stress. Since efficient selection for drought tolerance requires carefully managed experimental conditions, molecular markers were used to identify the genomic segments responsible for the expression of ASI, with the final aim of developing marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies. An F2 population of 234 individuals was genotyped at 142 loci and F3 families were evaluated in the field under several water regimes for male flowering (MFLW), male sterility (STER), female flowering (FFLW) and ASI. The genetic variance of ASI increased as a function of the stress intensity, and the broad- sense heritabilites of MFLW, FFLW and ASI were high under stress conditions, being 86%, 82% and 78%, respectively. Putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the expression of MFLW and/or FFLW under drought were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10, accounting for around 48% of the phenotypic variance for both traits. For ASI, six putative QTLs were identified under drought on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 10, and together accounted for approximately 47% of the phenotypic variance. Under water- stress conditions, four QTLs were common for the expression of MFLW and FFLW, one for the expression of ASI and MFLW, and four for the expression of ASI and FFLW. The number of common QTLs for two traits was related to the level of linear correlation between these two traits. Segregation for ASI was found to be transgressive with the drought-susceptible parent contributing alleles for reduced ASI (4 days) at two QTL positions. Alleles contributed by the resistant line at the other four QTLs were responsible for a 7- day reduction of ASI. These four QTLs represented around 9% of the linkage map, and were stable over years and stress levels. It is argued that MAS based on ASI QTLs should be a powerful tool for improving drought tolerance of tropical maize inbred lines.",Anthesis-silking interval; Drought; Quantitative trait loci; RFLP; Tropical maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029739388

We present the cloning and characterization of two SI genes from the Fuji apple (Malus X domestica Borkh.). A cDNA library from the carpels of mature flowers was constructed and two clones, SIF1 and SIF2, which exhibit a strong homology to previously cloned SI genes, were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of SIF1 is identical to that of the S9 gene of an apple cultivar, Wellington. Whereas, the SIF2 sequence is unique and shows a significant homology to the reported SI genes of other apple cultivars. The SIF2 cDNA clone consists of 937 nucleotides which contain a coding region of 226 amino acid residues, 47 nucleotides of the 5? untranslated region, 192 nucleotides of the 3? untranslated region, and a poly(A)+ tail. The expression pattern of the clones was studied by cDNA blot analysis using cDNA libraries of various organs. The result showed that the apple SI clones were expressed in the carpel but not in other organs. Using these clones, we have studied the pedigree groups of various apple cultivars. A portion of the SI genes, amplified from the genomic DNA of 9 different apple cultivars and four related species, was hybridized with either SIF1 or SIF2.

We tested whether safe sites for germination and seedling establishment are limiting for the twig epiphyte, Tolumnia variegata, by manipulating fruit set and monitoring subsequent seedling establishment for two seasons (1991-1992, 1992-1993). In the Cambalache Forest Reserve of Puerto Rico, we established 36 plots along a transect. Each plot consisted of nine trees. A center tree was designated as the site for attaching Tolumnia and manipulating fruit set. The other eight potential host trees were 1-3 and 3-5 m from the center tree in each of the cardinal directions. A 1-m length of stem 1 m from the ground was monitored for recruits on each of the nine trees of 24 fruit-enhanced plots and 12 controls (23 and 13, respectively for the 1992-1993 season). Fruit enhancement plots were divided among two treatments: one-fruit and five-fruit additions for the 1 st year and one to five and more than five fruits for the 2nd year. Availability of suitable host species was not limiting. T. variegata showed little specificity for host tree species, good host trees and shrubs were common, and there was no evidence that the orchid had a preference for small branches, despite possessing the entire suite of characteristics thought to represent ""obligate"" twig epiphytes. Fruit enhancement increased seed rain and seedling establishment consistently in only the high-fruit treatment plots. Most recruitment occurred near fruiting plants. Over the 2-year period, mortality was 18% for adults and 85.5% for the 1991-1992 cohort of recruits. Net recruitment was positive for both the treatment (average = 1.74) and control plots (average = 0.67). Seedling establishment at our study site was not microsite-limited.

Research Centre, Dept. of Conserv. and Land Mgmt., P.O. Box 51, Wanneroo, WA 6065, Australia","The Epacridaceae of Western Australia comprise 181 named species distributed in 17 genera. One hundred and seventy seven species (98% of the total) and ten genera are endemic to the region. Within Western Australia, all members are confined to the south, with a bimodal pattern of species diversity centred on the sandplains and uplands around the Stirling Ranges and Mount Lesueur. Leucopogon, the largest genus, reflects this pattern, however, species diversity is greatest on the south coastal sandplains. All species are woody shrubs, mostly found on neutral or acidic sandy soils. Plants of at least 120 species are killed by fire; Astroloma contains the only significant number of resprouting species. Although some species are in flower every month every year, autumn/winter flowering is a common feature of many members of the family. All species are biotically pollinated. Bird pollination is found in 18 species in six genera. The remaining species are insect pollinated. Bees are the major pollinators in Leucopogon, Conostephium and Coleanthera. Moths and butterflies are important pollinators in Andersonia, Leucopogon, Lysinema and Styphelia. Flies are minor pollinators of some species of Andersonia, Leucopogon and Monotoca. All species studied are protandrous and outbreeding, with only Cosmelia being capable of self pollination. Fruits are fleshy in Astroloma, Brachrloma, Croninia, in certain species of Leucopogon and Styphelia and are animal dispersed. Other genera have dry, dehiscent fruit with gravity or wind dispersed seeds. Many species have relatively narrow distribution ranges, 90 species having ranges of over 300 km, 54 species have ranges of 100-300 km and 37 have ranges of less than 100 km (and there are many undescribed species in this group). The conservation status of many species is still poorly known. Dieback disease is a major threat to the family, and could cause the extinction of several species in the wild. © 1996 Annals of Botany Company.",Biology; Conservation; Disease; Dispersal; Epacridaceae; Phytogeography; Pollination; Western Australia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001850240

This results in a heating of the flower's interior, which may improve the possibilities for insect pollination and seed production. Here, I examine whether flower heliotropism in an alpine population of the self-incompatible Ranunculus acris L. (Ranunculaceae) enhances pollinator visitation and seed production. Flowers of Ranunculus acris tracked the sun during the day. Tracking accuracy was greatest during the middle of the day. The temperature elevation in flowers was negatively correlated with the flower's angle of deviation from the sun. Despite the increased temperature, insects did not discriminate among flowers on the basis of their angle of deviation from the sun, or tend to stay longer in the flowers aligned closest towards the sun. A tethering experiment was conducted on three groups of plants flowering at different times in the 1993 season and on one group the following season. Manipulation plants were constrained not to track the sun, whereas control plants tracked the sun naturally. Solar tracking had no effect on seed:ovule ratio, seed mass, or abortion rate in any of the groups. There is probably a very narrow range of weather conditions (cold, sunny, and calm) where flower heliotropism may enhance visitation rate to flowers and their seed production.",Alpine habitat; Flower temperature; Heliotropic flowers; Pollination; Ranunculus acris; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030457059

Several field experiments on potatoes, using transgenes as markers, have shown that transgene dispersal by pollen to other potato plants is limited and very unlikely at distances over 10 m. In a recent study in Sweden, a frequency of transgene-containing progeny of over 30% is reported from non- transgenic potato plants grown at distances of 10-1000 m from transgenic plants containing nptII and gas marker genes. Data from the Swedish study is discussed along with other relevant observations, and it is concluded that the high frequency of gene dispersal in that study results from a high frequency of false positives during PCR analysis of the nptII gene.

Here I estimate the effective size of the genetic neighborhood, Nb, as a means of evaluating the likely role of genetic drift in creating genetic differentiation within a population of a marine plant, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass). Calculations of effective neighborhood size are based on field estimates of pollen and seed-dispersal distributions, an electrophoretic estimate of the mating system using open-pollinated progeny arrays, and determination of the effective density of reproductive individuals in the population. Neighborhood area calculated from the parent-offspring dispersal variances was equal to Na, = 524 m2; variance in the seed-dispersal distribution contributes more than twice as much as variance in pollen dispersal to Na. Including an outcrossing rate slightly different from random, estimated neighborhood size for Z. marina is Nb = 6255. This estimate is one of the largest reported for plants or animals and indicates that genetic drift in small neighborhoods is highly unlikely to cause genetic substructuring in the study population. High gene-flow levels provided by the marine environment appear to prevent genetic isolation by distance among eelgrass patches, but the importance of drift through founder events in this population characterized by high patch turnover cannot be discounted and is the subject of ongoing study.",Gene flow; Genetic drift; Neighborhood size; Pollen dispersal; Seed dispersal; Zostera marina,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029768383

These plantings may benefit agriculture if native plant species provide resources for insects that parasitize crop pests. We examined a number of prairie plant species to determine whether they provided nectar resources that could be used by Macrocentrus grandii, a wasp parasitoid of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner). Individual wasps were caged with particular prairie species and wasp lifespan was measured. Of 11 plant species tested, 8 significantly increased M. grandii longevity and three had no effect. The flowers of species which did not increase longevity either produced little nectar or had very deep corolla tubes, making the nectar inaccessible to the short mouthparts of this wasp. The data suggest that plant species which have flowers with very short corolla tubes or no corolla tube (cup-shaped flowers) have the greatest potential to be of benefit to M. grandii. M. grandii has two generations in Iowa, synchronized with the two generations of Ostrinia nubilalis. Only plant species that bloom during these two flight periods could potentially be used by M. granditi. A phenology data base was compiled on all Iowa prairie plant species, based on literature sources and our monitoring of two prairie sites in central Iowa. This database also includes information on corolla depth, type of pollinator that visits the species, and whether the species is planted along roadsides.

Males produced more flowers and invested more biomass in flowers than females. Both sexes attracted insects with fragrance, pollen and very small amounts of nectar. Insect visitation was limited. Breeding system experiments found wind-pollination to be minimal compared to unmanipulated open pollination. Hand-pollination increased fruit set, suggesting pollen limitation.

We found that the reproductive effort of female Silene latifolia plants increased to more than twice that of male plants or female plants that were prevented from setting fruit by lack of pollination after 4 weeks of flowering. Whole-plant source/sink ratios of pollinated females were significantly lower than those of males or unpollinated females because of investment in fruit. We hypothesized that these differences in source/sink ratio between the sexes and within females, depending on pollination, would lead to differences in leaf photosynthetic rates. Within females, we found that photosynthetic capacity was consistent with measurement of whole-plant source/sink ratio. Females that were setting fruit had 30% higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates by 28 days after flowering than females that were not setting fruit. Males, however, had consistently higher photosynthetic rates than females from 10 days after flowering onwards. Males also had approximately twice the dark respiration rates of fruiting females. We found that female reproductive structures are longer-lived and contribute more carbon to their own support than male reproductive structures. Despite the higher rates of leaf dark respiration and lower calyx photosynthetic rates, males fix more carbon than do females. We conclude that females have a sink-regulated mechanism of photosynthesis that allows them to respond to variations in fruit set. This mechanism is not, however, sufficient to explain why male S. latifolia plants have higher rates of photosynthesis, higher source/sink ratios, and lower reproductive allocation, but fail to grow larger than female plants.",Flower photosynthesis; Physiological dimorphism; Reproductive effort; Silene latifulia; Source/sink,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668411

Fitness components of adult females and hermaphrodites in nature, of their open-pollinated progeny, and of experimental selfs and outcrosses onto hermaphrodites were compared in endemic Hawaiian Bidens sandvicensis, all of whose known populations are gynodioecious, consisting of a mixture of females and hermaphrodites. Multilocus selfing rates of hermaphrodites were also estimated, and sex morph ratio monitored over four seasons in three populations of B. sandvicensis and one population of gynodioecious B. cervicata. Total mean inbreeding depression in seed set (in the glasshouse), germination rate (in an open-air nursery on Kauai), and first year survivorship and fecundity in the field were estimated as 0.94 (SE 0.04), and occurred primarily in drought months. Lower survivorship and fecundity of selfs were partially explained by their consistently smaller size. Open-pollinated seed of females had significantly lower germination rate, proportion flowering, and fecundity than outcrossed progeny of hermaphrodites, suggesting moderate biparental inbreeding in females and a lack of any non-outcrossing advantage to progeny of females. In all fitness components, open-pollinated progeny of hermaphrodites were inferior to those of females and to outcrosses, and in most components were superior to selfs. Total performance of open-pollinated progeny of females relative to those of hermaphrodites was calculated as 2.3 (SE = 0.4), but since inflorescences of females also set 20% to 50% more seed than those of hermaphrodites, their total relative ovule success was estimated as 3.2 (SE = 0.5). If inheritance of male sterility is nuclear, this superiority is sufficient to maintain females in frequencies over 20% in populations, whose actual frequencies ranged from 14% to 33%. In four populations, selfing rates of hermaphrodites, assayed in seedlings, were 0.50, 0.45, 0.25, and 0.30, but since substantial inbreeding depression occurred prior to germination, the mean selfing rate of hermaphrodite ovules exceeded 0.57. Female frequencies were significantly higher in the two populations with higher hermaphrodite selfing rate.

Moreover pathogens of increased virulence and dramatic environmental changes are currently spreading or emerging. The objectives of the present paper, measuring genetic variability and studying its pattern of distribution, are crucial steps to optimize sampling strategies in the search of genotypes that tolerate or resist these threatening factors within the huge array of Citrus and Citrus related species. Their intraspecific and intrageneric variability was studied comparatively by means of ten enzymatic systems using eight different measures. The analysis of ten enzymatic systems allowed us to distinguish all the species and all but one artificial hybrid. The species with the lowest genotypic variability are C. myrtifolia, C. deliciosa (willow leaf mandarin), C. paradisi (grapefruit), C. limon (lemon) and C. sinensis (sweet orange), while Severinia buxifolia shows the highest value.

Lemons (C. limon, C. meyeri, C. karna, C. volkameriana), limes (C. aurantifolia, C. limettioides, C. lattifolia) and C. bergamia show a very high percentage of heterozygosity which indicates an origin through interspecific hybridization. Two main factors limit genetic intraspecific variability: apomictic reproduction, where nucellar embryos are much more vigorotis than the zygotic ones, and nurserymen selecting against variability in the seedling stage of the rootstocks or in propagating the scion cultivars vegetatively. Additionally, self-pollination appears in some species mainly used as rootstocks which would explain their low heterozygosity values. Genetic differences between species and genera are in general high, which suggests that adaptation might have played an important role during the evolution of the orange subfamily.",Citrus; Fortunella; Genetic diversity; Germ plasm bank; Heterozygosity; Isozymes; Poncirus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030450208

This is not surprising because the selfing rates are similar enough that it is unlikely that the populations have been characterized for long periods of time by these different inbreeding levels.",Collinsia heterophylla; Inbreeding coefficient; Inbreeding depression; Outcrossing rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029772625

There was a wide range in the bloom period of the different cultivars. 'Eldorado' and 'Bosc' pollen had the best viability. Pollen from 'Bartlett,' Pyrus calleryana and 'Nijissecki' induced the most fruit set in 1990; however, there was no difference in 1991 or 1993. By hand pollinating, no relation was seen between pollen viability and fruit set. It is suggested that for best fruit set in 'Anjou' orchards, hand pollination should be practiced and/or the orchards should have at least 3 pollenizer varieties covering 'Anjou' bloom period. Seed numbers were highest in fruit that had been pollinated with pollen from 'Old Home' x 'Farmingdale' (OH x F) 333 and OH x F 69. Fruit size was different only in 1991 when the largest was from flowers receiving pollen from 'Nijissecki,' 'Anjou' or OH x F 333. Fruit size was not related to seed number.

However, no specific scientific data about its role in causing allergic diseases are available. Objective - To study the role of pecan tree pollen in the development of allergy. Methods - The presence of pecan tree pollen was determined by weekly and monthly counting of airborne grains. The incidence of pecan tree pollen atopy and clinical manifestations were studied in 395 participants, aged 4-70 years, who comprised 78.2% of the whole eligible population of a rural community. The participants were skin tested for different extracts of allergens, completed detailed questionnaires, and their medical files were evaluated. Results - During May, pecan tree pollen grains comprised 70% of the total airborne grains. A positive skin-prick test (SPT) to pecan was shown by 46 (11.6%) participants, constituting 25.4% of the atopic population. Of those who were found atopic to one or more allergens 50.3% had symptoms, whereas the parallel figure for those atopic to pecan pollen was 76.1% (P < 0.005); 58.7% of the pecan atopic participants had hay fever, 43.5% had asthma, and 31.5% had both hay fever and asthma. Among pecan atopic participants the incidence of hay fever increased with age (P = 0.05), while the incidence of bronchial asthma, as a sole manifestation of allergy, decreased in the > 17-year-old age group (P < 0.01). Of the pecan atopics 65.2% had clinical symptoms coinciding only with the pecan pollen season and an additional 10.9% had perennial symptoms. Conclusion - Pecan tree releases highly allergenic pollen grains, which are correlated to the incidence of hay fever in the exposed population. The contribution of pecan tree pollen to the symptoms was highly significant after discounting olive and cypress trees that also pollinate in the spring. In children, the pecan tree constitutes a possible etiologic agent for the development of asthma.",Asthma; Atopy; Cypress; Hay fever; Olive; Pecan; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029965995

Underlying mutualism is an intrinsic conflict between the parties, in that each is under selection for increased exploitation of the other. Theoretical models suggest that this conflict is a source of evolutionary instability, and that evolution of 'cheating' by one party may lead to reciprocal extinction. Here we present phylogenetic evidence for reversal of an obligate mutualism: within the yucca moth complex, distinct cheater species derived from obligate pollinators inflict a heavy cost on their yucca hosts by laying their eggs but not pollinating the yucca. Phylogenetic data show the cheaters to have existed for a long time. Coexisting pollinators and cheaters are not sister taxa, supporting predictions that evolution of cheating within a single pollinator is evolutionarily unstable. Several lines of evidence support a hypothesis that host shifts preceded the reversal of obligate mutualism. Host or partner shifts is a mechanism that can provide a route of evolutionary escape among obligate mutualists in general.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666929

Correlation was obtained between the attraction of beetles to colour-traps and the colours of host-plant flowers. Three pollinator guilds were defined on colour preferences and feeding behaviour. A blue/white pollinator guild comprising species of Anisomyx Fabricius and Peritrichia Burmeister were attracted to blue and white traps, and pollinated blue-violet and white flowers. These beetles feed on pollen (and possibly on nectar) and do not imbed themselves in flowers. This, together with their dense pilosity and frequent flower visitation rates, suggests that they are important pollinators. A second embedding guild consists of the genera Scelophysa Gyllenhal, Heterochelus Burmeister, Gymnoloma Peringuey, Heterochelus Burmeister and Pachycnema Burmeister. These beetles show pronounced sexual dimorphism and are relatively free of hair. They characteristically embed in species of Asteraceae and Mesembryanthemaceae, feeding on the ray florets, ovule and pollen. They probably have a limited role as pollinators. A third pollen- feeding guild is intermediate between these two guilds. It comprises species of Lepithrix Serville which, like the members of the embedding guild, select red, yellow, orange and white pigments and flowers.

Here we examine the effects of flower number and size on visitation to wild radish by two taxa of pollinators over 3 years, using a combination of multiple regression and experimental reductions in both traits. We found strong, consistent evidence that increases in both flower number and size cause increased visitation by syrphid flies. The results for small bees were harder to interpret, because the multiple regression and experimental manipulation results did not agree. It is likely that increased flower size causes a weak increase in small-bee visitation, but strong relationships between flower number and small-bee visitation seen in 2 years of observational studies were not corroborated by experimental manipulation of this trait. Small bees may actually have responded to an unmeasured trait correlated with flower number, or lower small-bee abundances when the flower number manipulation was conducted may have reduced our ability to detect a causal relationship.

One group of females was outcrossed 10-14 d after anthesis, a second group was never outcrossed, and a third group, the control, consisted of females that were outcrossed as soon as stigmas appeared. Stigma length was significantly greater for plants in the delayed and never outcrossed groups compared to the control. Furthermore, stigmas of virgin flowers grew until they were either pollinated or the plants produced anthers. Plants that were never outcrossed produced their own anthers and self pollinated. The resulting progeny were all female. The sons of the delayed outcrossed group produced more stamens, on average, than sons of the control group. The observed male-biased sex ratio among the progeny of delayed outcrossed plants could be due to gametic selection. To test for this, plants were held virgin until their stigmas reached a length of at least 3 mm. These stigmas were then pollinated either distally or proximally. No significant difference was found between the progeny sex ratios of these two J treatments. However, both sex ratios were more male biased than progeny of plants pollinated the day of anthesis (control group of the first experiment).

Female agaonine fig wasps enter Ficus fruits (figs), where they pollinate the flowers and oviposit into the ovaries of a proportion of the flowers via their styles. The fig trees are totally dependent on these fig wasps for sexual reproduction, as the wasps fertilize the figs' seeds and transfer pollen between trees, while the wasps need the fig trees' ovaries as feeding sites (galled seeds) for their progeny. Since the wasp progeny destroy seeds, the question arises as to why selection has not led to increasingly higher fig wasp fecundities and the eventual collapse of the mutualism. 2. The stability of the mutualism could be maintained by pollinators having short ovipositors, restricting oviposition to short-styled flowers so that long-styled flowers produce seeds. However, in most of the monoecious Ficus species where measurements were taken, pollinators generally possessed ovipositors of sufficient length to reach the ovaries of a large majority of the flowers. This was confirmed by the presence of pollinator progeny in flowers with long styles. 3. Complete seed destruction may also be avoided by a proportion of fig ovaries being inviolate to oviposition by fig wasps, independent of their style lengths. However, experimental increases in pollinator foundresses per fig in F. burtt-davyi showed that all the ovaries that could be reached by the wasps' ovipositors were potentially exploitable by agaonine fig wasps. 4. Relative production of wasps and seeds was found to be largely dependent on the interplay between the number of eggs inside each wasp, the number of accessible ovaries in individual figs, and the average number of foundresses entering each fig. On average, there were not enough foundresses entering each tig to utilize all accessible ovaries. 5. Possible factors affecting the total entry numbers of wasps into figs include ostiolar closure rates and wasp population densities in the areas surrounding fig trees. As many ovaries remain unused because of a frequent shortage of wasp eggs per fig, fig trees can continue to produce enough seeds for the continued evolutionary stability of the fig-fig wasp mutualism.",Agaonidae; Ficus; Mutualism; Ovipositors; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666930

Fruit set per flower and seed set per fruit declined through time within plants. Hand pollination experiments showed that this was not due to increasing pollen limitation. Nutrient supplementation had little effect on seed output, but leaf clipping reduced seed production, especially in late-blooming flowers, and removal of early-blooming flowers increased seed set by later flowers. Thus, the temporal pattern of seed output was due to declining availability of photosynthates. Plants with larger bulbs produced larger inflorescences, a greater proportion of hermaphrodite flowers, more fruits per hermaphrodite flower, and more seeds per fruit, but lost a greater fraction of their initial bulb mass as a consequence of fruiting. After controlling for the effects of bulb mass, plants with larger inflorescences produced a greater proportion of male flowers, and plants with more hermaphrodite flowers produced fewer fruits per hermaphrodite flower and fewer seeds per fruit. Thus, the female fitness gain curve was decelerating. The temporal decline in seed output provides a partial explanation for the parallel decline in allocation to pistils. However, a complete explanation for the pattern of gamete packaging requires an understanding of factors controlling male, as well as female, fitness.",Andromonoecy; Female allocation; Female fitness; Fitness gain curves; Fruit set; Liliaceae; Seed set; Zigadenus paniculatus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661660

The plant was the Indica-type rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Chinsurah Boro II. The analysed material was: (1) microspore-derived embryogenic rice cells grown in suspension culture, (2) transgenic plants recovered from protoplasts produced from the cultured cells and (3) the self-pollination progeny (two successive generations) of the transgenic plants. DNA purified from samples of these materials was PCR-amplified with different random oligonucleotide primers and the amplification products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Band polymorphism was scored and used in band-sharing analyses to produce a similarity matrix. Relationships among the analysed genomes were expressed in a dendrogram. The extensive DNA changes evidenced in cultured cells demonstrate the occurrence of somaclonal variation in the material used to produce protoplasts for gene transfer. Quantitatively reduced DNA changes were also found in the resulting transgenic plants and in their self-pollination progenies. While confirming the stability of the foreign gene in transgenic plants, this work gives molecular evidence for the occurrence of stable genomic changes in transgenic plants and points to in vitro cell culture as the causative agent. RAPDs are shown to be a convenient tool to detect and estimate the phenomenon at the molecular level.

Individuals were cloned, hand-pollinated and allowed to mature seed at one of two temperatures. Second-generation plants were induced to seed-set at four times during the flowering season. The effects of grandparental temperature (GPT), parental flowering time (PFT) and maternal family (MFAM) on seed size, germination, leaf area and allometry, flowering time and male sterility in third generation plants were then measured. GPT significantly affected all adult traits and did so more strongly than and often independently of seed weight and germination. The data suggest that heritable GPT effects arise from gametophytic selection or genomic modification. Significant GPT x MFAM interactions were detected for seed weight, leaf area, flowering time, and male sterility. Such genotype-specific responses are necessary if parental temperature is to influence the evolutionary divergence of life history and breeding patterns in populations growing in different temperature regimes.

The ploidy level of the hybrids ranged from 38 to 63 chromosomes. All hybrids developed flowers with violet petals except for one, hy-56, that possessed red petals. The colour of the tuber skin was purple in all hybrids except in hy-56 where the tuber skin was red. All of the hybrids were female fertile and generated viable seeds. Near-tetraploid hybrids produced the highest number of seeds per fruit and these seeds had it normal size. Hybrids with 58 or more chromosomes produced smaller seeds and less seeds per fruit. The germination frequency of the seeds was not influenced by the chromosome number of the hybrids. Pollen viability was determined and the male fertility of three hybrids was tested. Pollination with these three hybrids gave rise to fruit development, but only one produced viable seeds. The hybrids were tested for resistance to G. pallida pathotypes Pa2 and Pa3. A high level of resistance to Pa3, inherited from one parental clone. DHAK- 11, and a high level of resistance to Pa2, inherited from the other parental clone, DHAK-33, was combined in four hybrids.

Observations of birds feeding at flowers longer and shorter than their bills, however, and the lack of experimental evidence for any feeding advantage to short bills, seem to contradict this interpretation. I address this problem by considering a little-studied dimension of floral morphology: corolla diameter. In laboratory experiments on female ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), probing abilities (maximum extraction depths) increased with increasing corolla diameter. Handling times increased with decreasing corolla diameter, resulting in ""handling time equivalents"", i.e., flowers having the same handling times but different lengths and diameters. Longer-billed birds had greater maximum extraction depths and shorter handling times than shorter-billed birds at all corolla diameters greater than the width of the bill. In contrast, shorter-billed birds made fewer errors inserting their bills into narrow flowers. Hence, differences in bill lengths apparently are associated with trade-offs in foraging abilities, whereby longer-billed birds are able to feed at long flowers and may do so more quickly, whereas shorter-billed birds are able to feed more successfully at narrow flowers.",Feeding adaptation; Foraging behavior; Hummingbirds; Plant-pollinator interactions; Trochilidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030063047

Although allergen immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinitis, its role in treating asthma is unclear. Methods. We examined the efficacy of immunotherapy for asthma exacerbated by seasonal ragweed exposure. During an observation phase, adults with asthma who were sensitive to ragweed kept daily diaries and recorded peak expiratory flow rates between July and October. Those who reported seasonal asthma symptoms and medication use as well as decreased peak expiratory flow were randomly assigned to receive placebo or ragweed-extract immunotherapy in doses that increased weekly for an additional two years. Results. During the observation phase, the mean (±SE) peak expiratory flow rate measured in the morning during the three weeks representing the height of the pollination season was 454±20 liters per minute in the immunotherapy group and 444±16 liters per minute in the placebo group. Of the 77 patients who began the treatment phase, 64 completed one year of the study treatment and 63 completed two years. During the two treatment years, the mean peak expiratory flow rate was higher in the immunotherapy group (489±16 liters per minute, vs. 453±17 in the placebo group [P=0.06] during the first year, and 480±12 liters per minute, vs. 461±13 in the placebo group [P=0.03] during the second). Medication use was higher in the immunotherapy group than in the placebo group during observation and lower during the first treatment year (P=0.01) but did not differ in the two groups during the second year (P=0.7). Asthma-symptom scores were similar in the two groups (P=0.08 in year 1 and P=0.3 in year 2). The immunotherapy group had reduced hay-fever symptoms, skin-test sensitivity to ragweed, and sensitivity to bronchial challenges and increased IgG antibodies to ragweed as compared with the placebo group; there was no longer a seasonal increase in IgE antibodies to ragweed allergen in the immunotherapy group after two years of treatment.

Flower nectar robbers which extract flower rewards to pollinators but do not pollinate, may reduce the fitness of the plant. In this study we combined field observations and experimental manipulations to assess the role of a primary nectar robber, the bird Diglossa baritula, on flower nectar secretion and reproductive output of two hummingbird-pollinated plant species with contrasting breeding systems. We used the hermaphroditic Salvia mexicana and the androdioecious Fuchsia microphylla. In addition, because the distinction between pollinators and robbers is not so sharp, we compared the pollination efficiencies of D. baritula and of five species of humming-birds visiting the flowers of the same plant species. 2. Flowers of the two plant species were frequently robbed (92 and 37% of the flowers in Salvia mexicana and Fuchsia microphylla respectively). For both species, field censuses of robbed and unrobbed flowers showed no differences in fruit set. Experimentally induced nectar robbery did not affect the cumulative production of nectar in both plant species. However, in S. mexicana, but not in F. microphylla, intact flowers produced more concentrated nectar. 3. The role of D. baritula and hummingbirds on seed production per flower, was assessed by exposing individual flowers to different schedules of visitation by caged flower visitors. In S. mexicana, the number of seeds produced by flowers visited by the robber only was similar to that of flowers visited by the least efficient pollinator but lower than that of those visited by the other pollinators. 4. In F. microphylla, seed production by flowers visited by the robber only was lower than that of flowers visited by all other pollinators. 5. For both plant species visitation by the robber plus hummingbirds yielded a similar number of seeds as flowers visited by the more effective pollinator. 6. There was no field evidence that nectar robbery by D. baritula damages nectaries or ovules and, since under natural conditions flower visitation by the robber only was very rare, we conclude that for these two plant species D. baritula may be regarded as a commensal or even a low-efficiency pollinator.",Diglossa baritula; Fuchsia microphylla; Hummingbirds; Nectar robbery; Pollination efficiency; Salvia mexicana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029668083

To predict genetic consequences of the selection we developed a deterministic genetic model based on a classical ""supergene"" model, and we studied the effects of pollinator availability and inbreeding depression on temporal changes of morph frequencies through model simulation. Because of the severe pollinator limitation experienced by the population, fast, irreversible loss of the thrum morph from the population was predicted, even if high inbreeding depression was assumed. To prevent the breakdown of the normal breeding system of the species, morph frequency monitoring for timely active management should be implemented. Active management should include hand pollinations and pollinator therapy - reintroduction and reestablishment of suitable pollinator populations. The method we adopted in this study to parametrize pollinator availability can be used widely in conservation modeling for a range of plant species that have multiple mating types with different degrees of self-incompatibility.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667684

I used the prediction equation of quantitative genetics, R = h2S, to predict the rate at which a change Pollinator abundance may have caused divergence in floral morphology of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. A selection experiment determined the rate at which such divergence can actually proceed. Corolla flare in this species increases by 12% from populations pollinated by a wide assemblage of insect visitors to those pollinated only by bumblebees. To simulate the evolutionary process giving rise to this change, I used a pollinator selection experiment Plants with broad flowers set significantly more seeds than plants with narrow flowers under bumblebee Pollination but had equivalent fecundity when visited by other insects or hand-pollinated. Bumblebee-mediated selection for broad corolla flare intensified from 0.07 at seed set to 0.17 at progeny establishment. Maternal parent-offspring regression yielded a confidence interval of 0.22-1.00 for trait heritability. Given these parameter estimates, the prediction equation shows that broadly flared flowers of bumblebee-pollinated P. viscosum could have evolved from narrower ones in a single generation. This prediction is matched by an observed 9% increase in offspring corolla flare after a single bout of bumblebee-mediated selection, relative to offspring of unselected controls.

The existence of closely related species in the same habitat provides a particularly useful opportunity to examine this issue. A variety of floral traits likely to be associated with the reproductive system of three sympatric Vaccinium species (V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, and V. uliginosum) were quantified in a heathland in the Upper Ardennes, Belgium. These traits included the length and width of the corolla, the number and size of the anthers, the number of pollen tetrads and ovules, and the length of the style. Pollen to ovule ratios suggest a mixed mating system in the three species. The greater pollen to ovule ratio and stigma-anther separation in V. vitis-idaea suggest that it functions more as an outcrosser than the two congeners. The effects of caging, emasculation, and artificial pollination on fruit and seed set differed among years and among the three species. Supplementary pollination increased fruit set and fruit characteristics (particularly seed number) relative to natural pollination in the three species. The three species showed a varied but poor capacity to self in the absence of pollinators. Seed set per fruit was lower in the spontaneously selfed flowers in comparison with hand-crossed pollinated flowers in V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea but not in V. uliginosum. This higher ability to self in V. uliginosum indicates a lower capacity to self in the absence of pollinators. However, all the three species were at least partially self-compatible. Together the floral traits and selfing ability suggest that the polyploid V. uliginosum appears to be more highly selfing than the two diploids, particularly V. vitis-idaea.",Floral biology; Mating system; Mixed mating; Seed set; Vaccinium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666844

Provided that there are no inherent fitness differences among morphs, frequency-dependent selection should result in equal morph frequencies at equilibrium. Stochastic models indicate that the short-styled morph has the highest and the long-styled morph the lowest probability of being lost from local populations as a result of random processes. We surveyed the morph composition of 82 populations of the tristylous, self-incompatible herb Lythrum salicaria in two archipelagos, one in central and one in northern Sweden, located close to the range-margin of the species. To examine whether deviations from even morph frequencies can be explained by among-morph differences in reproductive success, we quantified flower and seed production in six and three populations in the northern and southern archipelago, respectively, and we recorded segregation ratios in offspring produced in six trimorphic populations in the northern area. Seed germination and offspring growth were studied in the greenhouse. Ninety percent of the populations in the southern archipelago (N = 31) and 69% of the populations in the northern archipelago (N = 35) were trimorphic; the remaining populations were dimorphic (only populations consisting of at least three flowering plants considered). Dimorphic populations were smaller than trimorphic populations, as predicted by stochastic models. There was a striking difference in the morph composition of L. salicaria populations between the two archipelagos. In the southern archipelago, there was a slight excess of the long-styled morph and a corresponding deficiency of the short-styled morph. In contrast, the northern populates were characterized by a marked deficiency of the mid-styled morph: the average frequency of the mid-styled morph in trimorphic populations was 0.21, and nine of eleven dimorphic populations lacked the mid-styled morph. In both archipelagos, the long-styled morph (the most common morph) produced about 20% fewer seeds per fruit than the other morphs. The long-styled morph also tended to produce fewer seeds per plant. A hand-pollination experiment performed in two of the northern populations indicated that seed production per flower was pollen-limited in the long-styled morph but not in the other two morphs. Seed germination and offspring size after 24 weeks of growth did not differ among morphs. The mid-styled morph tended to have a higher representation in the offspring than in the parental generation m all six trimorphic populations studied further indicating that the deficiency of the mid-styled morph in the northern archipelago does not represent an equilibrium. Taken together, the results do not support the hypothesis that morph-specific differences in reproductive success can account for deviations from even morph frequencies in L. salicaria.

In 1992, a year with naturally high levels of disease, split husks significantly increased disease severity among the resistant hybrids, but did not affect the susceptible hybrids. Acephate applied to ears with split husks reduced ear rot among all hybrids. Grain yields were significantly less in ears with split husks for all hybrids in 1990 and 1991, and for the resistant hybrids in 1992. Grain yields were higher for all insecticide-treated hybrids each year. These results demonstrate that susceptibility to Fusarium ear rot is influenced by both husk morphology and intra-ear thrips infestation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030049506

From the northern end of the species range, we compare a predominantly selfing population (t? = 0.26) with a more outcrossed population (t? = 0.84), which is genetically similar. From the southern end of the range, we compare a highly selfing population (t? = 0.03) with a more outcrossed population (t? = 0.58). We measured developmental stability in the populations using two measures of within-plant variation in leaf length as well as calculations of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for several leaf traits. Growth-chamber experiments show that selfing populations are significantly more variable in leaf length than more outcrossed populations. Developmental instability can contribute to this difference in population-level variance. Plants from more homozygous populations tend to have greater within:plant variance over developmentally comparable nodes than plants from more heterozygous populations, but the difference is not significant. At the upper nodes of the plant, mature leaf length declines steadily with plant age, allowing for a regression of leaf length on node. On average, the plants from more homozygous populations showed higher variance about the regression (MSE) and lower R2 values, suggesting that the decline in leaf length with plant age is less stable in plants from selfing populations than in plants from outcrossing populations. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was calculated for four traits within single leaves at up to five nodes per plant. At the early nodes of the plant where leaf arrangement is opposite, FA was as calculated for the same traits between opposite leaves at a node. Fluctuating asymmetry is significantly greater in the southern selfing population than in the neighboring outcrossed population. Northern populations do not differ in FA. Fluctuating asymmetry can vary significantly between nodes. The FA values of different leaf traits were not correlated. We show that developmental stability can be measured in plants using FA and within-plant variance. Our data suggest that large differences in breeding system are associated with differences in stability, with more inbred populations being the least stable.",Clarkia tembloriensis; Developmental stability; Evolution of self-pollination; Fluctuating asymmetry; Leaf development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030038923

Interspecific hybridization rarely is considered among the biotic interactions that promote extinction. We show how hybridization may contribute to the demise of rare plant species through demographic swamping and genetic assimilation by an abundant congener. We contend that the growth of the hybrid subpopulation is the key to rare species assimilation, and we show how the production of hybrid seed, the fitness of hybrids, and pest pressure affect hybrid proliferation. We also discuss how habitat disturbance, unspecialized pollinators, and weak crossing barriers promote hybridization, and how the negative consequences of hybridization are unlikely to be compensated for by immigration from conspecific populations.

Analysis of a large number of transgenic events, and their progeny after self-pollination, shows that laurate can accumulate to nearly 60% of the triglyceride acyl groups. Up to 40 mol% laurate the phenotype is correlated positively with the number of thioesterase gene copies. The use of a tandem gene construct elevates the average laurate content. This effect correlates with an increased average number of T-DNA insertions per event; no cis-inactivation of tandem genes is apparent. Above 40 mol% laurate other factors apparently limit the phenotype. The expression timing conferred by the napin promoter is unlikely to be limiting, as it covers almost the entire period of oil deposition. A more significant limitation resides in the second acylation reaction of oil biosynthesis, as shown by the very low incorporation of laurate at the sn-2 acyl group.

We studied geographical differences in the level of early inbreeding depression of Scots pine in a common garden experiment. The mean abortion rate of experimentally self-pollinated seeds was significantly lower (75.4%) among trees that originated from northern populations (66-69°N) than among trees from more southern (60-62°N) populations (86.5%). Thus, the number of embryonic lethal equivalents was lower in the northern populations (4.5) than in the southern ones (6.9). The outcrossing rate at the mature seed stage was slightly lower in the northern populations (average 0.93) than in the southern one (0.99). The estimated selfing rate at the zygote stage varied from 0-0.28 in the populations. The reduction in the magnitude of inbreeding depression in the north may have been caused by increased levels of self-fertilization in the northern populations. The proportion of self-fertilized seedlings and adults was very small in all populations (F ? 0), indicating high inbreeding depression also in later life stages.

When seed set per fruit is not pollen limited, the fate of pollen from later cohorts is affected by the time between pollinator visits, variation in pollen tube growth rates, and the amounts of pollen deposited relative to the availability of stigmatic area and unfertilized ovules. In a natural population of Hibiscus moscheutos, we found that consecutive pollinator visits to individual flowers occurred within 15 min of each other in more than half of our observations. We then conducted hand-pollination experiments using equal doses of early and late pollen bearing unique allozyme markers for paternity analysis (each dose was more than sufficient to result in full seed set). When pollen was applied 15 or 30 min after an earlier pollen load, the proportions of seeds sired by late-arriving pollen were reduced by 13-30% and 21-57%, respectively. A few pollen-tubes from the late pollen load sired seeds even when a large dose of pollen was applied 1-2 h earlier, suggesting that the performance of pollen grains within each cohort was highly variable. The advantage of arriving early was greater when the first pollen load was applied at 0930 hours as compared with 1130 hours. We found no effect of previous pollination on the growth rates of late-arriving pollen-tubes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that pollen from later visits can compete with pollen from earlier visits, but the success of late-arriving pollen typically declines to very low levels after an interval of about 2 h. Given that ""surplus"" pollen often arrives on stigmas by mid-morning, we conclude that male reproductive success is more likely to be affected by the timing of pollen dispersal and pollen-tube competitive ability than by the total amount of pollen that is exported from flowers.",Hibiscus moscheutos; Male reproductive success; Pollen-tube competition; Sequential pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666848

We examined whether such motion affected interactions between ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) and jewelweed (Impatiens capensis) by increasing pollen deposition and by altering the effectiveness of nectar removal. For I. capensis, flower mobility enhanced pollen deposition: birds had significantly longer contact with anthers and more pollen deposited on their bills and crowns when foraging at mobile flowers than at flowers that had been experimentally immobilized. In contrast, flower mobility imposed a cost on hummingbirds by significantly increasing their handling times and reducing their extraction rates relative to their interactions with immobile flowers. Field observations indicated that the motion observed during hummingbird visits did not occur when bees (Bombus spp., Apis mellifera) visited I. capensis flowers, which suggests that the mobility of I. capensis flowers is an adaptation for hummingbird pollination.",Archilochus colubris; Flower morphology; Hummingbird; Impatiens capensis; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750764

We show that Agalinis neoscotica has evolved a novel set of developmental and morphological characters in the flower that assure self-pollination without sacrificing the opportunity for outcrossing. Pollinator exclusion, emasculation tests, and controlled self- and cross-pollinations conducted at three field sites indicate that A. neoscotica is self-compatible. An overall mean pollen-ovule ratio of 128.5 for four populations indicates facultative selfing and indicates that self-fertilization occurred. An estimation of the mating system, using two enzyme loci in each of two natural populations, verifies that selfing occurs in each population, but neither population is completely selfing. Seeds of A. neoscotica are produced by a mix of self-fertilization and cross-fertilization. Observations of buds and flowers of A. neoscotica show that this species differs from its close relatives by precocious self-pollination in bud, thus assuring reproduction in the absence of pollinators, and in three characteristics that provide an opportunity for outcrossing: delayed germination of self pollen, presentation of additional stigmatic area, and lengthened period of anthesis. These results indicate that examination of preanthesis buds and flowers throughout anthesis is necessary for understanding the modes of selfing involved in mixed mating systems.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030429036

With both clones, PI had a positive effect on fruit set, with the maximum rate requiring more than 150 pollen grains per pod. One-half of the maximum rate of fruit set was reached with 39 pollen grains per pod for SCA6, and 78 for IFC5. With SCA6, a significant positive effect of PI on seed number per pod was also observed, with maximum seed number requiring more than 200 pollen grains per pod. In contrast, seed numbers with IFC5 were approximately equal over the PI range 100-800 pollen grains per pod. Patterns of seed number per pod were compared after: (1) open insect pollination, (2) low-intensity hand pollination and (3) high-intensity hand pollination. The patterns obtained with IFC5 under open pollination showed a peak of 40-50 seeds per pod, whereas the distribution patterns were more even with SCA6. The pattern of seed number under open pollination was similar to that obtained with high- intensity hand pollination for IFC5, and with low-intensity hand pollination for SCA6. We concluded that the high number of seeds per pod observed with IFC5 under natural insect pollination may be explained by a high number of compatible self-pollen grains on the stigma and by a severe drop of low- pollinated flowers eliminating potential low-filled fruits. With SCA6, however, the number of compatible pollen grains deposited on the stigma was probably low under open pollination, and the flowers required lower pollen quantities to set fruit, which resulted in a high frequency of low seed numbers per fruit. This difference in the capacity to set low- seeded fruits might be considered as an adaptive trait related to the mode of reproduction.",Fruit set; Pollination intensity; Seed set; Self- compatibility; Theobroma cacao,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029741611

Finally, flowers were (treatment 6) open-pollinated with a supply of extra pollen of distant origin. To investigate pollen or resource limitations to fruit and seed production, V. vitis-idaea was subjected to partial flower removal followed by open- and hand-pollination. Fruit and seed set were estimated for each treatment. The main conclusion is that natural levels of outcrossing are sufficiently high for full seed production and that the availability of pollen is not limiting in natural habitats. There were significant reductions in fruit and seed set after self-pollination in V. myrtillus. Fruit set was reduced in V. vitis-idaea, and V. uliginosum failed to set fruit after self- pollination. Self-pollination caused a decreased seed set in A. polifolia. There was no significant variation across treatments in V. oxycoccos.

The objective of this research was to investigate the relative influence of seed and pollen parents and temperature during pollination on individual seed weight and number of seeds per pod. The relative influence of seed position in the pod on seed weight was also investigated. Twelve diverse clones were designated as seed (4) and pollen (8) parents. They were grown in the greenhouse at 24/18 day/night temperature and then transferred to growth chambers which were maintained at either 18 or 27°C during and 24 h after pollination. Seed weight and number of seeds per pod were influenced by temperature during pollination, and also by both seed and pollen parents. The position of the seed in the pod influenced seed weight. The largest seed occurred at the base of the pod, which may have resulted from a differential nutrient supply from the base to the top of the pod. The number of seeds per pod was greatest at 27°C. This was attributed to enhanced pollen fertility and fertilization success at the higher temperature. Both seed and pollen parents influenced seed weight and number of seeds per pod, and there were significant seed x pollen parent interactions for both traits. Environmental influence and pod position effects on seed weight and number of seeds per pod were small when compared with genetic effects.

The likelihood of pollinator limitation of seed production should therefore increase with decreasing population size. I documented the number of flowering plants and plant fecundity in 18 populations of the self-incompatible, tristylous herb Lythrum salicaria within an archipelago in northern Sweden in two consecutive years. To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation between population size and seed set is due to a higher degree of pollinator limitation in small than in large populations, I performed supplemental hand-pollinations in eight (1993) and 13 (1994) of the study populations. To test the hypothesis that common mating types are more likely than rare types to experience inadequate pollination, I compared the natural level of seed production and the effect of supplemental pollination in different style morphs in the five populations in which ? 10 plants per morph were included in the experiment. There was no significant correlation between population size and plant size in terms of number of floral shoots or number of flower-producing leaf nodes per shoot. However, there was a positive relationship between population size and seed production per flower and between population size and total seed number per plant. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between population size and seed production of flowers that had received supplemental pollination. In both years, the difference in mean seed production per flower between hand-pollinated flowers and controls decreased with increasing population size. In two of five populations, the effect of supplemental pollination differed significantly among morphs. Seed production was more likely to be pollinator limited in long-styled than in short-styled plants, but this difference could not be attributed to a preponderance of the long-styled morph in the studied populations. Results of the supplemental hand-pollinations indicate that the positive correlation between population size and seed production is a function of insufficient pollen transfer in small populations. Additional demographic studies are needed to determine to what extent the reduced level of seed production in small populations limits the growth of young populations, and to what extent it may threaten the local persistence of L. salicaria.",Lythrum salicaria; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pollinator limitation; Population size; Seed production; Self-incompatibility; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030427795

In highly seasonal habitats, however, the time available for flowering may be highly constrained, and many species often flower together. Under such conditions, one alternative to temporal partitioning on a seasonal scale is for species to flower simultaneously, but with pollen release (dehiscence) structured on a diurnal timescale. Here we provide evidence for such diurnal partitioning of both floral resources and pollinator visitation in an African Acacia community. Temporal separation is enhanced by differences in the rewards offered by Acacia species to their pollinators: species producing nectar as well as pollen receive flower visits from insect groups absent from acacias offering only pollen.

Treatment of the papular surface with isolated pollen coating evokes a rapid and extensive expansion of the outer of the two stigmatic wall layers. This response occurs within 4 h but is restricted to those regions where no callose is formed and where the coating exhibits a characteristic increase in electron opacity. This study establishes that the coating alone is responsible for initiating the expansion of the outer wall, which is considered to be an essential step preceding penetration of the stigma surface by the pollen tube. Vesicle-like inclusions, some staining intensely, occasionally occur in regions of the wall expanded by isolated coating, sometimes fusing to form a subcuticular 'boundary layer'. These structures are not observed under compatible grains in vivo and their presence is regarded as artefactual. However, close examination of the plasma membrane at sites beneath areas of expanded cell wall reveals membrane-bound structures resembling the vesicles being generated by the cytoplasm and moving into the apoplast. These data indicate that signals from the coating initiate the loosening of the wall matrix by stimulating an unusual form of localized secretion which appears to be an essential prerequisite for stigmatic penetration. Isolated pollen coating contaminated with fragments of the grain itself engender a very different response, including the formation of densely-staining vesicles accompanied by extensive accumulations of callose; wall expansion never occurs under these circumstances. Self-pollinations in B. oleracea are frequently accompanied by the synthesis of stigmatic callose, the presence of which has, in the past, been interpreted as forming a structural barrier to incompatible pollen tubes. However, callose elicited both by self-pollinations and coating supplemented by killed grains is independent of protein synthesis and occurs in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. Since both these inhibitors also overcome self-incompatibility (SI) in B. oleracea, these data strongly suggest that callose synthesis is unrelated to the operation of SI, and it is proposed that callose, when formed, is elicited by molecules released from the necrotic pollen protoplast. Interestingly, isolated pollen coating of self- and cross-genotypes does not readily elicit callose. The significance of these changes in the stigmatic wall is discussed in the perspective of current views on pollination and self-incompatibility in Brassica.",Brassica oleracea; Pollen coating; Pollination; Stigmatic responses,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5244269717

We studied an ornithophilous flower assemblage and the hummingbird pollinators in a montane forest in southeastern Brazil. Twenty-three native hummingbird-pollinated plant species in 21 genera and 14 families were observed. Bromeliaceae, Fabaceae, Cesneriaceae, and Lobeliaceae are represented by more than one species within the assemblage. Flower shapes vary from narrow tube to bowl-shape, but tubular flowers prevail. The variety of flower shapes and sizes results in diverse pollen placement on the body parts of hummingbird visitors, although pollen is deposited mostly on the bill. Sugar concentration in nectar averages 22.1%, and nectar volume per flower averages 16.9 ?l. The plant populations bloom for one month to year-round, and their flowering approaches the steady-state pattern. Four flower subsets may be defined within the assemblage, each subset related to the bill size and foraging habits of the most frequent bird visitor. Of the six species of hummingbirds recorded at the study site, four are common and largely resident. The four hummingbirds differ in bill size, body mass, and favoured foraging sites, attributes which reflect their favoured flower subsets. One hermit and one trochiline hummingbird share most of the flower species they use, these two birds being the major pollinators within the flower assemblage.

There were also frequency-independent biases towards blue flowers, probably because blue flowers appeared more conspicuous to bumblebees than yellow flowers, and the degree of preference for blue was greater when flowers had low nectar rewards. Flower-to-flower movements by individual bumblebees between flowers were non-random, were biased to movements within the same flower colour, and were also dependent on morph frequency. The mechanisms governing flower selection in bumblebees are discussed.

Showy, flower-like pseudoflowers caused by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on Arabis holboellii (Brassicaceae) commonly co-occur with flowers of Anemone patens (Ranunculaceae). I evaluated the effects of pseudoflowers and anemone on each other's visitation, and the effect of pseudoflowers on the seed set of anemone. I expected that at low overall ""flower"" densities visitation would be facilitated in patches containing a mixture of these species. At low densities, pseudoflowers or flowers alone may be too rare to attract sufficient visitors, but the addition of the other species could make mixtures more attractive and thus increase visitation rates. At high densities I expected that ""flowers"" in mixtures would compete for pollinators because it is more energy efficient for pollinators to concentrate visits on the most rewarding species. I used artificial arrays to separate the effects of ""flower"" density and relative frequency on visitation. Local density was not a good predictor of the influence of one species on the other. Instead, visitation patterns depended most strongly on the kind of visitor (flies vs. bees). Visitation to A. patens by flies was facilitated by the presence of pseudoflowers at both high and low densities, whereas visitation to pseudoflowers was not significantly influenced by A. patens at either density. Local density affected visitation by bees, but relative frequency did not. In addition to observing visitation, I also quantified the effects of interspecific movement of both pollen and spores on the reproductive success of A. patens. Although the presence of pseudoflowers sometimes facilitates visitation to A. patens, this effect could be counterbalanced by competition through interspecific insect movement: sticky pseudoflowers remove pollen from visiting insects, and fungal spermatia deposited on flower stigmas reduce seed set.",Anemone patens; Arabis holboellii; Competition; Facilitation; Floral mimicry; Fly pollination; Halictid bees; Puccinia monoica; Pulsatilla patens; Rust fungi,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030417132

I examined the role of head and corymb size in pollinator attraction, and whether the positive effect of intact rays (if any) depends on the size of the corymb. Using female fertility as a measure of pollination success, I assessed the performance of stems representing four experimentally produced character combinations: (1) few heads without rays, (2) many heads without rays, (3) few heads with rays, and (4) many heads with rays. The proportion of flowers setting fruit was higher for intact stems (treatments 2, 4) than for stems on which the majority of the heads had been removed (treatments 1, 3), suggesting selection for maximum inflorescence production. By contrast, experimental removal of all rays had a relatively weak negative effect on fruit set, with few-headed stems (treatment 1) experiencing a greater reduction than stems with many heads (treatment 2). These results suggest that clusters of heads produce a synergistic effect on pollinator attraction, allowing plants to maintain high visitation rates even if there are drastic reductions in the basic attraction units. Hence, the number of heads and the attractiveness of the individual heads interacted in their effect on pollination success.

Under reproductive assurance, self- pollination is autonomous and the mating system modifier is selected as it allows seed production when pollinators are scarce. We present phenotypic selection models that examine the selection of floral traits influencing several modes of selling simultaneously. Inferences from these models suggest that reproductive assurance may be more important than has been appreciated.

The degree of this selectivity should increase as resources become more constrained and fruit abortion rates increase. One way in which resources could become more constrained is through defoliation by herbivores. The effect of defoliation on selective fruit abortion was tested by examining fruit set and pollen tube numbers in naturally pollinated flowers on defoliated and control branches of Lindera benzoin. Defoliating branches after fruit initiation significantly increased subsequent fruit abortion. Flowers that matured fruit had significantly more pollen tubes per style than those that initiated but then aborted fruit, but greater levels of pollen competition did not result in the production of larger seeds. On undefoliated control branches, selective abortion occurred only among flowers opening during the second half of the flowering season. On defoliated branches selective abortion occurred throughout the entire flowering season. Although defoliation increased abortion rate, it did not increase selectivity based on pollen tube number. When resources were depleted at the branch level, the position of the flower along the branch influenced whether a flower matured a fruit. Floral phenology was unrelated to position.

The pollen in the air was captured on horizontally and veritically placed microscopical glasses in different areas of the seed orchard. After the pollination period, ovules were isolated from the fermale strobili in order to find out the percentage of the pollinated ovules and number of the pollen grains per collecting apparatus. Approximately 140 pollen grains per square centimeter on average were captured on the vertically placed microscopical glasses in 1991. up to 400 in 1992, and only 40 in 1993. The most rapid course of the pollination was observed in 1991. Most pollen grains (in some cases more than 2,000 per square centimeter) were intercepted on the 5th and 7th day of observation and in next days the numbers of captured pollen were significantly lower. In 1992 the pollination period was much longer and more harmonious. This fact is probably associated with stable temperatures and small amount of precipitation (unlike to 1991). When comparing the number of pollen grains on horizontally placed microscopical glasses, approximately 25 pollen grains on average were captured in 1992, 6 in 1991, and only 2 per square centimeter in 1993.

Almost all of analyzed ovules were pollinated in 1992 and up to 27 pollen grains were found on their pollen collecting apparatus in some extreme cases. In 1991 the situation was similar to 1992 (more than 85% ovules pollinated), but in 1993 only 40-85% ovules were pollinated (depending upon the grafted plants and different parts of the crowns) and only 1-3 pollel grains were found in the majority of pollinated ovules.",Larch; Pollen; Pollination; Seed orchard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030501820

Secreted pollination drops persist within spaces surrounding the micropylar opening in closed seed cones. Saccate pollen floats into the micropyle within the pollination drop. Pollination drops become voluminous enough, within the enclosed spaces, to scavenge pollen adhering to the micropylar arms and other surfaces in proximity with the micropyle. Scavenging of pollen from cone surfaces adjacent to the integuments is sometimes facilitated by rainwater that can float pollen into the opening of the micropyle before cone closure and pollination drop secretion. In practice, periodic, light misting of seed orchard trees during seed cone receptivity might increase pollination efficiency by mimicking rainwater involvement in the pollination mechanism. Rainwater involvement in pollination of some modern conifers may reflect a similar situation in the pollination mechanisms of ancestral conifers. Environments with limited rainfall combined with the requirement for moisture in the pollination mechanism may have provided the selective pressure for evolution of the pollination drop.",Conifer; Picea; Pollination drop; Sacci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666849

While this technique is useful for generating inbred lines of self-incompatible species, examining the effects of close inbreeding by producing selfed seeds from bud pollinations may potentially be confounded by the consequences of fertilizing immature ovules. We examined this issue in three species of self-incompatible mustards: Lesquerella fendleri, Brassica rapa, and Raphanus sativus. We performed three types of pollinations on five maternal plants of each species: bud self, bud outcross, and mature flower outcross. For Raphanus, we also planted the seeds produced by these crosses and compared their germination percentages and dry mass 6 weeks after planting. In all three species, outcrossed flowers produced significantly more seeds per fruit than either selfed or outcrossed buds. In each species there were no significant differences among the three crosses in mean individual seed mass per fruit. In Raphanus, the dry mass of plants grown from the selfed bud seeds was marginally less (p = 0.079) than that from seeds from the two outcrosses.

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ""pollination syndromes."" But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ""phenotype space,"" there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ""correct"" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.",Behavior; Behavioral constraints of pollinators; Evolution; Foraging theory; Generalization in pollination systems; Interaction-web connectance; Mutualism; Plant-animal interaction; Pollination syndromes; Solitary bees; Specialization; Surveys of local floras,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030422502

Long distance attraction is probably by a urine- like odour (attraction to mammalian excretions had hitherto been little reported) and colour contrast. Close range lure is by the glittering staminode (probably mimicking droplets by honeydew/moisture) centered by a slippery wart (faking a perch) at which pollinators fly, immediately losing their grip and tumbling into the pouch, preventing wing action and falling being disrupted by a trough-shaped frame. Escape is up the tunnel, past the stigma, to the exit where, pressed by several mechanisms against the anther, the hoverfly scoops off very sticky pollen which has a viability of at least 8 weeks.

We have investigated the temporal and spatial expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase transcripts in petunia styles in an attempt to elucidate its role in increased ethylene biosynthesis following pollination. Previously, we reported that the development of petunia flowers was associated with increased ACC oxidase mRNA localized specifically in the stigmatic regions of the style (X. Tang, A.M.T. Gomes, A. Bhatia, W.R. Woodson [1994] Plant Cell 6: 1227-1239). The rapid increase in ethylene production by styles within the 1st h following pollination was correlated with the expression of ACC oxidase mRNAs during development. Pollination of petunia flowers prior to anthesis and the expression of ACC oxidase mRNA led to a substantial increase in ethylene production, but this was delayed by several hours in comparison with flowers at anthesis. This delayed increase in ethylene production by pollinated styles from immature flowers was associated with an increased ACC oxidase transcript abundance. Treatment with the ethylene action inhibitor 2,5-norbornadiene did not affect the early increase in ethylene production or the expression of ACC oxidase mRNAs. No differences in the rate of pollen germination or tube growth were detected when applied to stigmas from immature or mature flowers, indicating that the delay in ethylene production was likely the result of limited ACC oxidase activity. Localization of ACC oxidase mRNAs following pollination by in situ hybridization revealed an abundance of transcripts in transmitting tract tissue within 4 h of pollination of both immature and mature styles, in contrast to their localization in stigmatic cells during development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030470618

Flowers at anthesis had red anthers, a red stigma and a green corolla which turned red as a postfloral phenomenon. Their flowering period was approximately 10 months long (from mid-June until mid-April) during which time two main flowering patterns were distinguished. Some plants flowered twice a year, with separate summer and winter flowering periods: other plants flowered continously, with two peaks, one in the summer and one in the winter. Several significant differences between summer and winter flowering and fruiting were found: (1) the summer flowering period was shorter than that of winter, (2) flowering synchrony between individual plants was lower in summer than in winter, (3) in summer the plants produced a larger proportion of female flowers, whereas in winter most of the plants produced a larger proportion of hermaphrodites, (4) in summer a limited number of plants produced smaller flowers while the majority produced normal-sized flowers, whereas in winter the entire population produced only normal-sized flowers, and (5) fruit set percentage was lower in summer than in winter. L. acaciae was found to be self-compatible, but, since it was not spontaneously self- pollinated, it showed high dependence on pollinator activity. In summer the flowers were visited by a wide spectrum of pollinators, both birds and insects, while in winter flowers were visited almost exclusively by the orange-tufted sunbird (Nectarinia osea osea, Nectariniidae). These seasonal changes in flowering characteristics and pollinator activity could explain why reproductive success is higher in winter than in summer.",Gynomonoecious; Loranthus acaciae; Male sterility; Nectarinia osea osea; Self-compatible,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-10544243788

As it turns out, the conclusions are quite different depending on whether pollinators or plants are assumed in relative scarcity. In the first case, the two monomorphic states (where all flowers either provide reward, or they do not) are both evolutionarily stable. In the second, there is instead a unique evolutionarily stable state, which is monomorphic or not depending on the rate of flower turnover. These conclusions appear well consistent with reported empirical evidence.

However, it is severely affected by sap sucking insects, the viruses they vector, and cucurbit fruit flies throughout West Africa. Our study was conducted in Senegal to evaluate spunbonded row cover as an integrated production tool with special reference to pest management and pollination. We used an andromonoccious cultivar and compared an open treatment with four cover treatments. In the first two treatments, the covers were removed at the onset of fruiting to allow open pollination. The fabric was laid directly on the plants in one treatment and arranged in small tunnels in the other. In the other two treatments, small tunnels of fabric were maintained over the plants for 20 d alter the onset of fruiting. In one, an end of the tunnel was cut open to allow open pollination while in the last treatment. the tunnel was kept closed and pollination was provided by a colony of African honey bees in a multiple entrance hive. All plants were sprayed with fungicides as needed, but only the plants in the open or those with the cover removed were treated with insecticides. Honey bees foraged in all plots and pollination was not a limiting factor in any of the treatments. Chemical applications alone provided poor protection and yielded an average of 0.18 kg of export- grade fruit per plant. Removal of the covers at the onset of fruiting resulted in severe insect damage and plant losses regardless of the layout of the cover and the final yield of export-grade fruit was 0.40 kg per plant. Tunnels with the opening at one end allowed adequate open pollination while maintaining a significant level of protection from insect pests and gave a yield of 0.56 kg of export grade fruit per plant. The closed tunnels with beehives gave the best results from the standpoint of plant growth and development as well as a yield of export-grade fruit of 0.97 kg per plant.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029862063

(Verbenaceae) consists of two species restricted to southern South America. Rhaphithamnus spinosus (A. L. Juss.) Mold. occurs in mainland Chile and adjacent Argentina; R. venustus (Philippi) Robinson is endemic to the two islands (Masatierra and Masafuera) of the Juan Fernández Archipelago. Both species are related to Citharexylum Miller, a genus distributed from Peru northward along the Andes. Youthful geological ages of the Juan Fernández Islands (1-4 myr) and occurrences of the sister group also on the continent suggest that R. venustus evolved from R. spinosus rather than the reverse. Morphologically the two species differ primarily in corolla length and color and stem armament, with R. spinosus with shorter (ca. 12 mm) and bluish flowers and usually with axillary thorns in contrast to longer (ca. 25 mm) and purple flowers and lack of thorns for R. venustus. Studies of pollinators reveal bees, flies, beetles, and infrequently hummingbirds for R. spinosus and exclusively hummingbirds for R. venustus. Rhaphithamnus spinosus is hermaphroditic and partially self-compatible, whereas R. venustus is gynodioecious and with an unknown compatibility system. In the latter species female flowers appear to be in an early stage of evolution because anthers are still fully formed, but usually without pollen grains. Embryological studies reveal break-down of pollen mother cells (and tapetal cells) during meiosis. We hypothesize that evolution of floral features in R. venustus is a result of a change from primarily insect to hummingbird pollination; loss of thorns may result from absence of herbivores in the Islands. Gynodioecy in Rhaphithamnus may have as its selective basis reduction of inbreeding depression otherwise brought on by geitonogamy in scattered individuals of small populations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030039315

However, the causes of this behaviour are poorly understood since the main limitation in the study of erratic fruit set lies in the difficulty of evaluating all its possible causes in orchard conditions. This results in the eradication of interesting apricot cultivars, such as 'Moniqui', in spite of their increasing commercial demand due to their good organoleptic qualities. In this work the influence of pollination deficit in erratic fruit set is ascertained in orchard conditions and the self-compatibility and intercompatibility relationships among four of the main Spanish apricot cultivars are also studied. While 'Moniqui' is self-incompatible, 'Bulida', 'Canino' and 'Paviot' proved to be self-compatible. Likewise, all the intercrosses between them behave as compatible. An evaluation of both fruit set and pollen tube behaviour in random and supplementary pollinated flowers with pollen from 'Canino' in a commercial orchard of 'Moniqui' shows that fruit set in these conditions is limited by the absence of compatible pollen. This fact, together with the wide range of chilling requirements recorded for these cultivars may lead to poor production due to pollination problems. The situation here recorded might be applicable in other geographical areas and cultivars, since the number of apricot self-incompatible cultivars is gradually increasing. Furthermore, the approach used can also be applied to other situations and species, since it allows the isolation of pollination failure from other possible factors affecting fruit set.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029862064

However, the control inflorescence closest to the hand-pollinated inflorescence showed lower fruit-flower ratio and number of seeds per fruit than both the more distant control inflorescence and the hand-pollinated inflorescence. This observation suggests that resources were shifted from the close control inflorescence to the hand-pollinated inflorescence.

The large volumes of nectar with a high sugar concentration in early flowers indicate that bumblebees neglect or fail to discover early blooming flowers of Bartsia. Early in the season seven bumblebees species visited Bartsia but later on Bombus pascuorum was dominant. This species was also an important visitor of Astragalus. A rather low percentage of the pollen loads contained only Bartsia pollen, 27-28%, during early and peak flowering of Bartsia. Corbicular loads of B. pascuorum, the most frequent visitor of Bartsia, often contained Bartsia but also contained Astragalus pollen and to a lesser extent Ericaceae pollen (probably of Andromeda polifolia). The large variation in composition of corbicular loads indicated that bumblebees were not faithful to Bartsia only and that several plant species were visited by the same individuals. Bumblebee visitation of Bartsia and Pedicularis during a single trip may result in heterospecific pollen deposition which may lower seed set in Bartsia. Bumblebee visitation of Bartsia and Astragalus during a single trip may not result in heterospecific pollen deposition on Bartsia flowers due to the deposition of Bartsia pollen on the dorsal and Astragalus pollen on the ventral side of the body of bumblebees. Low seed set of early blooming flowers of B. alpina was probably due to low visitation rates by bumblebees. In addition, seed set of early flowers may be low due to heterospecific pollen depositions but this also may occur later in the season if the composition of corbicular loads is considered. After artificial heterospecific pollinations seed set decreased as compared with pure pollinations.",Bartsia alpina; bumblebees; nectar; phenology; pollen load; seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303636

Further tests performed in a limited number of species revealed other kinds of carbohydrate reserves in the cytoplasm but outside plastids. From these observations, it results that carbohydrate reserves may be stored in plastids only (amyloplasts), in the cytoplasm but not in plastids, or in both. These kinds of pollen reserves are only partly in line with systematics, as only certain families consistently show the same type of reserve. These and previous findings suggest that the presence of polysaccharides in the cytoplasm prevents rapid decrease in viability due to desiccation.

Monoecy may have been favored as a means of assuring pollination via selfing: the proportion of ovules pollinated was positively correlated with the number of male cones on a plant. Selfing may be at the cost of inbreeding depression; 26% of the female cones aborted, about twice the percentage of the dioecious Taxus cuspidata. Application of nutrient fertilizer did not reduce the abortion percentage. Seed and aril maturation in T. canadensis occurred over a three month period, much more gradually than in T. cuspidata. Removal of the seeds, probably by antagonistic rodents, was very rapid and thorough in T. canadensis.

Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is assumed to be highly self-pollinated, an assumption that has not been verified for more recent western Canadian spring wheat cultivars. This field study was designed to estimate the outcrossing (OC) rate in three market classes of spring wheat in each of 2 yr and to determine whether OC rates were associated with specific spike characteristics. Highest OC rates were detected for the cultivar Oslo (6.05%) followed by Rongotea (2.30%), Roblin (1.43%), Wildcat (1.35%). Bigger (1.05%) and Glenlea (0.95%). In contrast, Katepwa and CDC Makwa had OC rates of 0.38 and 0.30%, respectively. The cultivars Oslo, Columbus, Roblin and Glenlea tended to have lower iodine pollen viabilities. Of those four cultivars, three had higher-than-average OC rates. No single spike characteristic was correlated with OC rate. However, the cultivars Oslo, Wildcat and Glenlea had high OC rates, low pollen staining and spikes which tapered at the extremeties. Furthermore, cultivars with higher OC rates tended to have a greater degree of spikelet opening at anthesis. The high levels of OC observed in this study could result in obvious off-types if morphologically diverse cultivars were grown in adjacent pedigreed seed fields. The current 3 to 10 m isolation distance for pedigreed wheat seed production may not be enough to ensure that OC is minimized.",Cross-pollination; market class; spring wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029827961

The percentage of damaged flowers averaged 64% and was as high as 81 % in one study site. Pollen is placed on the front of the bird's head by the exserted stamens with large versatile anthers. This pollination syndrome is unique for the bird involved and exceptional in the kind of reward offered.

In previous studies with the montane plant Ipomopsis aggregata, we documented pollinator-mediated selection on several aspects of floral form, including flower width. This character varies continuously within natural populations of I. aggregata, and individuals with wider flowers export more pollen per flower to surrounding plants. We previously showed that this component of phenotypic selection is due primarily to the pervisit effectiveness of hummingbirds, the most important pollinator in our study populations. Here we investigate mechanisms of differential visit effectiveness in greater detail. First, counts of pollen in unvisited flowers showed that pollen production itself increases with width. In aviary experiments, hummingbirds also removed a greater proportion of available pollen as width increased. We next videotaped visits to flowers that varied in width either naturally, or by experimental treatment, and found that hummingbirds inserted their bills more deeply into wider flowers. Finally, we directly manipulated how deeply birds could insert their bills, and found that more pollen was removed after deep insertion. Thus, several mechanisms appear to underlie selection on corolla width via visit effectiveness in pollen export. One involves a phenotypic correlation with pollen production; this underscores the value of experiments for untangling indirect from direct selection. Another mechanism involves direct selection due to the depth of insertion of a hummingbird's bill; this is rare evidence for one form of selection involving the ""fit"" between pollinator and flower.",Flower shape and size; Hummingbird; Ipomopsis; Morphology; Phenotypic correlation; Pollen export and production; Pollinator effectiveness; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030440772

Honey bee activity was recorded also on inflorescences of naturally growing plants in which the secretion of nectar was measured and the anther dehiscence recorded. Honey bees were the only common pollinators observed on sumac in the study area.

Female inflorescences secreted great amounts of nectar during the afternoon, but in male inflorescences there was little secretion. Honey bees seemed to forage according to the circadian availability of resources. Most of their activity concentrated on male inflorescences in the morning and on female ones during the afternoon. Both the occurrence of bees with pollen loads in their corbiculae and the length of the visits to each sex also seemed to be in accordance to the kind of resource exploited at particular times of the day.

Additionally hand-pollination (self- and cross-pollination) has been performed in the greenhouse.

Apis mellifera Anthidium sp., Andrena, sp. and Lysandra sp. have been captured visiting the flowers of E. andevalensis. Mean number of ovules per flower was high, ca. 77, and was statistically independent of population, individual plant and inflorescence. The mean average fertility (74%) also varied at these three levels. Fruit and seed set in natural populations were high, with values ca 87% for fruiting; in the field the mean number of seeds per fruit was close to 57. The exclusion of insects (i.e. pollinators) in the field lowered very signigicantly fruit- and seed-set, while in the greenhouse absolutely no fruit or seed has occurred spontaneously. Hand-pollination experiments produced significantly lower rates of seeds/fruit compared to plants in the field, but there was no effect of cross- versus self-pollination. Erica andevalensis is therefore a self-compatible not-selfing species. From a conservation point of view, this species is in a ""good reproductive health"", it produces high numbers of fruit and seed set under natural conditions. Therefore, no intrinsic reproductive threat is apparent.

Selection for functional independence among traits, however, can reduce these correlations over evolutionary time. In 1960, R.L. Berg hypothesized that the sizes of flowers in insect-pollinated plants should be selected to remain constant regardless of the size of vegetative structures, so that flowers match the sizes of their pollinators for effective pollination. This hypothesis of functional independence of floral sizes from the size of the rest of the plant predicts that correlations between floral and vegetative traits should be reduced relative to correlations within trait groups. We measured correlations in five species of insect-pollinated plants, including four Brassicaceae and Phlox divaricata. Our results support the hypothesis.

Panicled bluebells (Mertensia paniculata) experience high rates of nectar robbery by bumble bees (Bombus mixtus and B. frigidus) in the Wrangell Mountains of southcentral Alaska. Nevertheless, experimental prevention of nectar larceny in two seasons did not enhance components of female reproductive success (nutlet initiation, seed-set, and seed mass) or male success (pollen removal). Observational data show that the absence of a negative impact of nectar robbery is a consequence of bumble bee behaviors; the two bee species that rob mature flowers buzz-pollinate the same flowers at an earlier stage in floral development. The shift in bee behavior is driven by the presentation of different rewards at different times in the flowering period; young flowers contain pollen and older flowers produce nectar. Although flowers typically receive and donate pollen before most nectar is produced, the mature flowers producing a robbed nectar reward may nonetheless contribute to the reproductive success of bluebell plants. Flowers sequestered from pollinators in the early stage were still capable of initiating nutlets, demonstrating that older flowers can enhance female reproduction if pollinators are rare (when many early-stage flowers may go unvisited). Moreover, the removal of mature flowers reduced the visitation rate to early-stage flowers on the same plant. Because individual bumble bees switch frequently between nectar robbing and pollen collection, the nectar reward in mature flowers may act as a key enticement to pollinators, which then enhance plant reproduction by legitimately visiting early-stage flowers.

The study focused on the insects' role as potential pollinators and the effect of bumblebee flight and foraging activity on plant reproductive success. The activity rates of both bumblebees and butterflies were significantly correlated with ambient air temperature and solar radiation, and as a consequence, both bumblebees and butterflies exhibited a regular diurnal activity pattern. The butterflies' activity was more constrained by low temperature and solar radiation then the bumblebees' activity, and small worker bees were more affected by the weather than the larger queens. Only 1% of the butterflies observed were visiting flowers, as compared to 69% of the bumblebees. Thus, butterflies seem to be less important pollinators for the alpine plant community than bumblebees. Short- term micrometeorological impact on the reproduction of two bumblebee pollinated plant species, Bartsia alpina and Diapensia lapponica, was also studied. In both species, reproductive success, measured as seed production, was significantly reduced during a spell of cold weather in comparison to a warmer period.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029660144

Multiple GA3 sprays at different stages during bloom increased fruit set and yield in field experiments in Florida and in grower trials in Georgia. However, GA3-treated fruit were smaller and matured later than untreated fruit. Similarly, GA3 application to non-pollinated flowers under controlled environmental conditions increased percent fruit set, decreased average fruit weight, and increased fruit development period when compared to hand-pollinated fruit. High night temperature (21 °C) reduced fruit set and average fruit weight compared to 10°C night temperature for both GA3-treated and hand-pollinated fruit. Overall, results indicate that use of GA3 under conditions of low natural fruit set in the field may significantly increase yield, although much of the yield increase would be comprised of later maturing, smaller fruit. © 1995 by The Haworth Press, Inc.",Fruit set; GA3; Pollination; Vaccinium ashei,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009817759

Plants that produced many cones had greater shoot growth; no obvious tradeoff between sexual effort and vegetative growth was observed. T. canadensis is monoecious, but plants showed considerable variation in phenotypic gender. Because related species are dioecious, we hypothesize that T. canadensis evolved from a dioecious ancestor. Monoecy may have been favored as a means of assuring pollination via selfing; the proportion of ovules ollinated was positively correlated with the number of male cones of a plant. Selfing may be at the cost of inbreeding depression: 26% of the female cones aborted, about twice the percentage of the dioecious Taxus cuspidata. Application of nutrient fertilizer did not reduce the abortion percentage. Seed and aril maturation in T. canadensis occurred over a three month period, much more gradually than in T. cuspidata. Removal of the seeds, probably by antagonistic rodents, was very rapid and thorough in T. canadensis. Asynchronous ripening and monoecy may help reduce seed predation by rodents by reducing the conspicuousness of 'fruiting' displays relative to the dioecious species.",monoecy; phenotypic gender; pollination limitation; reproductive alocation; seed abortion; seed consumption; Taxus canadensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029758806

Fruit growth was modified by the reduction of seed number or by the application of the synthetic phenylurea cytokinin N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea (CPPU). The influence of these treatments on cell division was monitored by flow cytometry and changes in the endogenous cytokinins were measured at days 10 and 20 after anthesis, using highperformance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Total cytokinin levels appeared not to be limiting growth since the highest total cytokinin concentration was detected in unpollinated fruit, which abscised by day 25 after anthesis. However, compared with control fruit which had the highest concentration of zeatin (Z) 10 days post anthesis, Z levels were low in unpollinated fruit. It is hypothesised that an increase in Z is the critical change in cytokinin metabolism required for the initiation of cell division and fruit growth. The synthetic cytokinin CPPU promoted fruit development, but there was a decrease in the endogenous cytokinin concentration. Zeatin was not detected in CPPU-treated fruit. Cell division was reduced in unpollinated fruitlets but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the other treatments.

The species grows on erosion slopes or rocks, and its local populations are often small and isolated. Crossing experiments resulted in better seed-set than selfing, but both yielded viable seeds. Agamospermy did no occur. In an early-successional species like S. mutata, successful selfing is important in the colonization of new habitats. Flowers of S. mutata were visited by Syrphidae and unspecialized Hymenoptera. A germination rate of 40% was reached in cultivation after 20 weeks but germination continued until the end of the experiment after 92 weeks. Seeds stored dry for 30 months at room temperature mostly lost their germinability. In natural habitats, seedlings were found almost throughout the year with a peak in spring. Suitable safe sites were small patches of open soil, bare marl on erosion slopes, and rock crevices. All individuals investigated were diploid with 2n = 26. Allozyme electrophoresis showed a lack of segregation within the populations. Intra- and interpopulation genetic variation was low. These results were in partial disagreement with theoretical expectations in a mixed species. It is concluded that demographic rather than genetic processes are the main cause of extinction of populations of S. mutata, at least in the short-term.",allozymes; conservation biology; genetic variation; germination; pollination - population dynamics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030470330

In this article we show that JV. clavipes spin silks of varying spectral properties in response to both the intensity and spectral composition of its light environment. In bright light characterized by broad irradiance spectra, N. clavipes produce a complex of yellow pigments that absorb light of wavelengths less than 500 nm, making their webs appear golden. In dim light and where wave-lengths less than 500 nm have been eliminated, N. clavipes produce pigments that reflect light between 400 and 500 nm, making their webs appear white. Because yellow serves as a superstimulus attracting both herbivorous and pollinating insects, yellow silks may attract prey to spider webs. By training Trigona fluviventris, a stingless bee commonly fed on by N. clavipes, to forage at an artificial feeding site, we found that silk color affects insect response in two ways. First, yellow webs attract and intercept T. fluviventris more frequently than webs of any other color. Second, even after being intercepted once, T. fluviventris have difficulty learning to avoid yellow webs. We propose that N. clavipes has evolved a foraging behavior that makes use of the color cues insects seek while foraging and that the broad distribution of N. clavipes results from the spiders' ability to adjust the reflectance properties of its silks relative to its local light environment, allowing spiders to make use of whatever local populations of prey are most abundant.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667592

Saplings often occur as dense clusters of half-sibs around the presumed maternal parent, and only four adults were seed parents to a large proportion of the saplings sampled. A stump apparently was the seed parent of the largest cluster of half-sibs, which occupied a sizeable light gap opened up by the death of their maternal tree. Approximately half of the saplings appeared to have grown from seeds that had not been removed after falling from the tree, and half from seeds that were dispersed beyond the crown of their maternal parent. Long-distance seed dispersal may be more common than has been previously reported. Extremely high levels of long-distance pollination were indicated, and pollen donors within the stand were generally distributed randomly around maternal trees.

The embryo did not grow beyond club-shaped stage but genotypic differences in the longevity of the multicellular embryo did exist. Observation of storage starch in the integumentary cells and normal activity of the endothelium in breaking down of a few abutting integumentary cell layers suggests that the endosperm and embryo abortion in E X C crosses was due to genetic lethality and not due to lack of nutrients.

Microscopic studies showed polymorphism within the population of hoary mustard for pollen germination on oilseed rape flowers. The transgenic herbicide-resistant and a commercial cultivar of oilseed rape were not different for pollen behaviour and ovule fertilization. Pollen tube growth was slow and erratic in interspecific crosses. Fertilization efficiency of oilseed rape and hoary mustard pollen in interspecific crosses was 15% and 1.3%, respectively, of that in intraspecific crosses. This unequal efficiency in reciprocal crosses was confirmed by hybrid seed set in pods. There was no post-zygotic barrier to the development of hybrid embryos in hoary mustard pods. Up to 26 spontaneous hybrids per male sterile oilseed rape plant, and one per hoary mustard plant, were obtained in field experiments. Hybrids were identified by isozyme electrophoresis, morphology and cytology. All hybrids were triploid with 26 chromosomes, and had low fertility. They produced 0.5 seeds per plant after spontaneous backcrossing with hoary mustard. Some of these descendants were produced from unreduced gametes. Our results suggest that gene flow is likely to occur, but its actual frequency under crop growing conditions remains to be estimated.",Biosafety; Gene flow; Hoary mustard; Interspecific hybrid; Oilseed rape; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029767438

This discrepancy might be explained by the use of large nectar volumes in all published choice tests to date. Biophysical models predict that low concentrations maximize energy intake rates, and thus may be preferred, at small volumes characteristics of the flowers that birds visit. Rufous hummingbirds', Selasphorus rufus, concentration preferences were tested and their intake rates measured at low volume with a computer-controlled food delivery and activity-monitoring system. Contrary to the predictions of models, birds generally preferred 65% sucrose over more dilute solutions. This preference generated near maximal energy intake rates over the time scale of foraging bouts, even though rates over flower visits and shorter time scales suggested that lower concentrations would be more profitable.

Flowering starts at the end of January or beginning of February and continues till May, when the plant completes its vegetative cycle. Flowers are autogamous: pollination takes place in the corolla tube, which is totally closed by the palate and by the two corolla lips, which spread after pollination is accomplished; fruit development immediatelly follows pollination. Flowers take 3-4 days to develop and wither; fruits take 9-14 days to grow and dehisce. Low P/O ratio, high fruit/flower and seed/ovule ratio, and PERS values close to 1, both in conditions of allogamy and autogamy, indicate that L. tursica is a strictly autogamous species.

The Iris douglasiana - Iris innominata hybrid zone follows an ecotone a few kilometres inland from the ocean, implying different habitat associations for the two species, perhaps because of climate. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed that habitat association plays a major role in isolation. Each species survives best in its own habitat. Additional differences in perianth-tube length and flowering time between the two species have not developed into significant genetic isolating factors. The second hybrid zone occurs where species with different perianth- tube lengths co-occur (Iris chrysophylla - Iris tenax). Crosses between long- and short-tubed species suggest that differences in perianth-tube length can limit gene flow. Gene flow is also limited in the other direction, because the long-tubed species, I. chrysophylla, blooms earlier (though the flowering periods overlap). Coupled with the fact that these irises are all protandrous (anthers mature about 3 days before stigmas). relatively few days will be available when the long-tubed species can pollinate the short-tubed species. This combination of factors is probably a major form of genetic isolation in the I. chysophylla - I. tenax zone.",Habitat association; Phenology; Reciprocal transplant; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030389960

Floral symmetry reliably reflects pollinator rewards of individual plants. Pollinators prefer symmetrical flowers over asymmetrical ones, visit flowers assortatively with respect to symmetry, and avoid flowers with experimentally increased asymmetry. Embryo abortion rates are strongly positively related to floral asymmetry of both pollen donor and recipient, implying that both maternal and paternal plants affect embryo failure.

Selfed and cross-pollinated plants were produced through controlled crosses and were then planted in their native environment. We recorded size at establishment, final height, number of branches, fruits, total biomass, and resistance to herbivores for each plant. Natural selection was measured for plant size and resistance to herbivores in both types of plants. Seed production (fecundity) was higher for fruits developed from outcrossing than for fruits derived from selfing. Among-family differences were detected for seed mass, but these were not related to mating system. No differences in germination, plant size, and fruit number were found between the two mating systems. Damage produced by two herbivores, Epitrix parvula and Sphenarium purpurascens, ranged from 0 to 95% of total leaf area; however, there were no differences in resistance to both herbivorous insects either among families or between mating systems. Plant survival through the whole season was similar for plants of both types of crossing. The direction and magnitude of phenotypic selection for each trait were similar for both types of progeny. Directional selection to increase plant size and reduce resistance to E. parvula was detected, while no selection was detected for resistance to S. purpurascens. Curvilinear (stabilizing/disruptive) and correlational selection modes were not detected for any trait. Inbreeding depression coefficients were all statistically indistinguishable from zero, except for seed number per fruit.

Research Institute, P.O. Box 2072, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Several studies of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in animals show that secondary sexual characters used in signalling have a negative relationship between size and asymmetry. Larger sexual traits are presumably more costly to produce, which should lead to greater developmental stress and corresponding increases in asymmetry. In the absence of among individual variation in the ability to handle these costs, the relationship between size and asymmetry should thus be positive. A negative relationship therefore suggests that expression of these traits is condition-dependent. In plants, flowers act as signals for pollinators and may show similar trends to animal signals. Leaves which are uninvolved in signalling should not. Moller and Eriksson (1994) found that 89% of species (n = 16 of 18) with insect- pollinated flowers showed a negative relationship between petal size and asymmetry, while 79% of species (n = 15 of 19) showed a positive relationship between leaf size and asymmetry. I carried out a similar study of 18 plant species. The average relationship between petal size and asymmetry did not differ significantly from zero in those species showing measurable FA in flowers (n = 12). The relationship was significantly negative in one species, and significantly positive in another. On average, leaves in species with FA did not show a significant positive relationship between size and asymmetry (n = 7). There was no significant difference in the slopes of the relationship between size and asymmetry for leaves and flowers. Levels of floral asymmetry for species with FA were significantly repeatable on individual plants in 33% (n = 4 of 12) of species, but leaf asymmetry was not significantly repeatable in any species.

Plant functional types (PFTs) were defined here as categories into which plants could be grouped on the basis of attributes that predict greater or lesser sensitivity to ecological variability. Plant range size indicates commonness of a species and was assumed to be a proxy for 'ecological flexibility', i.e. species of larger range sizes can better withstand environmental change and differences than species of smaller range sizes. Using evolutionary comparative methods that account for the effect of taxonomic relatedness, both floras were investigated for the effects on range size of woodiness vs. non-woodiness, trees vs. shrubs, trees vs. herbs and shrubs vs. herbs. The British flora was examined additionally for the effects of wind- vs. non-wind-pollination, self vs. animal pollination and animal vs. non-animal fruit dispersal on range size. Two analyses showed significant effects on range size: for British species, trees had larger ranges than shrubs, and wind-pollinated species had larger ranges than non-wind-pollinated species. It is suggested that the lack of a similar pattern for shrubs and trees in Kriti is because the lower water availability of Kriti imbues shrubs with an ecophysiological advantage not relevant in plants of Great Britain. That trees have larger range sizes than shrubs in Great Britain is ascribed to the greater importance of competition for light when other factors are not at issue. The greater range of wind- pollinated than non-wind-pollinated species in Great Britain is postulated to be because both mutualists must be capable of invading new areas. This may be termed a 'cost of mutualism'. In terms of PFTs, the results indicate that 'life-form' is too broad a classification category by which to differentiate relative sensitivity to environmental variability in Great Britain, in that there were significant differences in range size of trees and shrubs, but not between either of the two categories and herbs, or between woody and non- woody plants.

Population multilocus outcrossing rates, individual tree multilocus outcrossing rates, and the correlation of outcrossed paternity were estimated from analysis of allozyme variation in embryonic and megagametophytic tissue of wind-pollinated seeds. All population outcrossing rate estimates were significantly different from t = 1. Positive association between population density and outcrossing rate was detected for one location (0.903 versus 0.876) and inverse association was obtained for the second (0.793 versus 0.912). In three populations, the distributions of individual tree outcrossing rates were skewed toward high outcrossing. In the fourth population, which produced a low multilocus estimate of outcrossing, individual tree outcrossing rates were widely distributed. High and significant correlated matings (6% and 10%) were detected in the populations with high densities, while low (0.1% and 2.0%) estimates were detected in populations with low density. It appears that the effects of population density observed in this study and reported in previous studies can be overridden by the presence of barriers that limit pollen movement.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030474710

The expression of the Cat and Sod genes has been investigated in pollinated, accelerated senescent silks and in unpollinated, normally grown silks during the first 5 days following ear shoot pollination. Because CAT-3 is the predominant catalase form in silks, increased levels of the CAT-3 isozyme protein in pollinated silks, relative to unpollinated silks, appear to be of sufficient magnitude to account for the increased levels of total catalase activity. In contrast, the steady-state levels of the Cat1 and Cat3 mRNAs (Cat2 mRNA is not detected) are steady throughout the developmental period examined, indicating that no obvious transcript accumulation differences are observed between pollinated and unpollinated silks. Taken together, these observations suggest that protein turnover might play a role in the response of the CAT-3 isozyme to accelerated senescence in maize silks. Like the Cat transcripts accumulation, the steady-state levels of the Sod2, Sod3, and Sod4 mRNAs are continuously high and exhibit no significant changes (as is also the case for SOD activity) in pollinated and unpollinated silks.",Catalase; free radicals; senescence; superoxide dismutase; Zea mays silks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029740360

The newer antihistamine cetirizine appears to have a rapid onset of action and a low potential to interfere with posttreatment skin testing results. Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety, and skin test inhibition of astemizole and cetirizine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Methods: In a double-blind, parallel-group study conducted at six sites during ragweed pollination season, 263 subjects were randomized to receive 10 mg of astemizole, 5 mg of cetirizine, or 10 mg of cetirizine daily for 2 weeks. The subjects rated seven allergic rhinitis symptoms daily, the subjects and investigators provided global assessments of the responses to the treatments, and the subjects rated their satisfaction with the treatments. Thirty-nine subjects at one study site underwent quantitative skin testing before and after treatment. Results: As measured by reduction from baseline in total symptom severity score, which was the primary efficacy measure in the study, all three treatments significantly relieved the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (P &lt; .05). This finding was supported by the global ratings and the subject satisfaction ratings. There were no significant differences among the three treatments for reduction from baseline in total symptom severity score. The mean subject satisfaction score with 10 mg of cetirizine was significantly greater than that with astemizole (P &lt; .05). In the skin tests performed 3, 7, and 14 days after the end of antihistamine treatment, the subjects who had received the cetirizine doses had significantly greater mean sum of wheal and mean sum of erythema values than those who had received the astemizole dose (P &lt; .05). Sensitivity to ragweed pollen extract returned to 90% of baseline within three days of the end of cetirizine treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated and their adverse event profiles were similar. Conclusions: Astemizole and cetirizine are effective and well tolerated in alleviating the symptoms of ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis.

Don. Two trials were examined by measuring microfibril angle in alternate growth rings on breast height discs. In the first trial, two sites were compared for 11- year-old trees propagated from seedlings, and cuttings of comparable genotype, at 0 and 5 years physiological age, respectively. In the second trial, a single site was examined comparing 25-year-old trees propagated from open pollinated seedlings, and cuttings physiologically aged by 12 - 16 years, original ng from 10 seed-orchard climes. In each trial there was a significant effect of physiological age for microfibril angle in the first 9 growth rings with a greater effect in the trees of greater physiological age. Physiological aging produced a significant decrease in microfibril angles in the juvenile wood, on average reducing microfibril angle to values below 35°in trees aged by 12-16 years. Juvenile wood size, as indicated by the point at which microfibril angle gradient changes, was reduced by an average of two rings in both sets of aged cuttings examined. There was no effect of site in the material examined. Differences were consistent among seedling/ramet pairs of similar genotype. The use of aged cuttings rather than seedlings should result in increased stiffness of the juvenile wood and reduced longitudinal shrinkage. However, other changes associated with physiological aging, such as reduced basic density and growth rate, may affect the practicality of using highly aged planting stock as part of general forestry practice in New Zealand.",cuttings; juvenile wood; Microfibril angle; physiological aging; Pinus radiata; seedlings; site; wood quality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030449795

The skin of the fruit typically has a bitter taste although the degree of bitterness varies within and among localities. Flavor, anthocyanins and flavonols of fruits are very similar to cranberry. Unlike cranberry, soluble solids conlent can be quite high. Elite genotypes for large fruit size, glaucousness, palatability and resistance to fruit shattering have been identified in Lexington County, SC.

The mutual random mating of the parental components means that the F1 hybrid seed is not produced by the traditional methods (female and male rows with detasselin8 or using male sterile female) but the advantages of the mutual selective fertilisation of maize are utilised, and the inbred lines (and/or basic single crosses) are planted mixed and they are random mated vica versus. The hybrid seed produced in this way will certainly include the self-fertilised grains of the parental components as well to some percentage. On the basis of the trials up to now it seems to be easy to attain 70% (or more) cross-pollination ratio rooting in the preference between the individual genotypes. If this F1 seed, which is mixed with the seed of the self-fertilised parental components, so genetically contaminated, is planted with an increased - at least according to the ratio of contamination - seed quantity, the yield of the commercial maize producing area will be only by 3-8% less (not significant difference) than that of the 100% check according to the results of the small plot trials. This seed production method, which is cheaper and simpler than any other known seed production -methods, could be applied successfully in those developing countries, in which the conditions of the modern large farm maize production and those of modern seed production are not available.",allogamy; genetic contamination; maize; male sterility; plant density increase; preference to foreign pollen; self-incompatibility; sib-crossing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029858244

The families with the largest number of invasive species are: Rosaceae, Mimosaceae, Papilionaceae and Pinaceae.

The highest number of invasive woody species are recorded from Europe, followed by the Pacific islands, North America, New Zealand, Australia, Indian Ocean islands and southern Africa. Included in these regions are areas which have fewer highly invasive species, e.g. islands on continental shelves, such as the British Isles. Although most invasions occur in disturbed habitats, most natural communities are susceptible to woody plant invasions. Data on species attributes are only available for a minority of species but indicate that invasive woody plant species may be either insect or wind-pollinated, have a wide array of fruit types, fruit and seed sizes, number of seeds per fruit and dispersal agents. The relative frequency of several attributes varies with the degree of invasiveness.

In addition, analyses of genetic structure were made based on allozyme variation. The populations in the eastern region of Hokkaido were found to exhibit high genetic variability. Emasculated individuals in these populations produced mature seeds, whereas bagged individuals did not. By contrast, northern and southern populations mostly exhibited very low genetic variability. Based on studies of chromosome variations in natural populations of this plant, it has been predicted that inbreeding is responsible for the low levels of genetic variation observed. However, in breeding experiments, both bagged and emasculated individuals produced mature seeds. Most of the self-compatible and genetically variable populations were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These results suggest that the plants in the eastern populations are self-incompatible and that seed production and high genetic diversity result from predominant outbreeding (insect pollination). By contrast, the northern and southern populations with low genetic diversity potentially exploit a mixed system of outbreeding and inbreeding. ©1996 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Breeding system; Genetic variation; Isozymes population structure; Self-incompatibility; Trillium kamtschaticum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030453983

Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational clines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests.

The number of pollen grains that landed on the stigma was found to have a mode that varied in relation to wind speed direction. At distances beyond that of the peak, this number decreased with increasing distance of pollen dispersal. Under field conditions, the pollen was sparse and isolated on the stigma. In the laboratory, the pollen on the silicone- coated slides adhered both in clumps and as isolated grains. Their number showed a mode which varied in distance in relation to wind speed. At higher speeds, the peak was further from the plants. The number of grains per clump was larger at shorter distances. The wind speed of 0.2 m/s was not sufficient to blow all the pollen grains from the anther. At speeds of 0.5 and 1 m/s the anthers were always completely empty. These results show that Mercurialis annua pollen can be transported in the atmosphere as single grains or in clumps of different numbers held together by pollenkitt.",anemophilous pollination; dioecy; Mercurialis annua; pollenkitt,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030428601

Seedlings subjected to high levels of water stress during the shoot-growth period had the highest needle toughness among all treatments in study 2. In addition, significant differences in needle toughness among open-pollinated families in both studies suggest that needle toughness varies from tree to tree and may in part be genetically regulated. We also found a significant linear relationship between root/shoot ratio and needle toughness and an inverse relationship between needle toughness and total seedling biomass in study 1.

These plants vary greatly in terms of geographic range, population size, pollination ecology, and seed dispersal mechanisms. Ceratiola ericoides (Empetraceae) is a shrub that occurs throughout scrub and other sandy habitats in Florida and neighboring states. In contrast, Eryngium cuneifolium (Apiaceae) is a Federally endangered herbaceous perennial, limited to the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge, site of a proposed National Wildlife Refuge that would be the first designed primarily to protect plant diversity. Four species of endangered woody perennial Dicerandra (Labiatae) are part of a monophyletic group endemic to Florida sand pine scrubs; Dicerandra frutescens and D. christmanii are found on the southern end of the Lake Wales ridge, D. cornutissima is found in north-central Florida, and D. immaculata occurs in a small area along Florida's Atlantic coast. Allozyme electrophoresis of 17 loci for C. ericoides indicated that 64.7% of the loci were polymorphic (Ps), that there were 2.55 alleles per polymorphic locus (APs), and that the mean gene diversity (Hes) was 0.141. The proportion of genetic diversity among the four populations (GST) was 0.059. For the 31 loci analyzed in E. cuneifolium, Ps was 32.3%, APs was 2.1, and Hes was 0.104. GST was 0.106. The woody Dicerandra species complex (four species) was analyzed for 17 loci. Ps was 64.7%, APs was 3.1, and mean gene diversity was 0.219. The mean GST value across the species complex was 0.137. Taken together these results suggest that considerable genetic variation is still present in the relict populations of the rare scrub taxa (Eryngium and Dicerandra), but that to preserve current levels of genetic variation will require protecting areas in each of several different scrub regions along a 350-km stretch of peninsular Florida.",Allozyme; Ceratiola; Dicerandra; Eryngium; Florida; Scrub,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030019255

We present a four-species model of a pollination mutualism embedded in other types of community interactions. Conclusions derived from two-species models about the destabilizing effect of mutualisms are misleading when applied to the present scenario; although the mutualisms are locally destabilizing, the effect is more than canceled by an increased chance of feasibility. The crucial difference is the interaction of the mutualists with other species in a larger web. Furthermore, community persistence (without unrealistic population explosion), arguably a superior ecological criterion, is greatly enhanced by the presence of mutualisms. Therefore, we predict that mutualisms should be common in the real world, a prediction matching empirial findings and in contrast to the predictions from local stability analysis of basic two-species models. This method of stabilizing a mutualism appears superior in some ways to the often-used method of introducing density dependence in the strength of the mutualism, because it permits obligate mutualisms to exist even at low densities, again matching empirical findings. Lastly, this study is an example of how complex model assemblages can behave qualitatively differently from analogous simpler ones.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030474845

The nectary parenchyma stores material for synthesizing the sugar component of nectar and stores similar material again after nectar resorption.

The mean grain yield of hybrids possessing A2, A3 and A4 cytoplasms was either similar to or significantly higher than that of their counterpart hybrids with A1 cytoplasm. Hybrids based on A3 and A4 cytoplasms produced, on average, 8% more grain compared with those based on A1 cytoplasm. This suggested that these CMS sources could be used as alternatives to A1 cytoplasm to widen the cytoplasmic base of hybrids. The results indicated that most of the variation in hybrids was accounted for by pollinator and cytoplasm × pollinator interactions, suggesting the use of genetically diverse pollinators in pearl millet hybrid breeding. © 1996 Blackwell Wissenschafts-Verlag.",Agronomic performancecytoplasmic diversity; Male sterility; Pearl millet; Penniselum glaucwn,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342422452

Mitotic counts were made for 69 species of Diascia, seven species of Nemesia, six species of Alonsoa, four species of Hemimeris, and two species of Diclis. At the species level, 80 of these counts are new reports. Counts for two genera (Diclis and Hemimeris) are also new. Diascia has a base number of x = 9 and most species are diploid. Four tetraploid and one hexaploid species were discovered among the perennials of section Racemosae, bringing the total number of polyploids for the section to seven of 26 species (ca. 27%). Two species in section Racemosae have more than one cytotype; D. patens has 211 and 4n populations, whereas D. capsularis has 2n, 4n and 6n populations. In section Diascia, consisting entirely of annuals, only five of 46 species (ca. 11%) are tetraploid, while the rest are diploid. Polyploidy has apparently had multiple origins in both sections of Diascia. The seven species of Nemesia counted were uniformly 2n = 18, but hypotheses of a close relationship between Nemesia and Diascia conflict with differences in corolla aestivation and preliminary molecular evidence. Hemimeris and Diclis are diploid with 2n=14 and appear to be closely related. Alonsoa is also related to Hemimeris with South African species having 2n = 28 and South American species mostly 2n = 56. Chromosomal, pollination and morphological differences between South African and South American species suggest that Alonsoa originated in South Africa and dispersed to South America before or shortly after the breakup of Gondwanaland.

In two populations of Aquilegia caerulea, both fruit and seed set decreased significantly between early and late flowers. Low fruit and seed set of late flowers was not due to pollen limitation. Fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when extra pollen was added to these flowers (pollen quantity), or when all flowers on an inflorescence received self or outcross pollen (pollen quality). While competition for resources occurred among flowers, resource limitation was not responsible for the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. Indeed, preventing pollination of late flowers significantly increased both fruit and seed set of early flowers, but fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when early flowers were prevented from setting fruits. Late flowers were not just smaller or larger replicates of early flowers, as they allocated more reproductive resources to male function relative to early flowers. Neither herbivory nor architectural constraints could explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. While previously published adaptive explanations proposed to explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers have emphasized a positive aspect to female reproductive success, it is suggested here that both male and female functions should be considered. Morphological data and estimates of male and female reproductive success demonstrate how, both morphologically and functionally, late flowers on inflorescences of A. caerulea specialize as males, early flowers as females. It will be argued that protandry in this sequential bloomer is expected to select for an increase in relative male allocation between early and late flowers, and that the observed pattern of resource allocation and the decrease in fruit and seed set between early and late flowers is consistent with this prediction.",Aquilegia caerulea; Architectural constraints; Floral variation; Fruit and seed set; Male function; Pollen limitation; Protandry; Reproductive success; Resource allocation; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030422748

Within years, individual Q. douglasii that flowered during periods of greater solar radiation produced more acorns, and during 1 of 5 years individual Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia produced larger crops when they flowered during warm, dry periods.

Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species diversity, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas, (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops, through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for various species groups. In the Canadian context, any serious attempt to derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.",Agriculture; Biodiversity; Field margins; Hedgerows; Wildlife habitat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030428182

Differences among clones in the average response exhibited for each physiological attribute were large, but within-clone variability was low, relative to the check group of seedlings. Selection of plant material for a hypothetical experiment from this population of several identifiable clones would have consistently resulted in an experiment with greater power than an experiment using these ramets without the clone identities. From a statistical perspective, the best approach to reduce the number of replicates needed to detect treatment differences was selection of experimental plant material from a single clone, especially with prior screening for the most homogeneous clone for the physiological attributes and time periods of interest.

There are four style shapes straight, bowed, s-shaped and hooked. However, in Dryandra, s-shaped and hooked styles are uncommon. The stigma in all cases is contained within the pollen presenter, but there is variation in the location of the stigmatic groove on the presenter, from truly apical (terminal), obliquely terminal to rarely located at the base of the presenter as in B. ericifolia. There is also variation in whether the pollen is deposited over the stigmatic groove in bud or the slit is free of pollen at anthesis. In Banksia, 73% of species studied have the groove covered with pollen, while in Dryandra, a somewhat lower proportion of species (50%) has this configuration. Pollen cohesion on the presenter varies from sticky to loose but is mostly slightly sticky. Similar pollen presenter forms occur in both genera, bul in Dryandra, the generally less elaborate shapes are more frequent than is the case in Banksia. Anatomically, the pollen presenters are quite complex, with several cell layers concentrically disposed around the central transmitting tissue. There is considerable variation in the epidermal cells of the presenters between species. In most, the cells are small and thick-walled, but in B. ilicifolia, they are very thin-walled and enlarged into elongated projections. Similar forms occur in other species. In B. tricuspis, the epidermal cells are enlarged, regularly rounded in shape and become smaller and thick-walled near the stigmatic groove. Underlying the epidermis, polyphenol-containing cells and sclerenchyma vary in proportion between species and also in their location within the presenter. The variation in wall characteristics of epidermal cells and the proportion of sclerenchyma in different species is likely to be related to maximising pollination success within an environment containing a variety of pollinator behaviours. Although vertebrates are important in pollinating many species, invertebrates are likely to be the primary pollinators of a significant number of the other species in both genera.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029834105

Somatic embryogenesis was initiated from zygotic embryo explants cultured ?8 d after pollination. Formation of a ridge of tissue began 3-4 d after culture (DAC) by divisions in the epidermal and subepidermal cells of the scutellum. Ridge formation was accompanied by a decrease in vacuoles, lipid bodies, and cell size, and an increase in endoplasmic rcticulum (ER). Proembryonic cell masses (proembryoids) formed from the scutellar ridge by 10 DAC. Proembryoid cells had abundant Golgi bodies and ER while the amounts of lipids and starch varied. Somatic embryos developed from the proembryonic masses 13 DAC and by 21 DAC had all the parts of mature zygotic embryos. Although shoot and root primordia of somatic embryos were always less differentiated than those of zygotic embryos, scutellar cells of somatic and zygotic embryos had similar amounts of lipids, vacuoles, and starch. Somatic scutellar epidermal cells were more vacuolated than their zygotic counterparts. In contrast, somatic scutellar nodal cells were smaller and not as vacuolated as in zygotic embryos. Somatic embryogenesis was characterized by three phases of cell development: first, scutellar cell dedifferentiation with a reduction in lipids and cell and vacuole size; second, proembryoid formation with high levels of ER; and third, the development of somatic embryos that were functionally and morphologically similar to zygotic embryos.",Embryogenesis; Pennisetum glaucum; Poaceae; Somatic; Zygotic embryo,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030062027

Olive pollinosis is quite rare in the form of monosensitization. Although adults are affected the most, olive sensitization can be recognized in children, too. However, it is not easy to be sure about the clinical relevance of allergic sensitization to olive, even in patients with positivity to this pollen, as results from allergological tests in vivo and/or in vitro, because positivity to Olea pollen is not equivalent to clinical responsibility, above all in patients without seasonal respiratory symptomatology. Studies on the allergenic content of O. europaea pollen are currently in progress. In Northern and Central Europe, where there are no olive trees, there are two commonly occurring genera of the Oleaceae family, namely Fraxinus and Ligustrum, but these have a low frequency of allergic sensitization. A fourth anemophilous member of the Oleaceae, Phillyrea, has a more regional distribution in some parts of the Mediterranean. Other nonanemophilous and usually not allergenic Oleaceae genera are Forsythia, Jasminum and Syringa. © 1996 S.

Nectar is produced all day but the production rate is higher at noon. The flowers are visited by insects, mainly solitary bees (Diadasia sp. and Lithurge sp.). Floral characteristics and the pollen/ovule ratio suggest that Opuntia rastrera is a facultative xenogamous species. Controlled pollinations indicate that it is not apomictic and pollinators are required to set fruit; it is also self-compatible, but there is strong inbreeding depression for fruit set. However, we were unable to demonstrate differences in reproductive characters between the populations in both vegetation types. The average density of adults per hectare was one order of magnitude higher in the nopalera (Opuntia-dominated scrublands) than in the grassland. However, the average density of plants that originated from seeds was one order of magnitude lower in the nopalera.

Much research has focused on self incompatibility (SI), an intraspecific barrier, but research on interspecific barriers lags behind. We are using crosses between Lycopersicon esculentum and L. pennellii as a model with which to study interspecific crossing barriers. The cross L. esculentumxL. pennellii is successful, but the reciprocal cross fails. Since the cross can be successfully made in one direction but not the other, gross genomic imbalance or chromosomal abnormality are precluded as causes. We showed that the lack of seed set observed in the cross L. pennelliixL. esculentum is due to the inability of pollen tubes to grow more than 2-3 mm into the style, whereas SI crosses show continued slow pollen tube growth but, also, fail to set seed. These results indicate that the unilateral response is a barrier distinct from SI, differing from SI in the timing and location of expression in the style. We therefore suggest that this unilateral response in the L. pennelliixL. esculentum cross is more accurately referred to as 'unilateral incongruity' (UI) rather than interspecific incompatibility. Periclinal chimeras were used to determine the tissues involved in UI. The results of crosses with the available chimeras indicate that the female parent must be L. pennellii at either LI (layer 1) or both LI and LII (layer 2) and the male parent must be L. esculentum at either LII or both LI and LII to observe UI similar to that seen in the L. pennelliixL. esculentum cross. Pollinations with a mixture of pollen from L. pennellii and from transgenic L. esculentum plants harboring a pollen-specific GUS reporter genemarker were used to ascertain whether the growth of the pollen tubes of either species was modified as a possible means of overcoming UI.

On six sampling dates (September, October, and November of 1992 and January, September, and October of 1993), shoot cuttings from 40 open-pollinated families in each of two progeny test sites for each breeding zone were subjected to artificial freezing at two test temperatures. Damage on each shoot was recorded as visible injury to needle, stem, and bud tissues separately. Considerable family variation was found for cold injury scores in all tissues in early fall to midfall, but differences were often smaller or nonsignificant in late fall and midwinter. Individual heritability estimates for needle cold injury were low (<0.40) and generally decreased in late fall and midwinter. Family rankings for fall cold hardiness, however, are expected to be relatively consistent over sites and years, although needles appear to display more family by-site interaction than stems or buds. Genetic correlations between tissues in cold injury varied considerably and were sometimes weak, indicating that the evaluation of a single tissue is probably not adequate for assessing overall cold hardiness of genotypes. Fall and winter cold hardiness seem to be largely under separate genetic control since genetic correlations between hardiness at these two stages were weak. This study confirms earlier results in Washington breeding populations and shows that coastal Douglas-fir families can be effectively ranked for fall cold hardiness by conducting artificial freeze tests on cut shoots in midfall (October) and scoring damage to stems and at least one other tissue.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030469389

It is suggested that the complementarity of contours is probably constrained by floral development, but patterns of coloration of tepals against background and nectar guides against tepals is constrained by pollinators' sensory physiology.",bees; flower shape; scanning behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030468657

Firstly, the flowering and fruiting phenology and the composition and structure of the pollinator guild is described, in order to compare the overall effect of mutualistic species vs. that of antagonistic species on M. moricandioides seed production. The loss of female reproductive success due to each herbivore species attacking the plant is then quantified, in an attempt to differentiate the effects on plant seed production of each herbivorous species. The results indicate that only antagonistic organisms interacting with M. moricandioides influenced the female fitness of this plant species. In fact, pollinator abundance or activity did not correlate with the number of seeds dispersed by the plants. In addition, of all the herbivore species, only sheep activity significantly influenced seed production of M. moricandioides individuals, the effect of the remaining crucivorous herbivores being cancelled by the stronger herbivory of sheep. The results of this study suggest that herbivory by sheep, in addition to decreasing the seed production of M. moricandioides, could be an important determinant of the current distribution pattern of this crucifer species on the ramblas of the Baza basin.",animal-plant interaction; arid lands; Cruciferae; mammal herbivory; Moricandia moricandioides; predispersal plant ecology; seed production; Spain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030201421

Absolute variances increased over time as the trials became older, but the rate of increase for phenotypic variance was greater than that for additive variance. Individual narrow- sense heritabilities changed over time but without showing any definite trend by species. It appeared that variance trends reflected the varying ontogenetic changes during the development of the stands, which could be indicated by size of the trees rather than by their age. Breeding strategies in tropical pines should consider the increasing intensity of environmental effects as a stand matures, since they cause a decline of genetic variances at a higher rate than phenotypic variances.

To determine a basis for skewed segregations in the progeny of the cross between Lycopersicon esculentum and L. pennellii, monogenic segregations of 16 isozyme loci were analyzed in an F2 and two backcross populations of this cross. In the F2, 9 loci mapping to chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 and 12 exhibited skewed segregations and in all cases there was an excess of L. pennellii homozygotes. The genotypic frequencies at all but one locus were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. In the backcross populations, all except two loci exhibited normal Mendelian segregations. No post-zygotic selection model could statistically or biologically explain the observed segregation patterns in the F2 and backcross populations. A pre-zygotic selection model, assuming selective elimination of the male gametophytes during pollen function (i.e., from pollination to karyogamy), could adequately explain the observed segregations in all three populations. The direction of the skewed segregations in the F2 population was consistent with that expected based on the effects of unilateral incompatibility reactions between the two species. In addition, the chromosomal locations of 5 of the 9 markers that exhibited skewed segregations coincided with the locations of several known compatibility-related genes in tomato. Multigenic unilateral incompatibility reactions between L. esculentum pollen and the stigma or style of L. pennellii (or its hybrid derivatives) are suggested to be the major cause of the skewed segregations in the F2 progeny of this cross.",Differential selection; Incompatibility; Segregation distortion; Skewed segregation; Tomato-Isozyme markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000962130

A test of 30 open-pollinated families was established near Tumbarumba (NSW) in 1989, and assessed for a numberof growth and form traits at age 5 years. Victorian provenance material, including seedling seed orchard progenies, was generally superior to NSW seed sources for growth and form traits but more prone to forking; all provenances included some superior individual families. Estimates of individual heritability were low to moderate (0.14 to 0.44) for seven growth, stem and branch form traits, with low standard errors, and very low for occurrence of forksand ramicorn branches. Genetic correlations among commercially important growth and form traits were generally moderate to high, and favourable. Selection of trees in the test to retain in a theoretical seedling seed orchard, using a multi-trait selection index, resulted in retention of 90 trees over 11 families, with high gains in growth and form (13.2 to 20.7 percent).

DIR is associated with increase in concentrations of foliage phenolics and decrease in nitrogen. The growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis contained in it, claim that DIR is caused by nutritional stress after defoliation of trees growing on nutrient-poor soils. In these environments, nutrient uptake limits plant growth more strongly than does photosynthesis; that is, carbon-based secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolics) are prone to accumulate. According to the CNB hypothesis, an excess of limiting nutrient(s) or reduced photosynthetic rate should lead to elimination of DIR. We tested this using same-aged Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa trees of five open-pollinated families growing in a common arboretum in northernmost Finland. In addition to unmanipulated control trees, we had three nutritional treatments during three successive growth seasons: N-fertilization, PK-fertilization adding all nutrients except N, and shading to decrease carbon assimilation. Half of the trees in each treatment were artificially defoliated (50% leaf area) in the second study year, one year before the growth trial with geometrid (Epirrita autumnata) larvae. Tree growth measurements showed that N is the growth-limiting nutrient in our study area. N-fertilization and shading of the trees affected foliage chemistry generally as proposed by the CNB hypothesis. For example, they reduced foliar concentrations of total phenolics and condensed tannins. The birch families differed significantly in foliage chemistry, suggesting genetic differences, but the differences were not associated with fertilizations, shading, or defoliation of the trees. Contrary to fertilizing-shade treatments, changes in leaf chemistry and E. autumnata performance caused by defoliation were not consistent with the CNB hypothesis. For example, defoliation caused significant DIR irrespective of N-fertilization or shading. There were no significant differences among the birch families in performance of the moth larvae or in effects of fertilization, shade, or defoliation on larval performance. These responses to defoliation contrast with those of some other studies, especially those on the Betula resinifera-Rheumaplera hastata system in Alaska, which provide clear support for the CNB as an explanation of DIR. We find methodological differences to be an unlikely explanation for the different results but are unable to propose any single mechanism that will explain the diverse plant responses.",Betula pubescens ssp.

In Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae), males invested a total of 11% more biomass in flowers than females. However, individual female flowers were 2.6 times heavier than individual male flowers (on a dry mass basis), had significantly heavier sepals and pedicels, but not petals, and exceeded male flowers for five linear measures. Individual female flowers also contained 2.7 times more N and 2.9 times more P than individual male flowers. In females, N (on a mg/mg basis) was concentrated in ovules, nectary, petals, and styles and P was concentrated in ovules, nectary, styles, and petals. In males, N and P were concentrated in anthers, anthophor, and petals. Within flowers, the three currencies did not always predict each other, as anthers in males and ovules and styles in females contained higher, while sepals in both sexes contained lower, proportions of both nutrients than of biomass. Flower number was highly influenced by gender, pollination, and architecture. Males produced 2.9 times more flowers than unpollinated females and 14.3 times more flowers than pollinated females. In females, pollination of flowers on one of the two main inflorescence branches significantly reduced the number of flowers produced on that branch, both in comparison to the other inflorescence branch on the same plant and in comparison to the corresponding branch on control plants. Flower number also differed between the two inflorescence branches on control plants, indicating the importance of plant architecture on flower production. It is clear that selection can lead to different reproductive allocation patterns in females and males and that these patterns may vary depending on currency and in response to pollination and architecture in females.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030427204

Pollen is a rich source of protein, but the extent to which birds digest pollen has been debated. On Isla Daphne Major, Galápagos, Geospiza scandens, the Cactus Finch, and G. fortis, the Medium Ground Finch, consume pollen and nectar of the prickly pear cactus, Opuntia echios. I found that >90% of ingested pollen was digested during passage through the gut of adult and nestling G. scandens and adult G. fortis. This value is twice as high as the maximum reported for birds, and comparable to the most efficient digestion known for specialist marsupials. Nectar is ingested with pollen by the finches and may stimulate germination of pollen in the crop, facilitating digestion. Opuntia pollen grains germinated in vitro in a nectar and water solution. Breeding of finches typically follows shortly after the arrival of the first heavy rains of the year. In 6 of 12 years, however, some G. scandens pairs bred and successfully fledged young before onset of the rains. At these times, Opuntia flowers were abundant, arthropods were scarce, and the diet of G. scandens was predominantly Opuntia pollen and nectar. As a result of breeding early, pre-rains breeders produced more clutches and fledged more young per year than post-rains breeders. Although G. fortis take pollen and nectar from Opuntia flowers and efficiently digest pollen grains, they feed on flowers to a much lesser extent than G. scandens, and did not breed before the rains. These results have implications for similar vertebrate pollinator and plant systems in arid tropical regions.",Darwin's finches; Early breeding; Geospiza fortis; Geospiza scandens; Nectar feeding; Opuntia echios; Pollen digestion; Pollen feeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030404488

The Readiness Assessment for Concurrent Engineering (RACE) is used to describe the product development process. Strengths and weaknesses of the process are thus identified. The characteristic ""Teams in the Organization"" is chosen to be improved. Benchmarking this characteristic seems to yield the best results. Companies that are willing to cooperate in this benchmarking effort are identified and approached by a benchmarking team. Information exchange on a particular characteristic leads to an improvement drive for the particular company, because it shows a performance gap and a way to bridge it. The method described above is developed for Philips Consumer Electronics Hasselt. The analysis of the current process is the most important benefit of benchmarking. RACE clearly identifies what characteristics need improvement, and thus provides a focus for the improvement process. After that, selecting a capable benchmark partner is very time consuming. Reviewing that partner's product development characteristics is hard to do from the outside. Differences in terminology used complicate the information exchange. A long-term relationship, e.g., a cross-pollination group, is therefore recommended to fully benefit from one another.",Benchmarking; Benchmarking for concurrent engineering; Concurrent engineering; Design methodology; Management of concurrent engineering; Organization of concurrent engineering; Process model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342374093

M5S 3B2, Canada","Plant mating systems are influenced by the amount and genetic composition of pollen grains deposited on stigmas and by the ability of recipients to discriminate among pollen from different sources. We describe an experimental procedure that uses limiting and excess pollinations with mixtures of genetically marked pollen to partition the siring success of donors into three components: prefertilization gamete attrition (failure of male gametophytes before fertilization), pollen competitive ability (differences in pollen tube growth rate), and postfertilization gamete attrition (embryo abortion). Regression models for the relationships of pollen load size with each pollen's siring success and total recipient fecundity indicate that, for mixtures of self and outcross pollen, differences in gamete attrition, pollen competitive ability, and postfertilization success will have distinct and predictable effects on mating patterns and fecundity. Mating systems that rely on differences in pollen competitive ability result in outcrossing frequencies that increase with pollen load size, with seed production remaining high over a broad range of load sizes. In contrast, for mating systems governed by differences in gamete attrition, the frequency of outcrossed progeny will not vary greatly with pollen load size, but reduced fecundity will be expected over a wider range of pollen load sizes. These predictions were confirmed by analyzing the response of siring success and fecundity in response to pollen load size in the tristylous Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae). Experimental manipulations of the size and composition of pollen loads allow prediction of the frequency of outcrossed progeny produced under varying pollen environments.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029730423

Pre-dispersal mortality is largely from embryo abortion, and post-dispersal predation i mostly by generalist rodents. Some seeds may survive in enforced dormancy for two or more year. Recruitment was apparently absent for more than a decade, but had previously occurred within established stands, where size classes were interspersed at random.

The main concern of introducing such herbicide resistance into commercial agriculture is the introgression of the engineered gene to related weed species. The potential of gent transfer between canola (Brassica napus and B. campestris) and related weed species was determined by hand pollination under controlled greenhouse conditions. Canola was used as both male and female parent in crosses to the related weed species collected in the Inland Northwest region of the United States. Weed species used included: field mustard (B. rapa), wild mustard (S. arvensis) and black mustard (B. nigra). Biological and cytological aspects necessary for successful hybrid seed production were investigated including: pollen germination on the stigma; pollen tube growth down the style; attraction of pollen tubes to the ovule; ovule fertilisation; embryo and endosperm developmental stages.

About 30% of the hybrid combinations developed to the heart stage of embryo development or further.

The model considers competition in preadulthood and frequency dependence produced by the increasing fraction of pollinations that are intercytotypic, and unsuccessful, as frequency decreases. Analyses of the model indicate that increasing fecundity, selfing, and niche separation between cytotypes increases the likelihood of polyploid invasibility. These findings coincide with empirical patterns and with some theoretical results previously reported in the literature. However, in disagreement with other theoretical models, the conditions for polyploid establishment are found to be less restrictive. The application of the model, given that its parameters can be quantified, is discussed. As the percentage of selfing decreases, the niche separation required for polyploid invasibility increases, and the consequences of this result for community theory are discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667543

Thus, on this basis, taxonomies may be expected to organize the data adequately for such studies when phylogenies are not available. However, phylogenies instigate particular rearrangements in plant classification that are not easily addressed by simulation, and an analysis of specific variables is used here to gain insight into the consistency of results when a large dataset is organized prior to analysis first with a taxonomy, and then with a phylogeny. This study examines commonness and rarity as it is measured by plant range size of species drawn from the floras of the islands of Great Britain and Crete. The data were restricted to native species of the main island of each group. Using a taxonomic classification of the data, both floras were investigated for the effect of range size on woodiness versus non-woodiness, and tree versus shrub life form. The flora of Great Britain was further examined for possible differences in range size due to overall plant size, and pollination and dispersal types. Using a phylogeny to organize the data, all of the same comparisons of growth form and mutualistic interactions were made for the flora of Great Britain, plus comparisons of cloning versus non-cloning, vining versus non-vining and reproductive schedule (annual, biennial and perennial). Although a phylogeny is the preferred tool for organizing that data, the results suggest that analyses using a taxonomy can lead to conclusions reliable across classification schemes. With either organizational system, trees had larger range sizes than shrubs, and win- pollinated species had larger range sizes than related non-wind-pollinated species. Additional analyses also indicated that non-clonal plants are more widespread than related clonal species. Changes in the relative position and number of contrasts within comparisons indicate that the exact effect of using a phylogeny versus a taxonomy will depend on the distribution within the phylogeny of the trait being studied.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030437207

In future, crops with new transgenic traits will probably play an important role in agricultural practice. The long-term effect of transgenes on community ecology will depend on the distribution and establishment of transgenic plants in the wild, on the sexual transfer of their new genes to the environment and on the potential ecological impact of the transgenic trait. The starting point was the use of transgenic sugar beet lines, Beta vulgaris subspec. vulgaris var. altissima DOLL (Helm 1957), with transgenes coding for rhizomania and herbicide (BASTA®) resistance. The first two questions to answer were: Can the transgenes be transferred via pollen to wild beets, Beta vulgaris subspec. maritima (L.) ARCANG. or cultivated relatives such as red beet or spinach beet and are they expressed in the hybrids? Can transgenes be monitored in young Beta vulgaris-hybrids? The experimental transfer of transgenes was conducted in 1993 at a field location in northern Germany. The beets were hand-pollinated with transgenic pollen.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic structure within and among populations of Elymus glaucus in order to make some preliminary recommendations for the transfer and use of this species in revegetation and restoration projects. Twenty populations from California, Oregon, and Washington were analyzed for allozyme genotype at 20 loci, and patterns of variation within and among populations were determined. Allozyme variation at the species level was high, with 80% of the loci polymorphic and an average expected heterozygosity (an index of genetic diversity) of 0.194. All but two of the populations showed some level of polymorphism. A high degree of population differentiation was found, with 54.9% of the variation at allozyme loci partitioned among populations (Fst = 0.549). A lesser degree of genetic differentiation among closely spaced subpopulations within one of the populations was also demonstrated (Fst = 0.124). Self-pollination and the patchy natural distribution of the species both likely contribute to the low level of gene flow (Nm = 0.205) that was estimated. Zones developed for the transfer of seed of commercial conifer species may be inappropriate for transfer of E. glaucus germplasm because conifer species are characterized by high levels of gene flow. Limited gene flow in E. glaucus can facilitate the divergence of populations over relatively small spatial scales. This genetic differentiation can be due to random genetic drift, localized selective pressures, or both. In order to minimize the chances of planting poorly adapted germplasm, seed of E. glaucus may need to be collected in close proximity to the proposed restoration site.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663442

The differences become more pronounced the further islands are from mainland sources. Altered pollination conditions have influenced the floral biology and mating systems of island plants in distinct ways. Insufficient pollination has favoured selection of floral traits promoting selling. In contrast, inferior pollinator service resulting in selling and inbreeding depression appears to be a factor involved in the evolution of sexual dimorphisms. Stochastic forces play a major role in governing patterns of genetic variation. Island populations are usually more differentiated and contain less diversity than comparable mainland samples. Many general issues in evolutionary biology can be addressed by studies of reproduction and genetics in island plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029781882

Microscopic examination of partitioned, co-pollinated pistillate flowers revealed inferior fused vein gametophyte performance. Normal pollen tubes grew faster and were significantly more abundant in the lower portion of the style. The consequences of gametophytic subvitality on seed yield and inheritance were shown by manipulating the severity of pollen competition. Fused vein, normal and F1 lines were pollinated with fused vein, normal. F1, and a 50:50 pollen mix at three different pollen loads. Fused vein pollen generated significantly fewer seed per fruit in all female genotypes. As a constituent in F1 or mixed pollen, it produced significant seed yield reductions at the low pollen load.

The typical litchi ovary has two ovules. The embryo sac was absent from about 45% of the 495 ovules studied; in about 20% of the flowers, both ovules lacked an embryo sac. While most embryo sacs had a normal polar nucleus, most did not have a normal egg cell or synergids. The percentage of flowers found to have at least one normal ovule, and so could be considered as having the potential for fruit set, fluctuated between 3.2 and 27.0. A few 'Mauritius' flowers were sampled in 11 mature commercial orchards from labelled inflorescences; almost all female flowers in these inflorescences were hand- pollinated. A significant positive correlation was found between the percentage of flowers with at least one normal ovule and initial fruit set in the same inflorescences, and even between the former and orchard yield. The presence of at least one normal synergid was found to be significantly correlated with the percentages of both normal flowers and initial fruit set. These findings suggest that ovule abnormality is one of the main factors responsible for poor litchi production. Two year old litchi plants, with small emerging inflorescences, were kept under one of three temperature regimes (day/night): cool (22/12°C), warm (27/17°C) or hot (32/22°C). Ovule normality was determined in two day old female flowers. Warm, and especially the hot temperature regimes were found to have a pronounced detrimental effect on flower development, with 'Floridian' being more susceptible than 'Mauritius'.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029767425

Heynh. cv. Columbia plants was investigated under spaceflight conditions on shuttle mission STS-51. Plants launched just prior to initiation of the reproductive phase developed flowers and siliques during the 10-d flight. Approximately 500 flowers were produced in total by the 12 plants in both the ground control and spaceflight material, and there was no significant difference in the number of flowers in each size class. The flower buds and siliques of the spaceflight plants were not morphologically different from the ground controls. Pollen viability tests immediately post-flight using fluorescein diacetate indicated that about 35% of the pollen was viable in the spaceflight material. Light-microscopy observations on this material showed that the female gametophytes also had developed normally to maturity. However, siliques from the spaceflight plants contained empty, shrunken ovules, and no evidence of pollen transfer to stigmatic papillae was found by light microscopy immediately post-flight or by scanning electron microscopy on fixed material. Short stamen length and indehiscent anthers were observed in the spaceflight material, and a film-like substance inside the anther that connected to the tapetum appeared to restrict the release of pollen from the anthers. These observations indicate that given appropriate growing conditions, early reproductive development in A. thaliana can occur normally under spaceflight conditions.

The analysis included eight populations from the European continent, five from Mediterranean islands (six subspecies altogether) and one from Tenerife (initially described as a colour form of B. terrestris but recently considered as a separate species, B. canariensis). Eight of the 10 microsatellite loci displayed high levels of polymorphism in most populations. In B. terrestris populations, the total number of alleles detected per polymorphic locus ranged from 3 to 16, with observed allelic diversity from 3.8 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 1.4 and average calculated heterozygosities from 0.41 ± 0.09 to 0.65 ± 0.07. B. canariensis showed a significantly lower average calculated heterozygosity (0.12 ± 0.08) and observed allelic diversity (1.5 ± 0.04) as compared to both continental and island populations of B. terrestris. No significant differentiation was found among populations of B. terrestris from the European continent. In contrast, island populations were all significantly and most of them strongly differentiated from continental populations. B. terrestris mitochondrial DNA is characterized by a low nucleotide diversity: 0.18% ± 0.07%, 0.20% ± 0.04% and 0.27% ± 0.04% for the continental populations, the island populations and all populations together, respectively. The only haplotype found in the Tenerife population differs by a single nucleotide substitution from the most common continental haplotype of B. terrestris. This situation, identical to that of Tyrrhenian islands populations and quite different from that of B. lucorum (15 substitutions between terrestris and lucorum mtDNA) casts doubts on the species status of B. canariensis. The large genetic distance between the Tenerife and B. terrestris populations estimated from microsatellite data result, most probably, from a severe bottleneck in the Canary island population.

Results: Overall, triamcinolone acetonide was more effective than astemizole in reducing total nasal symptoms, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing (p ? 0.01). Triamcinolone acetonide was superior to astemizole at weeks 1, 2, and 3 in reduction of the total nasal symptom score (p ? 0.0401) and in reduction of nasal stuffiness (p ? 0.05).

Plants free from HLVd were obtained by a combination of storing infected source plants at low temperature (2-4°C in the dark) for several months followed by meristem culture using small explants. A total of 77 plants of six cultivars and male pollinator clones were grown from meristems and 28 of these were free from HLVd. Tests showed that the cutting of stems (mimicking the use of tools) was more effective than abrasion (mimicking natural plant to plant contact) for the mechanical transmission of HLVd between hop plants. When field-grown test plants were inoculated, infection occurred more commonly in May before plants had grown large enough for significant contact between neighbouring plants than later in the season. The aphid Phorodon humuli could not be shown to transmit HLVd.

This study was conducted to provide information about the species' biology that might be useful in controlling its spread in native woodlands. The plant is a strict biennial in North America, spending the first year of growth as a basal rosette. This period of relatively slow growth is followed by a period of rapid shoot elongation (1.9 cm/day) during early spring of the second growing season. The plant is capable of cross- and self-pollination, although pollination and stigma receptivity occur before the flower is open, so autogamy is the most likely breeding system. Garlic mustard invests 20.4% of its biomass in reproductive effort, with an annual seed rain of 15,000 seeds/m2. Seed dispersal from fruits begins in early July and continues into October. Most seeds germinate in the spring following the year in which they were produced. Seedling recruitment is high (8.3-18.0 seedlings/dm2), but only about 7.5% of the plants survive to maturity. The success of the plant in invading woodlands appears to be related to (1) its autogamous breeding system that allows a single individual, or a few individuals, to establish populations of genetically similar but interfertile individuals; (2) high seed production, permitting establishment of large numbers of individuals; and (3) rapid growth during the second growing season, which increases its competitive ability. Because of garlic mustard's ability to occupy understory habitats successfully, it may be unrealistic to expect to eliminate the plant from many habitats it has already invaded.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030430182

Implications of these genetic parameters for wood quality improvement were discussed. Although wood density, earlywood density and latewood density show smaller phenotypic variation than growth traits, a larger part of the variation in these traits is due to families. These traits are under strong genetic control (hi2ranges from 0.60 to 0.86, and hf2ranges from 0.56 to 0.68). Wood density has a strong genetic correlation with earlywood density and latewood density (+0.72 and -0.73, respectively), but earlywood density and latewood density are strongly related to each other. As a result, wood density components have little value in improving the efficiency of selection for overall wood density. Overall wood density shows negative genetic correlations with growth traits (ranging from -0.34 to -0.41). To achieve optimal genetic gains, therefore, index selection for multiple traits is essential. This study reveals that selection for dry mass weight would result in remarkably higher genetic gain in gross fibre yield than selection for bole volume alone (+14.15% and +9.28%, respectively). Furthermore, selection for dry mass weight would result in less reduction in wood density, and while holding wood density at zero change, it is still possible to obtain huge genetic gain in gross fibre yield. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041012594

A new hypothesis for the inheritance of the leaf spininess trait based on the observed segregations is put foward. It clearly explains the segregation of 11 out of the 13 artificial crosses, whereas the current accepted hypothesis (Collins and Kernes, J. Heredity 37: 123-128, 1946) explains only eight of the 13 crosses. Three crosses were crucial for the acceptance or rejection of both hypotheses. The crosses Boituva x Smooth Cayenne and Perola x Smooth Cayenne, which involve 'non-piping' and heterozygous for the S locus (Ss) parents, gave rise to spineless individuals in the offspring, at the expected frequency of three spiny to one spineless. This fact cannot be explained by Collins and Kernes' (1946) hypothesis. The cross Roxo-de-Tefe x Rondon resulted in nearly 100% spiny descendants, different from the frequency expected by the Collins and Kernes' hypothesis (50% spiny: 50% spineless). The new hypothesis allows the identification of two new clones as 'piping' types (Manauara Inerme and Pina Negra) and confirms that the genotypic constitution of the Rondon clone is probably ppss (spineless 'non-piping'). When the genotype is pp, the S locus produces the completely spiny phenotypes (ppSS and ppSs), which are dominant over the spineless one (ppss). The partial leaf spininess of the cultivar Smooth Cayenne, described as heterozygous for the S locus (ppSs), must be caused by genotype x environment interactions, genetic background effects, modifying genes and/or other unknown facts. Green leaf color has incomplete dominance over purple leaf color, but green predominates.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029567043

Genome mapping techniques now widely adopted in plant8,9 and animal10,11 breeding make it possible to investigate the genetic basis of reproductive isolating mechanisms in natural populations.

This article describes the formation of and selection within a genetically broad-based gene pool for resistance to rice blast (Pyricularia grisea Sacc.), and progress during one generation of selection. Thirty rice lines of diverse origin were chosen as parents based upon stability of the reaction of the lines to a range of leaf (Bl) and panicle (NBl) blast races during eight growing seasons at a location favorable for disease development ('hot spot' site). Each parent was crossed to five other parents and each F1 to three other F1's to ensure recombination. The resulting seeds were bulked to form the GC-91 gene pool (C0P0). Genetic diversity, as measured by geographical origin of the germplasm, was higher in the GC-91 than in the 'genetic core' of rice varieties grown in Latin America and the Caribbean. Three groups were selected from GC-91, based upon three different objectives of selection for blast: a) rapid fixation of major genes for high levels of resistance (population C1P1), b) gradual accumulation of polygenes for partial resistance (population C1P2), and c) a combination of objectives a and b (population C1P3).

It was then assessed around 3 individual ramets by comparing genotypes of effective pollen with those of pollinator and surrounding trees located in a circle or in an ellipse focused on the receptor tree. The best prediction of genetic diversity of effective pollen was obtained considering a maximum pollination distance of about 20-30 m and an elliptical pollen dispersal. Effective pollen dispersal took place preferentially along rows of trees and probably depended on the wind. As the flowering period was short and particularly synchronous in the year of seed collection, reproductive phenology probably did not favour some peculiar crosses.

BET1 mRNA was shown to encode a 7-kD cell wall polypeptide. Both the mRNA and protein were restricted in their distribution to the basal endosperm transfer layer and were not expressed elsewhere in the plant. BET1 expression commenced at 9 DAP, reached a maximum between 12 and 16 DAP, and declined after 16 DAP. The initial accumulation of the BET1 polypeptide reached a plateau by 16 DAP and declined thereafter, becoming undetectable by 20 DAP. The antibody raised against the BET1 protein reacted with a number of polypeptides of higher molecular mass than the BET1 monomer. Most of these were present in cytosolic fractions and were found in nonbasal cell endosperm extracts, but three species appeared to be basal cell specific. This result and the reactivity of exhaustively extracted cell wall material with the BET1 antibody suggest that a fraction of the protein is deposited in a covalently bound form in the extracellular matrix.

Male flowers differ from female ones in having a stunted style (style in female exserted from corolla and deeply bifurcating) and anthers filled with fertile pollen (anthers in the female lacking pollen). The size of the corolla and number of florets per head were similar between male and female flowers. The crown area of this arboreal species was also similar in male and female plants. The sex ratio was 0.55 male, not significantly different from 0.5. Both sexes produced nectar of similar sugar concentration (ca. 50%). The flowers are pollinated by feral honeybees (Apis mellifera), but they are thought to have been pollinated by small, lesshairy, endemic solitary bees before honeybees were introduced and subsequently became the dominant bee species on the island. The evolution of dioecy of Dendrocacalia on the island is thought to stem from the deleterious effects of inbreeding that are inherent in plants with geitonogamy. The increased geitonogamy on the island has resulted from increased woodiness (i.e., increased number of flowers per plant) and the original dependence on endemic bee pollinators, which are now endangered. © 1995 Botanical Society of Japan.",Bonin Islands; Compositae; Dendrocacalia; Dioecy; Feral honeybee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21344456667

For two-dimensional gels, ovaries were sampled at 36 h after pollination, at which time pollen tubes have penetrated much of the length of the style but have not yet entered the ovary. At least 11 major proteins from pollinated ovaries had no detectable counterparts in unpollinated ovaries. These showed a range of molecular mass and pI. For peroxidase isozyme assays, ovaries were sampled at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after pollination. At 45-50 h, pollen tubes were beginning to enter the top of the ovary but could still be separated from the ovules and placenta during sampling. Ovules and placentae from unpollinated pistils showed only one form of peroxidase, whereas those from pollinated pistils showed additional isozymes at pH 5.4 and pH 10.0. Both new isozymes increased in staining intensity over the first 36 h after pollination. At 48 h, however, the acidic peroxidase had continued to increase, while the basic component had declined so as to be barely detectable. The observations are discussed in relation to accumulating evidence that some form of pollination-induced signal reaches the ovary ahead of the advancing pollen tubes.

To monitor recombination events, we generated several lines of transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carried a cryptic ?-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene which was designed in such a way that expression of the reporter gene could be induced by R gene-mediated recombination. We also made several transgenic lines with an R gene linked to the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus. Each transgenic line carrying the cryptic reporter gene was crossed with each line carrying the R gene. Activity of GUS in F1 and F2 progeny was examined histochemically and recombination between two RSs was analyzed by Southern blotting and the polymerase chain reaction. In seedlings and plantlets of F1 progeny and most of the F2 progeny, a variety of patterns of activity of GUS, including sectorial chimerism in leaves, was observed. A small percentage of F2 individuals exhibited GUS activity in the entire plant. This pattern of expression was ascribed to germinal recombination in the F1 generation on the basis of an analysis of DNA structure by Southern blotting. These results indicate that R gene-mediated recombination can be induced in both somatic and germ cells of A. thaliana by cross-pollination of parental transgenic lines. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",?-Glucuronidase; Arabidopsis thaliana; Deletion; R-RS recombination system of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii; Site-specific recombination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029014592

In Brassica napus and B. oleracea, compatible pollination is followed by a dramatic activation of protein synthesis in the pollen involving the synthesis of approximately 40 proteins. After incompatible pollinations in B. oleracea, virtually no newly synthesised polypeptides were detected in the pollen except for a small group of high molecular weight proteins which were not normally synthesised during compatible pollinations. Both compatible and incompatible pollinations were followed by the appearance of newly phosphorylated proteins in the pollen; these fell into four distinct groups. In B. oleracea, the number of phosphorylated proteins and the degree of phosphorylation of individual proteins within the four groups differed between compatible and incompatible pollinations. One group of phosphorylated proteins appeared to correspond with the small group of high molecular weight polypeptides which were synthesised in pollen after incompatible pollinations. These findings are discussed in the perspective of cell signalling during the pollen-stigma interaction in Brassica and also in terms of their possible implication in sporophytic self-incompatibility. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Brassica oleracea; Pollen protein phosphorylation; Pollen protein synthesis; Pollen-stigma interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001183552

CMS synthetics are produced by compositing a CMS A-line with several male-fertile (MF) B-lines lacking nuclear alleles for fertility restoration, and increasing the resulting mixture by natural pollination. Over generations of increase, pollination of the CMS component by the MF component of the synthetic results in the progressive loss of A-line nuclear genes from the population. The initial proportions of CMS and MF plants are expected to be preserved over several generations of natural pollination if CMS and MF plants are equal in yield. Methods for estimating the heterozygosity level of CMS synthetics, taking into account the proportion of CMS plants, number of MF parents in Syn 0, and selfing rate (s) of MF plants, are presented. If completely inbred Syn 0 parents and s of 0 and 0.75 for CMS and MF plants respectively, are assumed, the heterozygosity level (1-F) of a synthetic derived from four inbred MF parents each comprising 6.25% of Syn 0 and one inbred CMS parent comprising 75% of Syn 0 is predicted to be 0.66 in Syn 5, compared to 0.30 in synthetics derived from four MF parents only.

The evidence for anthropogenic activity in pollen diagrams has focused on indirect indicators such as forest clearance, burning and increases in arable weeds. Tracing individual cultivars has proven to be very difficult as the major cultivated plants, in this case dominated by root crops, have low pollen production, are insect-pollinated or are harvested before flowering occurs. The identification of some cultivars is further restricted by limited information on pollen morphology. The pollen morphology of selected species from two genera (Pandanus and Colocasia), known to include important cultivated species, have been studied. Five pollen taxa are recognised after examination by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It is shown that these can be easily distinguished on the broad criteria of pollen class, grain size and size of echini. The taxonomic and dispersal characteristics of the pollen morphology of these taxa are discussed and the implications of improved identification of cultivated species in late Quaternary pollen records are considered. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Colocasia; Early agriculture; New Guinea; Pandanus; Pollen morphology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21844493237

The striped area is pale green at the seedling stage, and turns yellow and white at maturity, extending from the leaf blade to the sheath and the internode below the sheath. The mutant does not breed true and following self-pollination, produces three different types of progeny: green, striped and completely affected. The green type permanently loses the mutant character, while the completely affected type is lethal, without any green tissue. Only the striped type transmits the mutant phenotype to progeny, and it has a clonal distribution on the ear. Its phenotype is inherited maternally and its expression is unaffected by the paternal genotype. It cannot be inherited through the paternal parent. This pattern of inheritance, which persists after three cycles of backcrossing with the affected types as the recurrent pistillate parent, suggests that the responsible gene is located in the cytoplamic genome. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Cytoplasmic genome; Leaf-striped mutant; Maize-maternal inheritance; Nonchromosomal mutant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249771750

Structural features of the predicted polypeptide include an N-terminal hydrophyllic domain, a region containing blocks of leucine-rich repeat elements (LRR) and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains at the C-terminus. The LRR region of the SF17 protein contains nine imperfect tandem repeats of 24 amino acids in length, which are homologous to the leucine-rich repeats found in a variety of proteins widely distributed among eukaryotic cells. The analysis of a genomic copy encoding the SF17 protein revealed the presence of two introns. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension analysis. During pollen development SF17 mRNA was detected only in mature pollen grains indicating that the SF17 gene belongs to the class of 'late' pollen genes.

The most common pollinators are bees collecting nectar, pollen, or oil; other pollinators are moths and butterflies, hummingbirds, syrphid flies, and (in one case) ants. The occurrence of bell-shaped corollas in most tribes of the Scrophulariaceae and in related families indicates that this is the basic (ancestral) flower form. Derived from it are narrow tubular corollas, wide flaring ones, corollas closed to unsuitable visitors by a palate (an upcurving of the tube), corollas forming a keel around the style and anthers either on the upper or lower side of the flower, corollas inflated to form a balloon, and corollas with one or two spurs. Convergences due to selection by the same or similar pollinators limit the usefulness of most of these floral features in analyzing the systematic relationships of the tribes of the Scrophulariaceae.

While temporal variation in pollinator composition has been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous observations were conducted in seven pairs of black mustard populations. The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large populations. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Black mustard; Brassica nigra; Pollinator assemblage; Population size; Spatial variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981294

We studied pollination dynamics in wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, a plant visited by four groups of pollinators: honey bees, small native bees, butterflies, and syrphyd flies. The effects of anther position and other factors on pollen removal during single visits by all four pollinator taxa were measured. Flowers with high anther exsertion (i.e., anthers placed higher above the opening of the corolla tube) tended to have the highest numbers of pollen grains removed, but this effect was strongest for honey bees and butterflies. For all pollinator taxa, pollen removal increased with the number of pollen grains available on a flower and whowed a positive, decelerating relationship with the duration of the visit. The effects of stigma position and other factors on pollen deposition during single visits by honey bees and butterflies were also studied. The nectar-feeding butterflies had a higher pollination efficiency (percentage of pollen grains removed from anthers that were subsequently deposited on a stigma) than the nectar- and pollen-feeding honey bees. Flowers with intermediate stigma exsertion had the highest numbers of pollen grains deposited on their stigmas by butterflies, but stigma exsertion had no effect on deposition by honey bees. For both butterflies and honey bees, pollen deposition on the recipient flower increased with the amount of pollen removed from the donor flower, and there was a positive, decelerating relationship between deposition and time spent at the flower; these results are analogous to those for pollen removal. The effects of anther and stigma exsertion on pollen removal and denosition did not fit predictions based on patterns of floral correlations, but results for morphology, pollen availability, time spent per visit, and pollinator efficiency are in broad agreement with previous studies, suggesting the possible emergence of some general rules of pollen transfer. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Anther and stigma exsertion; Floral correlations; Floral morphology; Pollination efficiency; Raphanus raphanistrum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981299

The present paper deals with representatives of 6 of the 9 known salpiglossidean genera. Previous observations are updated and discussed at the tribal level. Most species studied are butterfly- or moth-pollinated. With the exception of Salpiglossis, the fertile floral parts are concealed in the corolla tube, and their arrangement is specially suited for deposit of the pollen on the lepidopteran tongue. Particularly notable are (a) abundant stigmatic secretion that makes the pollen sticky, and (b) versatile anthers that optimize contact between the tongue and the thecae. Brunfelsia and Browallia exhibit a mechanism analogous to that of Apocynaceae, however, with two entrances instead of five. When the tongue is inserted, it is forced to contact the stigma and becomes glued with its secretion. When the tongue is pulled out, it touches the anthers and causes slight balancing movement. In Streptosolen, very probably an ornithophilous descendant of the Browallia stock, the mechanism is much simplified. Leptoglossis and Hunzikeria bear a novel device for pollen deposition: there are two fertile wheel-like anthers that are capable of full rotation up to eight turns. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",anther structure and function; Floral mechanism; pollination; Solanaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029104507

Initially, 48 ""females"" of A. schottii were hand-pollinated with pollen collected from 1 m, 10 m, 100 m, and 2500 m distances. Each female received all four distance treatments. Additionally, a subset of the focal females and their pollen donors were used in an analysis of genetic similarity across the four distances. Results of hand-pollinations showed that crosses of 1 m had significantly lower seed set than 10 m and 100 m crosses. Crosses of 2500 m had intermediate seed set. Combined relative fitness was significantly lower for 1 m crosses compared to 10 m crosses, while 100 m and 2500 m crosses were intermediate. Thus, A. schottii experiences inbreeding depression and a trend toward outbreeding depression. Genetic analyses showed a similar pattern: individuals 1 m apart had on average higher genetic similarity (proportion of bands shared) than individuals separated by greater distances, with a trend toward lower genetic similarity for plants located 2500 m distant. The observed spatial genetic patterns are likely maintained by the combined effects of clonal reproduction, clone longevity, limited seed dispersal and the substantial number of inbred progeny produced, counteracting distant allele transfer which tends to reduce population genetic structure. The correspondence between our ecological and genetic results indicates that RAPD markers are useful tools for assessing ecological phenomena. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Agave schottii; Clonal reproduction; Inbreeding and outbreeding depression; Optimal outcrossing; RAPDs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028814892

Emissions from the petals differed quantitatively between the apical and basal petal regions, thereby paralleling optical nectar-guide patterns. Pollen odor was markedly unlike that of other flower parts, with only few volatiles, a high representation of 5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone (protoanemonin), and no detectable trans-?-ocimene. The distinctiveness of the pollen's volatile profile suggests that it may serve a signalling role to pollen-feeding insects. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Floral biology; flower volatiles; GC-MS; isoprenoids; nectar guides; olfactory stimuli; phytochemistry; pollen odors; pollination; protoanemonin; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028814116

A first DH line that originated from the open-pollinated (OP) cultivar 'Dorata di Parma' was obtained after overcoming difficulties associated with the haploidy of the regenerants. Spontaneous chromosome doubling occurs seldom in onion. The first DH line obtained was cloned and selfed to produce sufficient seeds for genetic studies. The homozygosity of the DH gynogenic line was revealed on the basis of the low standard deviations of the bulb traits polar diameter, shape index and weight with respect to those of the S1 line or the OP cultivar. In the DH line, moreover, segregation of RAPD and alpha esterase markers was not noted. Out of four primers revealing polymorphism at 16 ge-netic loci in the OP cultivar 'Dorata di Parma', none produced polymorphism in the DH gynogenic line. The Est-1 locus, homozygous in 22 plants (Est-11/1 in 3 and Est-12/2 in 19) and heterozygous (Est-11/2) in 11 plants of the OP cultivar, always carried the same alleles in the DH line. We also tested genetic stability during micropropagation of a second halpoid line obtained via gynogenesis from var. 'Senshyu Yellow'. Seventeen plants of this line were tested to detect changes occurring during the tissue culture process. Again no polymorphism was observed. The high genetic homogeneity observed in the two gynogenic lines of onion could be related to the absence of the callus phase during the gynogenic process. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Agronomic evaluation; Gametoclonal variation; Genetic homogeneity; Gynogenesis; Isozyme; RAPD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001361129

The first step in altering the oils is to survey existing corn breeding materials for fatty acid composition. The Latin American Maize Project (LAMP), an international program designed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of maize accessions in Latin American and U.S. germplasm banks for future use, provides useful starting materials. LAMP was based on the cooperative efforts of 12 countries. In a two-stage evaluation, the project identified the highest-yielding open-pollinated top 20% of populations, then approximately the top 5% of those 20%. Twenty of the populations from four countries with temperate climates were randomly selected for fatty acid analysis. The populations were from United States, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. Fifty S1 lines from each population were randomly chosen for analysis for a total of 1,000 genotypes sampled. Statistical differences in fatty acid composition were computed among the 20 populations and among the four countries. The findings showed a wide range of fatty acid profiles present in unadapted, elite corn breeding materials with ranges for each fatty acid as follows: palmitic acid, 6.3-18.2%; stearic acid, 0.9-4.5%; oleic acid, 18.5-46.1%; linoleic acid, 36.6-66.8%; linolenic acid, 0.0-2.0%; and arachidic acid, 0.0-1.4%. Several populations were significantly different from the others. Some lines had unusual fatty acid compositions, including one with 8.3% total saturates and another with 20.2% total saturates. This study shows that existing corn breeding materials could be used to produce high- and low-saturate oils, but other methods would probably be required to produce a high-oleic corn oil. © 1995 AOCS Press.",Corn breeding materials; corn oil; fatty acid composition; genetic differences; Latin American Maize Project,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249166349

In this study, I estimated outcrossing rates and levels of inbreeding depression in Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), providing the first empirical test of hypotheses about the evolution of breeding systems in plants with submerged flowers. This study also addressed temporal separation of female and male flowering (dichogamy) in eelgrass as a mechanism promoting an outcrossing mating system, and whether the mating system in eelgrass is related to the degree of dichogamy in the field. Outcrossing rates (0<t<1) estimated from two polymorphic allozyme loci indicate that the Z. marina population in intertidal and subtidal habitats in False Bay, Washington, USA, was highly outcrossing in both 1991 (intertidal t=0.905, subtidal t=1.0) and 1992 (intertidal t=0.775, subtidal t=0.611). The outcrossing rates were positively associated with the degree of dichogamy in 1992; intertidal plants exhibited a greater temporal separation of female and male flowering and a higher outcrossing rate than did subtidal plants. Inbreeding depression at seed set was estimated from hand pollinations (self- and outcross) on 20 reproductive individuals from the False Bay population. Averaged across all maternal parents, a greater proportion of outcrossed flowers set seed than selfed flowers; i.e., inbreeding depression was detected. Plants exhibited genetic variation for inbreeding depression, detected as a significant pollination treatment × maternal family interaction in a log-likelihood analysis. By the end of the seed-maturation period (7 mo after intial seed set) some families showed outbreeding depression, i.e., greater fitness in progeny derived from selfing than in progeny from outcrossing. The inbreeding depression in the False Bay population may be an important selective factor contributing to the maintenance of dichogamy and an outcrossing mating system, as proposed for aquatic plants. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029431702

Plastids and mitochondria in the egg cell are significantly different from those of the sperm cell. Egg plastids are starch-containing and less electron dense. They appear circular, elliptical irregular elongate in sections. Sperm cell plastids are relatively electrondense, mostly cup-shaped or dumbbell and devoid of starch granules. Mitochondria of the egg cell are giant and mostly cup-shaped while sperm mitochondria are smaller and usually circular in section. Double fertilization is completed by 24 h after pollination and the pollen tube can be seen in the degenerated synergid. In the zygote, plastids and mitochondria from male and female gametes can be distinguished by their characteristic differences. Moreover, paternal and maternal organelles appear to be distributed at random in the zygote. Aside from the pollen tube and its released starch granules, there is no enucleated cytoplasmic body in the degenerated synergid. Two days after pollination, the zygote undergoes one transverse division to form a 2-celled proembryo which consists of one larger vacuolated basal cell and one smaller densely cytoplasmic apical cell. Paternal and maternal organelles can be detected in both cells of the proembryo and also in the endosperm at this stage. From these results, it can be concluded that plastids and mitochondria from both male and female gametes have been transmitted into the apical cell of the proembryo and most probably to the following generation. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Biparental inheritance; Fertilization; Mitochondrion transmission; Pelargonium; Plastid transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029155287

Since the duration of receptivity is critical in these population level models, we also determined the influence of individual selection on this phenological trait. The models give three major results: (1) The minimum fig population size required to sustain a wasp population increases with the amplitude of seasonality, and decreases with increasing duration of receptivity; (2) tree population reproductive success is higher when the duration of receptivity is longer and when the population is large, but (3) individual selection toward a long duration of receptivity is weak or absent. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Coevolution; Conservation biology; Ficus; Mutualism; Receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028978861

Analysis of the methylation status of the HRS60 DNA revealed that these sequences were hypomethylated in the progenies up to the extent found in the parental 5-azaC-treated plant. Since no parent-of-origin effect was observed, we presume that both male and female gametes transmit an artificial methylation imprint to a similar extent.

However, optimal seed size does not depend on the total resource allocation if the total number of pollen grains captured by a plant increases linearly with its flower number. In addition, the optimal seed size is not always positively correlated with the optimal resource allocation to pollen capture mechanisms per flower.

In our experiments we analyzed, by Feulgen cytophotometry, chromosome endoreduplication in endosperm cells of two maize genotypes, IHP and ILP, having high and low protein content in their seed, respectively. Chromosome endoreduplication occurs in both lines within 24 days after pollination, attaining a maximum ploidy level of 384C (7 DNA replication rounds) in IHP and of 192C (6 replication rounds) in ILP. In the mature seed, endosperms of the two lines show different mean ploidy level. In reciprocal crosses between IHP and ILP the f1 endosperms have mean ploidy levels analogous to that of the maternal parent, showing that the difference in ploidy level between the two genotypes is maintained. After selfing of the f1 plants, the difference in ploidy level between the two F2 populations is reduced. In F2 the mean ploidy level is as variable as in f1, indicating the absence of genetic segregation. From our data, it is apparent that both the genetic constitution (cytoplasmic and nuclear) of the maternal parent and the genotype of the individual endosperms influence the ploidy level. An analysis of the protein content in endosperms carried out on the same seed sample as analyzed cytophotometrically showed that the protein content increases, during seed development, parallel to chromosome endoreduplication and varies, in the two lines, in reciprocal crosses and their progeny, according to the same trend as mean ploidy level, suggesting a correlation between the two parameters. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Chromosome endoreduplication; Endosperm; Protein accumulation; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029189459

The antisense construct contained part of the cruA gene in an inverted orientation, and the gene was driven by the 5? flanking region of the gene for napin such that antisense RNA was expressed in a seed-specific manner. The construct was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. In self-pollinated seeds (T1 seeds) of transgenic plants there was a reduction in the levels of the ?1 ?1 and ?2/3 ?2/3 subunits of cruciferin, whereas the level of the ?4 ?4 subunit was unchanged. The total protein and lipid contents of transgenic seeds did not differ significantly from that of normal seeds. Seeds with reduced amounts of cruciferin accumulated higher amounts of napin than non-transformed seeds, but the level of oleosin was unaffected. Amino-acid analysis of the seed storage protein revealed that T1 seeds with reduced amounts of cruciferin contained higher relative levels of three essential amino acids, namely, lysine, methionine and cysteine, with increases of 10%, 8% and 32% over the respective levels in non-transgenic seeds (B. napus cv Westar). © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Amino-acid composition; Antisense; Brassica napus; Cruciferin; Seed storage protein,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000406658

Previous protocols require up to 9 to 12 months to obtain similar results. Procedures unique and important to this protocol include; a modified ""whole-leaf"" transformation coupled with a long duration of cocultivation, resulting in high rates of transformation, high levels of kanamycin in selection media resulting in few escapes, and extensive rooting of regenerants prior to a greenhouse hardening procedure. Once in the greenhouse, primary regenerants were maintained in small containers with long day photoperiod and high light levels, greatly shortening the time to seed set. Flowers from primary transformants were bagged to allow self pollination, and seed capsules harvested and dried prior to normal maturation on the plant. T1 and T2 seeds were plated and selected on kanamycin media by an improved seed plating technique which eliminates the need for the placement of individual seeds, saving time and improving selection homogeneity. Using this protocol, over 130 independent tobacco lines from six separate gene constructs have been generated in a very short time period.

The crater continues as a slit-like canal through the style and into the ovary. Both crater and canal are lined by several layers of fusiform and thin-walled cells which are continuous in two narrow regions in the ovary. Post-anthesis and before pollination, the middle lamella of cells lining the stigmatic crater and stylar transmitting tissue undergoes dissolution. This occurs in a progression down the style with cells separating partially or wholly from neighbours. Dissolution is initiated at intercellular junctions where wall fibrils loosen and variously-sized and -shaped holes appear. Cytoplasmic changes include increased dictyosome activity, increased rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum at the periphery of cells and accumulation of electron opaque deposits at the plasma membrane. The crater fills with stigmatic fluid and the diameter of the stylar canal increases. Pollen germinates in the secretion-filled crater, and pollen tubes grow down the style between the cells of the transmitting tissue but do not enter the canal. They emerge at the entrance to the ovary cavity and grow over one or two narrow strips of ovarian transmitting tissue cells which are present throughout the length of the ovary close to the ovules.

In this paper we present natural population data on the floral biology and reproductive ecology of the endemic Mediterranean speciesCyclamen balearicumWillk. This is a long-lived, diploid perennial herb which occurs in southern France in five fragmented and isolated regions and on the Balearic Islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Cabrera and Draponera. Our observations indicate a particularly scarce pollinator activity (rare syrphid visits) and dispersal by ants over small distances. A controlled pollination experiment in a natural population showed that in southern FranceC. balearicumis fully self-compatible and that selfing is autonomous and probably delayed (i.e. following opportunities for outcrossing). The proximity of stigmas and anthers will favour autonomous selfing. The high pollen/ovule ratio indicates nevertheless thatC. balearicumhas a mixed mating system. Patterns of variation in stigma-anther separation and pollen production per flower suggest that not only has the current mating system of the species evolved from an outcrossing ancestor but that due to the fragmentation and isolation of populations greater levels of selfing have evolved in southern France (and to an intermediate degree on Ibiza and Menorca). On the island of Mallorca where larger continuous belts ofC. balearicumhabitat still exist the species has floral traits indicating a more outcrossed mating system. To our knowledge this is the first paper to document such trends in floral traits in the endemic component of the Mediterranean flora. © 1995 The Linnean Society of London.",ant seed dispersal; autonomous selfing; habitat fragmentation; herkogamy; pollen/ovule ratio; pollinator unreliability; self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028833377

The cultivar 'Nonpareil' was the maternal parent in all crosses. Pollination was achieved using eight different cultivars, and a total of 3200 individual kernels were assessed. For each isozyme the goodness-of-fit test was used to test for departure from the expected frequencies assuming Mendelian inheritance. Given a higher than expected number of significant results for individual isozymes, independent segregation between pairs of isozymes was tested using the chi-square statistic on the resulting two-way contingency tables. In all crosses a highly significant association (P value< 0.001) was observed between (1) the AAT- 1 and IDH isozymes loci and (2) the LAP-1 and PGM-2 isozymes loci, which leads to the conclusion that the respective isozyme pairs are linked. In addition, a significant association (P value < 0.001) was observed between LAP-1 and GPI-2 when the pollen sources were 'Fritz', 'Mission', or 'Price', but this could not be tested for the remaining five pollen sources, 'Carmel', 'Grant', 'Keane', 'Ne plus Ultra', 'Peerless', because they are homozygous at these loci. If LAP-1 is linked with GPI-2 and PGM-2, it might be expected that we should find evidence of linkage between GPI-2 and PGM-2. The lack of a significant association between these two isozymes suggests that LAP-1 is located centrally on the chromosome. These three pairs of linked loci are the first to be reported in almond. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Isozyme; Linkage; Loci association; Prunus dulcis (Mill) D. A Webb,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004717341

Diabroticite beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are strongly attracted to Cucurbita blossoms, and 2- to 3-fold olfactory synergism has been demonstrated in four species by combinations of the key blossom volatiles, 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, indole, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde. This TIC mixture represents an optimized Curcurbita blossom volatile kairomone mixture useful in monitoring Diabroticite populations and in studying their behavior and ecology. Indole, which exhibits a spectrum of attraction to these beetles ranging from moderate for Diabrotica virgifera virgifera and Acalymma vittatum to very weak for D. barberi, is the primary synergistic component. Indole combined with 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde was significantly synergistic to D. v. virgifera at a ratio of 1:300 and produced 4-fold synergism at a ratio of 1:1. Indole combined with 4-methoxyphenethanol was less synergistic to D. barberi with 1.5- to 2-fold synergism at a 1:1 ratio.

This map includes 93 segregating marker loci distributed throughout the maize genome, providing a saturated linkage map that is suitable for linkage analysis with quantitative trait loci (QTL). This population, which has been immortalized in the form of sibbed F2:3 families, was derived from each of the 214 F2 plants and along with probe data are available to the scientific community. QTL analysis for kernel sucrose (the primary form of sugar) concentration at 20 days after pollination (DAP) uncovered the segregation of seven major QTL influencing sucrose concentration; a locus linked to umc36a described the greatest proportion of the variation (24.7%). Since maltose concentration has previously been reported to be associated with the se1 phenotype, an analysis of probe associations with maltose concentration at 40 DAP was also conducted. The highly significant association of umc36a with maltose and sucrose concentrations provided evidence that this probe is linked to se1. Phenotypic evaluation for the se1 genotype in each F2:3 family enabled us to map the gene 12.1 cM distal to umc36a. In contrast to previous work where se1 was reported to be located on chromosome four, our data strongly suggest that the sugary enhancer1 locus maps on the the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 2 in the maize genome. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Quality; se1; Sucrose; Sweet corn,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001425634

The system involves the active collection of pollen by females of two prodoxid moth genera and the subsequent purposeful placement of the pollen on conspecific stigmas of species of Yucca. Yuccas essentially depend on the moths for pollination and the moths require Yucca ovaries for oviposition. Because of the specificity involved, it has been assumed that the association arose once, although it has been suggested that within the prodoxid moths as a whole, pollinators have arisen from seed predators more than once. We show, by using phylogenies generated from three molecular data sets, that the supposed restriction of the yucca moths and their allies to the Agavaceae is an artifact caused by an incorrect circumscription of this family. In addition we provide evidence that Yucca is not monophyletic, leading to the conclusion that the modern Yucca-yucca moth relationship developed independently more than once by colonization of a new host.",coevolution; mutualism; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029092508

The endosperm represents a significant contribution to the grain yield of maize; thus, methods that facilitate the study of cellular kinetics may be useful in discerning cellular and molecular components of grain yield. Two mathematical models have been developed to describe the kinetics of endosperm growth. The first describes the kinetics of mitosis during endosperm development; the second describes the kinetics of DNA endoreduplication during endosperm development. The mitotic model is a modification of standard growth curves. The endoreduplication model is composed of six differential equations that represent the progression of nuclei from one DNA content to another during the endoreduplication process. Total nuclei number per endosperm and the number of 3C, 6C, 12C, 24C, 48C, and 96C nuclei per endosperm (C is the haploid DNA content per nucleus) for inbred W64A from 8 to 18 days after pollination were determined by flow cytometry. The results indicate that the change in number of nuclei expressed as a function of the number of days after pollination is the same from one yearly crop to another. These data were used in the model to determine the endosperm growth rate, the maximum nuclei number per endosperm, and transition rates from one C value to the next higher C value. The kinetics of endosperm development are reasonably well represented by the models. Thus, the models provide a means to quantify the complex pattern of endosperm development.",flow cytometry; growth; mitosis; modeling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029083606

Several studies show a strong influence of either resource limitation, pollen limitation or a combined effect of both. The theoretical arguments for resource limitation are abundant, but there has been very little work done concerning the effect of pollinator availability. In this paper we construct a model to study how the reproductive success in plants is influenced by the foraging behaviour of the pollinators. The pollinator population is assumed to have a constant population density. A functional response function for the pollinators is derived. It is similar to a Holling type II functional response. It is shown that, since the pollinators are regulated by factors not included in the model and their capability to pollinate is limited by the functional response, this is sufficient for regulating the plant population. There also exists a threshold condition for the persistence of the plant population that depended on the search rate of the pollinators and the demographic parameters of the plant population. If this threshold condition is not satisfied the plant population cannot persist and will become extinct. If the condition is satisfied the plant population grows until it is limited at the equilibrium mentioned above. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.",functional response; plant regulation; pollen limitation; pollinator foraging behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981133

This idea was partially tested using artificial character variation for petal size in Drosera tracyi. This plant opens one flower each morning, with stigmas becoming available and pollen being presented simultaneously throughout the population. Bees remove all the pollen that can be removed and deposit all the pollen that can be deposited in one or two visits. Visitation rates track blooming density, as do pollen removal and deposition. I measured selection as the difference in pollen removal and deposition between flowers with trimmed petals versus flowers with normal petals. In one meadow, I found a wide range of levels of pollination and corresponding levels of selection, and selection was strongest at intermediate levels of pollination. This might mean that organisms are adapted to conditions when resources are at intermediate levels even though they may experience those conditions relatively rarely. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.",Drosera tracyi; natural selection; pollination; resource levels,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981455

Percentage seed set of open-pollinated plants (50-57%) did not differ within or between years, and was about 19% less than experimentally cross-pollinated plants (70-75%). Floral visits by honeybees did not differ through the flowering season and the number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas within 12 h of flowers opening exceeded the number of ovules per flower, indicating that the quality rather than the quantity of pollination limited seed set. Pollen limitation was caused by concurrent self- and cross-pollination and the subsequent abortion of some selfed ovules due to inbreeding depression. Natural seed set (55%) was intermediate between selfed (43%) and crossed (75%) flowers and was not increased when flowers that had been available to pollinators for 24 h were hand cross-pollinated, suggesting that ovules were already fertilized. Similarly, experimental pollination with both cross and self pollen within 24 h of flowers opening did not increase seed set relative to natural seed set, indicating that both cross- and self-fertilizations had occurred. In contrast, when selfing followed crossing by 48 h, or vice versa, seed set did not differ from crossed-only or selfed-only flowers, respectively, indicating that ovules were pre-empted by the first pollination. Collectively, these results indicate that under natural conditions self pollen pre-empts ovules, rendering them unavailable for cross-fertilization. This selfing reduces fecundity by 50%, as estimated from the natural production of cross seeds when selfing was prevented. Consequently, selection should favour floral traits, such as increased stigma-anther separation or protandry, that reduce interference between male and female functions that leads to selfing. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Blandfordia grandiflora; Facilitated selfing; Ovule pre-emption; Pollen limitation; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028980973

A small insert genomic library of the bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was constructed and screened for the presence of (CA/GT)n and (GA/CT)n repeats. The proportion of positive clones yielded estimates of 3×105 such dinucleotide repeats per genome, roughly comparable to abundances reported in other eukaryotic genomes. Thirteen positive clones were sequenced. In contrast to mammalian genomes, the (GA/CT)n motif was more abundant than the (CA/GT)n motif in these clones. The (GA/CT)n repeats also showed longer average repeat length (mean n=16.2 versus 7.3), suggesting that they are better candidates for yielding polymorphic genetic markers in oak genomes. Indeed, a survey of adult bur oaks and offspring in a small stand in northern Illinois at 3 of these (GA/CT)n microsatellite loci revealed Mendelian inheritance and extremely high levels of polymorphism, with the number of alleles at each locus ranging from 11-20 and heterozygosity ranging from 0.66 to 0.75.

Segregation distortion was observed for approximately one-third of the markers, perhaps due to the interspecific nature and the reproductive (i.e. self-incompatibility) differences between peach and almond. This map will be used for adding other markers and genes controlling important traits, identifying the genomic locations and genetic characterizing of the economically important genes in the genus Prunus, as well as for markerassisted selection in breeding populations. Of particular interest are the genes controlling tree growth and form, and fruit ripening and mesocarp development in peach and almond. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Linkage map; Molecular markers; Prunus spp.; RFLPs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001534998

CMF is a reversible defect in pollen germination or tube growth; pollen is nonfunctional in self-crosses but fully functional in outcrosses or when supplied with specific flavonol aglycones at pollination. CMF occurs in maize and petunia mutants that lack chalcone synthase (CHS) activity and therefore do not synthesize flavonols. In maize CMF seedlings and developing male florets, CHS transcripts accumulate to high levels, yet western blot analysis using an anti-CHS antiserum does not detect any CHS protein. This is in contrast to CMF petunia, where no CHS RNA is detected (Vogt et al. 1994). While CMF petunia pollen requires flavonols to germinate, CMF maize pollen germinates and grows both in vivo and in vitro without the addition of flavonols. However, pollen tubes abort after 12 h of growth which explains the lack of seed set in self crosses (Mo et al. 1992). Pollen tubes of CMF maize have an unusual morphology in vivo, with heavy callose deposits throughout the tube and tips that burst within the silk. Normal tube morphology and seed set are restored by adding flavonols to the silks at pollination. As previously shown with petunia, fecundity (seed set) may be enhanced in maize by adding quercetin and kaempferol at pollination. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Conditional male fertility; Flavonols; Maize; Petunia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000298092

Special attention was paid to the way the pollen tube gains access to the ovule. A single anatropous ovule with a big funiculus occupies the entire ovary cavity. At anthesis, a physical gap exists between the ovule and the base of the style. However, upon pollen tube arrival a protuberance, the ponticulus, develops in the uppermost area of the funiculus between the style and ovule. This structure appears to facilitate access to the ovule by the pollen tube. The pollen tube penetrates the ovule via this ponticulus. Upon penetration, callose develops in the ponticulus cells surrounding the pollen tube. After pollen tube passage, the upper layer of the ponticulus lignifies and isolates the ovule from the style. This separation is further enlarged 2 weeks later when the ovary starts to develop without expansion of the ovule and a large gap develops separating the ovule from the style. Except for the induction of callose formation by the pollen tube in the funiculus, this process is independent of pollination and appears to be developmentally regulated since it occurs in the same way and at the same time in pollinated and unpollinated flowers. The ponticulus, although by a different mechanism, appears to be playing the role of an obturator regulating access of the pollen tube to the ovule. Furthermore, this access is restricted to a particular time during the development of the ovule. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Chalazogamy; Ovule; Pistacia vera; Pollen tube; Ponticulus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008006819

In Gasteria, the percentage of in vitro micropylar penetrations is comparable with the penetration percentage in vivo. The penetration efficiency was related to the season, stage of flower development and method of emasculation. Micropylar penetration in vitro is independent of the orientation of the micropyle. Multiple pollen tube penetration occurs as in vivo, and pollen tubes show a preference for micropyles with micropylar exudate. All these observations indicate that an attractant is present in this exudate. After washing the ovules with different solvents before in vitro pollination, the penetration percentage can be influenced. Washing with solvents affecting proteins remarkably influences the rate of penetration, suggesting that the possible attractant has a proteinaceous component. Incompatible as well as interspecific and intergeneric pollinations, both for Gasteria and Lilium, were applied and resulted in micropylar penetration. The observed penetration of Gasteria pollen tubes in the micropyle of Lilium ovules points to a non-specific micropylar attraction. © 1995.",Gasteria; In vitro micropylar penetration; Interspecific and intergeneric crosses; Lilium; Micropylar attraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028890659

We have identified a single temperature-sensitive mutation, embryoless 1 (eml1), affecting both embryo and endosperm development. At a high temperature, eml1 causes embryoless seeds containing large endosperm. Rarely, small embryos with or without organs are formed. At a low temperature, however, the frequency of embryoless seeds drops and seeds are often detected which contain a large embryo and a defective or no endosperm. Thus, in this mutant, embryo size is negatively correlated with endosperm size. Temperature-shift experiments suggest that this mutant becomes insensitive to the temperature change after 4 days post pollination. Accordingly, the seed phenotype of this mutant would be temperature-dependently determined before 4 days after pollination. The negative correlation in size between embryo and endosperm suggests that they developmentally interact from the early stage of seed formation. © 1995.",Embryo size; Endosperm; Mutation; Rice; Temperature-sensitivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028843087

Different clones produced seeds in 0-8% of caged cross-pollinated flowers and in 5-19% of cross-pollinated non-caged flowers. Ulluco is thus basically an outbreeder. Experiment 2 studied whether seed set is limited by pollen availability. Total seed number per inflorescence number did not differ between plants treated with supplemental pollen and control plants; pollen availability thus did not limit seed set. The treated plants, however, produced more seeds in cross-pollinated than in other flowers on the plant, and the control flowers on treated plants produced fewer seeds than those on the control plants. In the treated plants, resources may have been allocated to artificially cross-pollinated flowers at the expense of other flowers.

To promote the exchange of ideas between fields I compare approaches, concepts, and problems faced by researchers working in each area. Both vegetative and reproductive interactions may generate assemblage structure through ecological sorting or through character displacement. Vegetative interactions may lead to assemblage organization more often by ecological sorting and reproductive interactions more often by character displacement. Vegetative interactions generally operate over shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales than reproductive interactions and may be affected more strongly by temporal and spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic environments. These differences affect how the concept of ecological niche should be applied to plants. The Hutchinsonian concept of niche needs to be significantly modified before it can be usefully applied to plants. Null models are a valuable tool for investigating both vegetative and reproductive structuring of plant assemblages; however, the procedures followed in the application of null models need further refinement. The appropriate formulation of the null model may require information that is unavailable, hence multiple models may have to be employed to ""bracket"" conclusions. The literature on pollination community ecology demonstrates that difficult decisions must be made about the likely processes that have generated the structure being tested, the relevant definition of sympatry, how guid membership should be defined and employed, and what constraints should be incorporated into the null model to impose realism. Differences in these decisions will affect the outcome of the analysis. While top-down studies of pattern have numerous advantages, they usually cannot identify the process(es) that have generated the patterns. Bottom-up, experimental studies can be useful for identifying the processes, but they can rarely be used to assess the structure of an entire natural assemblage. The optimal approach to studying assemblage structure is to detect patterns with top-down analysis and use experiments to identify the processes that generate and maintain the patterns. © 1995 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.",Assemblage structure; Character displacement; Competition; Ecological sorting; Flowering phenology; Niche concepts; Null models; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249163152

The theory employed in this evaluation procedure can be used to investigate the possibility of reducing the number of plants visited in a population, when species set all of their seed by cross-fertilisation, by taking several seeds from each. We show that it is not worth taking more than eight seeds from each plant and that, in the absence of precise information about the paternity of this seed, it might be better to follow the general recommendation of Lawrence et al. (1995), by taking only one seed from each of the 172 plants. Having investigated the minimum sample size for genetic conservation in the narrow sense, we broaden discussion to consider sample size for evaluation and regeneration. It is pointed out that it is not necessary to take more than about ten seeds from each of 20-30 randomly chosen plants in each population visited and that it is possible to reduce this number of plants if material from a number of populations is evaluated in a single trial. Finally, we draw attention to the possibility of regenerating seed from a composite population founded by raising one plant from the seed taken from each plant of the original collection, as an alternative to regenerating the seed of each accession independently from that of every other. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",cross-fertilisers; evaluation; genetic conservation; natural progenies; sample size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028796426

In a replicated trial grown at the same time, seed yield, 100 seed weight, number of pods per plant, seeds per pod, and number of flowers per inflorescence were also evaluated. A high number of BPL accessions failed to set seeds in the screen houses without tripping, the mean seed index measure of autofertility was 0.51 with a C.V. of 74.2%. There were marked differences among countries of origin for autofertility, with Egypt having the highest (SI = 0.94) and the USSR the lowest (SI = 0.26) autofertility, however, most countries expressed a large range, suggesting that breeders should first look in their own material for this trait rather than searching in exotic germplasm. In general, there was a higher level of autofertility in Middle Eastern countries that may be due to natural selection for non-dependency on pollinators for high yield. Contrary to the findings of others, large seeded accessions had a high autofertility (SI = 0.704) compared to small seeded accessions (SI = 0.384), however, both had similar ranges. In general, there was no significant correlations among autofertility and yield and its components. The variability found in this large pure line collection for autofertility is of potential use for developing cultivars not dependent on insect populations for high yield and for developing self-pollinated faba bean. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",autofertility; faba bean; germplasm; inbreds; pure lines; Vicia faba L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029135813

Further, variation in the total number of species, variation in the number of species belonging to a guild and non-randomness in species composition of guilds were studied. A number of criteria for guild definition were used, such as life form, Grime's C-S-R strategy, phenology, plant height, pollination and dispersal syndromes, leaf shape and anatomy and taxonomy at the family level. The observed variation in the number of guild species corresponded to the null model in which species assemblages with fixed species richness per square were randomly generated from the species pool. The observed variation in the number of guild species was often higher than the variation calculated for randomly distributed species whereas the variation in the proportion of guild species was in some cases lower than the variation calculated for randomly distributed species with fixed frequencies.

The survey was carried out in 1991 and 1992, using two Burkard spore-traps, both set up at the University of Cordoba, Faculty of Sciences. Generally, and for all herbaceous plants, pollen detection started and ended around the same date on both samplers. However, in the case of Olea europaea, the pollen was detected in advance by the sampler located at 1.5 m compared with the one located at 15 m, probably due to the fact that olives growing close to the low sampler flower before the great olive plantations located some 60 km south of the city. No significant differences between the counts of both samplers have been observed, except in the case of Urticaceae, where the sampler situated on top of the building recorded higher pollen concentrations in both years. Similar annual peaks of Urticaceae are probably due to the buoyancy of their small, light grains and the explosive pollination mechanism which liberates pollen grains from the anthers of the Urticaceae family, including Urtica and Parietaria. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In this paper we present the molecular cloning of a cysteine proteinase and show that its expression is regulated by ethylene and associated with petal senescence. A 1600 bp cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 5?-specific primer and 3?-nonspecific primer designed to amplify a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase cDNA from reverse-transcribed stylar RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned product (pDCCP1) was found to share significant homology to several cysteine proteinases rather than ACC synthase. A single open reading frame of 428 amino acids was shown to share significant homology with other plant cysteine proteinases including greater than 70% identity with a cysteine proteinase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Amino acids in the active site of cysteine proteinases were conserved in the pDCCP1 peptide. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that the expression of pDCCP1 increased substantially with the onset of ethylene production and senescence of petals. Increased pDCCP1 expression was also associated with ethylene production in other senescing floral organs including ovaries and styles. The pDCCP1 transcript accumulated in petals treated with exogenous ethylene within 3 h and treatment of flowers with 2,5-norbornadiene, an inhibitor of ethylene action, prevented the increase in pDCCP1 expression in petals. The temporal and spatial patterns of pDCCP1 expression suggests a role for cysteine proteinase in the loss of protein during floral senescence. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Dianthus caryophyllus; ethylene; pollination; proteinase; senescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029310609

In this paper we aimed to have an insight into the physiological basis of pre-harvest sprouting resistance in this crop by assessing germinability, ABA embryonic content and embryonic sensitivity to ABA during seed development in three varieties presenting contrasting sprouting behaviour: Redland B2 (very susceptible), SC 650 (moderately resistant) and IS 9530 (very resistant). Redland B2 caryopses were able to germinate with high germination indices from early stages of development, while caryopses from IS 9530 did not present germination indices different from 0 until near physiological maturity. SC 650 (moderately resistant) grains presented an intermediate pattern of behaviour. In all three varieties isolated embryos were able to germinate with maximum germination indices from as early as 15 d after pollination (DAP). Differences in grain dormancy level were not paralleled by a consistently different endogenous ABA content throughout maturation. However, when ABA embryonic content was measured in incubated 35 DAP caryopses, ABA level in B2 embryos after 24 h of incubation was found to be less than half that observed in IS 9530 embryo after the same period of incubation. In addition, B2 embryos were found to be 10-fold less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of ABA than embryos from the other two varieties. These results explain to a considerable extent differences in germinability between sproutingresistant and -susceptible varieties and are consistent with differences in sprouting behaviour. © 1995 Oxford University Press.",Abscisic acid; Germination; Pre-harvest sprouting; Seed development; Sorghum bicolor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028831777

Its asynaptic nature and chromosomal stickiness lead to the unequal segregation at anaphase I (AI) in PMC's. The observed values in 18 segregation patterns, 17:17 to 0: 34, were different from the expected values estimated from random segregation of chromosomes. Nevertheless, the preferential transmission of special chromosomes among genomes A (x=8=a1-a8) and B (x=9=b1-b9) had not occurred. As the result of unequal segregation, the pollen grains with various chromosome numbers were observed. Almost all of the 200 pollen grains contained chromosome numbers more than 17 (range 8 to 34). The observed values of each chromosome number were roughly similar to the expected values of containing the complete set of genome A or B in the random distribution without preferential segregation of chromosomes at AI. The difference between the index of polien mitosis and the pollen fertility was significant in the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and suggested the selection for some genomically unbalanced pollen grains during maturation. Consequently, viable pollen grains with various chromosome constitutions are a few (mean pollen fertility of 5.8%) but might produce many aneuploids by self- and cross-pollination. © 1995 The Botanical Society of Japan.",Aneuploid; Asynapsis; Liliaceae; Meiosis; Pollen mitosis; Scilla scilloides,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249755005

To examine potential causes of highly leptokurtic deposition, we introduce four functions that arise when (1) the duration of pollinator visits to pollen sources is limited, (2) the rate of pollen deposition varies randomly among pollinators and/or among visits, (3) the rate of pollen deposition changes monotonically over time or (4) pollen is carried in layers or compartments on the pollinator's body that differ in deposition rate. Maximum likelihood techniques were used to fit deposition functions to data obtained from honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) visiting mustard plants (Brassica campestris L.) that contained a marker gene. Each of the alternative leptokurtic functions fit the experimental data better than a simple exponential function and the best-fit function predicted a mean pollen dispersal distance more than three times greater than the exponential.

Pin flowers collected about 75 pollen, and thrum flowers about 25 pollen by the end of the day of anthesis. The net result was about 15 compatible pollen per flower on both floral morphs.

Pollen removal, seed set, and the behavior of two bee visitors (Bombus and Halictus) were assessed in flowers that had 0%, 50%, or 100% of their petal lobes removed. Pollen removal rates did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups, probably due to the presence of an ineffective (""ugly"") pollinator (Halictus), which quickly removed pollen from completely reduced flowers. Seed set was significantly positively correlated with petal size. Bumblebees discriminated against reduced flowers, thereby lowering pollen movement to reduced flowers. Halictid bees rarely contacted stigmatic surfaces and thus pollen delivery to reduced flowers was limited. The presence of an ugly pollinator probably obscured the effect of petal reduction on pollen receipt, thus masking the impact of attractive structures on male fitness. Given the positive relationship between seed set and petal size, we caution against ascribing expenditure on attractive structures exclusively to male function.

The medium from germinating pollen contains several pollen exudate proteins as well as glycoproteins from the sticky pollen wall coating. No protein could be detected in the stigmatic exudate. The stylar fluid shows a protein pattern different from that of the placental fluid. The placental fluid contains some glycoproteins. After pollination, three pollen proteins begin to appear in the stylar fluid. Two of these pollen proteins remain present in the placental fluid. Some placental fluid proteins and glycoproteins are modified after pollination. The difference in protein patterns demonstrates the heterogeneity of proteins in the pollen tube pathway and suggests that proteins excreted by the pollen tube interact with other proteins in the pistil pathway, especially those in the placental fluid. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Gasteria verrucosa; Glycoproteins; Pollen tube pathway proteins; Protein exudate of germinating pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029163950

The M3h fruiting male was also selfed. The sex ratio was checked in maternal families of A. kolomikta (2n=2x) and A. chinensis (2n=2x) as well as in A. deliciosa. Seedlings of both diploid species took 3-4 years to progress beyond juvenility, whereas a noticeable number of seedlings from biparental crosses of A. deliciosa involving A12 and Hw1 as seed parents were still non-flowering after seven growing seasons. Open-pollinated families of both diploid and hexaploid species as well as most families from biparental crosses showed a sex segregation ratio approaching 1:1. Subandroecious lines with different degrees of ovary and pistil development appeared in proportions of 0-4.2%, depending on the cross, but only 6 of the 2567 male vines checked were capable of setting fruit. No case of self-fertility or apomixis was detected among 1866 bagged female vines. Selfed M3h progenies gave only female and male phenotypes in a ratio of 1 female to 3 males. No off-type vines were found among these progenies. The same disomic sex segregation ratio seems to be operating at different ploidy levels in the genus Actinidia. Since selfed fruiting males produced both female and male individuals, the male sex appears to be the heterogametic one. Such evidence indicates that a monofactorial system based on one or more linked genes or on an X/Y chromosome set must be controlling sex expression. How a monofactorial sex-determining mechanism could operate in polyploids to give a 1:1 female: male ratio is discussed. Minor modifying gene(s) seem to be responsible for the feminization of males, and their expression appears enhanced by environmental conditions.

We demonstrate that the tube cell can convey the sperm cells to the ovule and effect fertilization even in the absence of the pollen grain and the spent pollen tube. Adhesion is an integral part of cell attachment and movement in animal systems. We show that in vivo-grown pollen tubes grow beneath the cuticle of the stylar transmitting tract epidermis and directly adhere to one another and the outer wall of the epidermal cells. A fibrous wall material is found to cover the tip of the pollen tube cell wall and the surface of the transmitting tract cells where the two adhere. Fixation methods to preserve adhesive compounds were used. The pollen-tubes grown in vivo, but not in vitro, show star-shaped clusters of F-actin microfilaments in the region back from the tip, as seen by rhodamine-phalloidin staining.

It has been suggested that these proportions could be regulated by producing short-styled and long-styled flowers such that pollinator wasps could only use the former as their ovipositor does not reach the ovules of the latter. Thus the wasps can lay eggs only in the short-styled flowers and raise their offspring, and the ovules of uninfested, long-styled flowers can develop into seeds. This implied that figs bear dimorphic female flowers, with a bimodal distribution of style length. However, recent studies have shown that style length is distributed normally, with no evidence of bimodality. Therefore the regulation of allocation of flowers to the wasps does not seem to be through the production of two distinct kinds of female flowers. In this article we suggest that two factors govern the proportion of flowers rewarded to the wasps: (i) passive regulation, which is a consequence of the optimization of wasp ovipositor length, and (ii) active regulation, where figs are selected to enhance the variance of style length. We show that these arguments lead to certain predictions about the optimum ovipositor length, the proportion of the flowers available to the wasps, and the coefficient of variation of style length. We also show that data for 18 fig-wasp associations conform well with these predictions. We finally suggest that the regulatory process outlined here can be extended to evolution of style length in dioecious fig species also. © 1995 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Agaonidae; coevolution; Ficus; ovipositors; pollinators; style length; wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038202829

In contrast, the magnet-species theory predicts that a nectarless plant benefits from growing in the vicinity of nectarcontaining species. We tested these hypotheses by adding attractive, nectar-containg violets (Viola x wittrockiana) to orchid populations. The percentage of fruit set in D. incarnata was adversely affected by the violets, probably because interspecific exploitation competition for pollinators took place in favour of the violas at the expense of the orchids.

We collected nectar from Impatiens capensis in a nested design: three flowers from each of three plants from each of three populations. This design enabled us to quantify variation within individual plants, among plants within populations, and among populations. Using high performance liquid chromatography, we analyzed the sugar and amino composition of the 27 flowers. Analysis of variance showed that none of the parameters (volume, concentrations of three sugars and 24 amino compounds) varied within individuals. Variation in nectar volume was not significant among plants but was nearly significant among populations. Of the three sugars detected (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), the only significant variation was that of sucrose among populations. Concentrations of 12 amino compounds varied significantly at the plant level while 7 amino compounds varied among populations. The results indicate that: (1) pooling of nectar samples from flowers of individual plants can be an acceptable methodology for those seeking to understand within species variation; (2) amino compounds appear to vary more than either volumes or sugar concentrations; (3) future studies should assess how much of the observed variation is due to genetic versus environmental differences; (4) additional studies should examine the geographic variation in nectar parameters and pollinators of I. capensis in order to assess the role different pollinators play in shaping nectar composition. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Amino acids; Impatiens capensis; Nectar; Sugars,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029168310

We have established a relationship by means of a polynomic regression originating from the mean cumulated temperature higher than 9°C [R2 = 0.927 (P = 0.0001)], with the pollination season starting from 300°C and the maximum peak at 356°C, in the 3 years of the study. During the days of pollination, peaks higher than 50 grains/m3 coincide with average daily temperatures of 18.7 ± 3 and lower than 50 grains/m3 with temperatures of 16.8 ± 3 (significant to 95%). The duration of the pollination is influenced by the cumulated average temperatures (from 800 to 900°C) and especially by precipitation at the start of and during pollination. In order to forecast grass pollination, the cumulated average temperatures are useful, starting from a basal (9°C), pollination begins when this sum is greater than 300°C, whereas when 800°C is reached and depending on the rainfall during the season, pollination will end. The total severity of pollination seems to depend on the rainfall prior (in the same year) to the start. During pollination, the days with an average temperature of 187 ± 3°C and an absence of rainfall between 4 and 12 h, will be the days with a presence of more than 50 grains/m3. Thus, it is possible to forecast and estimate risk factors in the long-term (by means of the rainfall prior to pollination) and in the short-term (for the following day, if a weather forecast is available) so as to offer it to those members of the population affected by pollinosis.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028931011

This study was designed to determine if immunotherapy with an alum adsorbed partially purified Parietaria extract (Alpare Parietaria) containing a targeted maintenance dose of 12500BUs was effective in decreasing rhinitis symptoms in patients allergic to Parietaria. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled technique 36 patients received placebo or active extract for 2 years. Twenty (11 placebo and nine active) completed the 2 year study. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated by determining changes in skin reactivity, visual analog scores, diary symptom scores and end of study assessments. Reactions were monitored as well. Skin-test suppression was marginally significant in the actively treated group after 1 year and showed even more significant suppression after the second year. Nasal block, rhinorrhoea and sneezing all were significantly decreased in the active group. The nasal provocation test did not show a significant change after 1 year, in either group, but after 2 years of treatment the active group did show significant improvement.

I tested whether floral symmetry reliably reflects phenotypic quality measured in terms of pollinator rewards and whether pollinators respond to floral symmetry in a series of observations and experiments on Epilobium angustifolium (Onagraceae). Lower petal asymmetry was negatively related to mean lower petal length, whereas asymmetry in leaf width was positively related to mean leaf width. Flowers visited by bumblebees were larger and more symmetrical than the nearest neighboring flower. This relationship between pollinator preference for large and symmetrical flowers was demonstrated to be causal in experiments in which the lower petals were manipulated symmetrically or asymmetrically. Nectar production was larger in symmetrical flowers, and this may explain the bumblebee preference for flower symmetry. Floral symmetry therefore reliably reflects nectar production and hence enhances pollen transport. Extensive embryo abortion has been documented in E. angustifolium and other outcrossing plant species.

Pollen : ovule (P : O) ratios of the European orchids surveyed range from 10 : 1 (Goodyera repens) to 24 : 1 (Platanthera chlorantha). Average pollen-load : ovule ratios are consistently lower than P : O ratios. Naturally occurring pollen loads range from 1 massula to >1 pollinium. Even the smallest pollen load is sufficient to stimulate embryogenesis in experimentally pollinated Dactylorhiza purpurella flowers, although more seeds are set with larger loads. Pollen tubes grow rapidly through the stylar canal and into the top of the ovary within 2 or 3 days of pollination, and grow down either side of the 3 parietal ridges in the ovary. Fertilisation occurs throughout the length of the ovary but its distribution is non-random, especially when pollen loads are limiting, with more seeds being set at the stylar end. All species of Dactylorhiza, Ophrys, and Orchis studied are highly self-compatible. In the absence of pollination, Ophrys and Orchis flowers remain open and fertile for at least 3 weeks. Pollinated flowers remain receptive to further pollinations for at least 8 days. Some fruits can even be obtained on selfing 20-day-old unpollinated Orchis morio flowers. Excised pollinia retain germinability for a long time, up to 51 days in Dactylorhiza purpurella. The arrival of pollen on the stigma hastens floral senescence, but post-pollination changes are relatively slow when compared with those reported for tropical orchid species. It is concluded that characteristics of the pollination biology of European orchids act to maximise reproductive success by (1) prolonging the opportunity for effective pollen deposition both pre- and post-pollination, (2) increasing the likelihood of widespread dispersal, (3) reducing pollen wastage, and (4) increasing seed quality by promoting some pollen competition. As most European orchids are xenogamous and require pollen to arrive on the stigma before seed can be set, reproductive maximisation is of particular adaptive advantage because many of them are infrequently visited by insects so that the probability of successful pollination can be very low. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Orchid pollinia; Pollen loads; Pollen longevity; Pollination limitation; Post-pollination events; Reproductive maximisation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002778793

We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify 12 abundant compounds in the floral headspace from two inbred lines of C. breweri. These volatiles are derived from two biochemical pathways, one producing acyclic monoterpenes and their oxides, the other leading from phenylalanine to benzoate and its derivatives. Linalool and linalool oxide (pyran form) were the most abundant monoterpenoids, while linalool oxide (furan form) was present at lower concentrations. Of the aromatic compounds detected, benzyl acetate was most abundant, whereas benzyl benzoate, eugenol, methyl salicylate, and vanillin were present as minor constituents in all floral samples. The two inbred C. breweri lines differed for the presence of the additional benzenoid compounds isoeugenol, methyleugenol, methylisoeugenol, and veratraldehyde. We also analyzed floral headspace from C. concinna, the likely progenitor of C. breweri, whose flowers are odorless to the human nose. Ten volatiles (mostly terpenoids) were detected at low concentrations, but only when headspace was collected from 20 or more flowers at a time. Trans-?-ocimene was the most abundant floral compound identified from this species.

Although ants were less abundant on flowers than other visitors, they were the most effective pollinators. Some qualitative factors of this mutualistic ant-plant interaction may account for their effectiveness: the small size of the ants, their high visitation rate to pistillate flowers, and the lack of reduction in viability of the pollen transported on the integument. In addition, the sedentary nature of ants assures their presence during the flowering period.

Reproductive biology of this species has been studied in Southern Italy over a period of 4 years with both field and laboratory experiments. In all the studied populations male plants predominate over the females, have a higher flower density and flower regularly every year while females are usually alternate-bearing. A strong negative association between fruit formation and vegetative growth has been found indicating that the presence of fruits on a branch reduces the growth of new shoots. This phenomenon, together with alternate-bearing, is evidence of a strong competition between vegetative growth and reproductive activity and indicates resource limitation. Flower morphology and quantity of pollen produced are typical of insect pollinated species, and flies of the Empididae and Muscidae were trapped bearing pollen at female plants but pollen is also dispersed by wind. Field experiments on pollination success showed that the exclusion of insects as pollen vectors produces a significant decrease in fruit development. Excess pollen provided by hand-pollination increases fruit set over open-pollination and reproductive success in the field is therefore pollen limited. The variability of sex expression, male fitness, fruit production, regrowth and pollination presented here suggests that these predispersal characteristics of R. alaternus have been subject to evolutionary change since the tropical Tertiary climate was replaced by a Mediterranean one. This points to the possibility that reproductive, as well as morphological and physiological characteristics, may be equally selected for in extreme environments such as the Mediterranean. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Alternate-bearing; Dioecy; Mediterranean species; Pollination; Reproductive biology; Sex expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002931422

Flowers of forest trees provide subsistence for honey bees and the trees physically provide shelter for a swarm or bee hive. Forest management and beekeeping have each had a long history both in the United States and globally, but have seldom been integrated or studied in a systematic fashion. Purposeful plantings of trees, as in agroforestry systems, could be designed to favor bee forage or hive protection. Tree growing and beekeeping can easily be combined for several reasons. Both are sustainable on land that is hilly or otherwise less desirable for other agricultural purposes. Both require labor intermittently, and can be sustained while the grower/beekeeper is busy with other farming occupations. Bee hives require very little space, while the bees themselves can forage in a radius of 4 to 5 km. Hives may be located within or near a tree plantation, and utilize both the trees and surrounding other flowering plants for forage. Combining forestry and beekeeping provides annual honey bee products (e.g. honey, beeswax) to supplement income from a landowner's long term forest managements. In areas like Kentucky, where more than half of the forest landowners own 4 ha or less of commercially valuable woodland, it is important to produce economic benefit from those lands without harvesting all the trees.

When germinated on agar, Gasteria pollen tube elongation lasts for up to 8 h while plasma streaming continues for about 20-24 h. The generative cell divides between 7 and 20 h after germination, and after 20 h the pollen tube arrives at one of the synergids. The sperm cells arrive after 22 h. The whole process takes more time in vitro than in vivo. In fast growing pollen tubes, a pulsed telescope-like growth pattern of tube elongation is observed. The formation of pollen tube wall material precedes tube elongation and probably prevents regular enlargement of the pollen tube tip-zone. Rapid stretching of the new pollen tube wall material follows, probably due to gradually increased osmotic pressure and the use of lateral wall material below the tip. The stretching ceases when the supplies of plasma membrane and excretable wall material are exhausted. Multiple pollen tube penetration of the micropyle occurs in vitro as it does in vivo. Most pollen tube growth ceases within the micropyle but, if it continues, the pollen tubes curl. Inside the micropyle the pollen tube shows haustorial growth. At the ultrastructural level, the wall thickening of in vitro pollen tubes is quite similar to that in vivo. Before transfer of pollen tube cytoplasm a small tube penetrates one of the synergids. Sperm nuclei with condensed chromatin are observed in the pollen tube and the synergid. In vivo prometaphase nuclei are found in the most chalazal part of a synergid, against the egg cell nucleus and nucleus of the central cell at a later stage. Using media for Lilium ovule culture, Gasteria ovules were kept alive for at least 6 weeks. Swelling of the ovule depends on pollen tube penetration. The conditions for fertilization to occur after in vitro ovular pollination seem to be present. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Gasteria; In vitro micropylar penetration; Lilium; Pulsed pollen tube growth; Sperm cell transfer; Synergid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002430943

This study consisted of 19 oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars and breeding lines and three species of wild oats, and focused on comparison of several physiological screening methods  CO2 exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance, stomatal resistance, disparity between air and leaf temperatures, accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and proline, and relative water content (RWC)  with yield losses. Early drought, occurring at four-five leaf stage or close to pollination date resulted in significantly reduced above-ground vegetative biomass and panicle weight. Reductions in panicle weight due to drought were greater than those in vegetative phytomass, which resulted in decreased harvest index (HI). Drought stress significantly increased stomatal resistance and accumulation of ABA and proline, whereas stomatal conductance, disparity between air and leaf temperatures and RWC, decreased owing to water deficit. Comparison of screening methods by calculating drought tolerance indices showed that none of the indices was associated with degree of yield losses. However, photosynthetic characters correlated with RWC both at early growth stages and close to pollination. Therefore, further studies that profoundly evaluate the relationship between these screening methods and degree of yield losses are needed. © 1995, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

The genetic basis of seed size variation was examined with a diallel breeding design. The analysis did not reveal any evidence for additive genetic variance, suggesting that seed size could not evolve in response to natural selection. A series of greenhouse experiments was conducted to determine the sensitivity of seed weight to a number of ecological variables. Seed weight was affected by inbreeding depression: seeds produced by self-pollinations were significantly lighter that outcrossed seeds. Maternal plants did not differentially provision seeds that were the result of crosses between subpopulations (separated by 300 m) or between populations (separated by 1.7 km). Mean seed size was independent of the number of outcrossed pollen donors (one vs. many) that sired seeds on an inflorescence; however, the variance was greater on inflorescences pollinated by multiple donors. Direct manipulations of the abiotic environment showed that seed size was greater on plants growing under full sunlight compared to shaded plants. Seed size was unaffected by soil type, fertilizer addition, or defoliation. Finally, I determined the effect of varying pollination intensity at the level of a single inflorescence, and at the whole plant level. Seed weight was greatest on plants that had only 1 and 5 inflorescences pollinated, and least on those that had 10 and 20 pollinated. At the inflorescence level, seed weights were greatest on those where all flowers were pollinated, compared to inflorescences where only half of the flowers were pollinated. Perhaps the greatest contributor to variance in seed size in this species was the temporal decline within plants through the flowering season. These results indicate that maternal plants are not capable of producing uniform seed crops. Rather, the final distribution of seed size produced by plants within a population will necessarily vary and be the result of pollination effects, heterogeneity in the abiotic environment, and developmental constraints. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Flower size; Hydrophyllum appendiculatum; Maternal effects; Pollen donor effects; Seed size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028974588

We hypothesized that bulbil formation was inversely related to fruiting success in the flowering stalk, and we explored this hypothesis in A. macroacantha, a species from South-Central Mexico. Forty randomly chosen plants were divided amongst three treatments: (a) elimination of all floral buds, (b) exclusion of pollinators, and (c) control. We also studied 22 plants in which the flowering stalk had been felled by goat grazing. Between September and November 1991 we kept a record of the numbers of bulbils and capsules produced in each flowering stalk. Significant (P<0.0001) differences between treatments were found in the proportion of plants hearing capsules and bearing bulbils. The control treatment had the highest proportion of plants producing capsules, treatment a had the highest proportion of individuals bearing bulbils, while treatment b showed an intermediate response. In the goat-grazed group, 45% of the plants failed to produce any propagative structure after the stalk was cut, and half of all plants produced bulbils on the remaining stump. A significant inverse relationship between the numbers of capsules and the numbers of bulbils per plant was found for the three randomly assigned treatments. Our results suggest that once the production of the flowering stalk has been triggered and the death of the rosette is irreversible, bulbils may act as an insurance mechanism that increases the probability of successful reproduction of the genet. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Agave; Semelparity; Vegetative reproduction Bulbil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028974584

Our system avoids the need for complicated regeneration procedures thus making it broadly applicable. Naked plasmid DNA encoding kanamycin resistance and GUS activity was introduced by particle gun bombardment into mature pollen grains of Nicotiana glutinosa. Bombarded pollen was used for pollinations and the resulting seeds were selected for kanamycin resistance. Two different kanamycin-resistant plants, designated VIP A and VIP B, were obtained in two independent experiments. In VIP A, TR2?-driven GUS activity was observed in vascular bundles, trichomes and in a small number of pollen grains. DNA gel blot analysis indicated that the introduced DNA was integrated independently into the genome of VIP A and VIP B. It was shown that male and female gametophyte development and seed set were highly aberrant in both VIP A and VIP B and that the offspring of self- and cross-pollinations did not contain the transgenes. This might be caused by a recombination event during the integration of the naked DNA resulting in a deletion of part of the target chromosome. After meiosis such a deletion is lethal for the gametes. Our observation that the transgenes were detected in DNA isolated from sporophytic tissues but not in DNA from VIP A and VIP B pollen grains is in line with this explanation. Future experiments designed to increase the frequency of transformation and to transfer the transgenes to the offspring are discussed. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.",inheritance; integration; Nicotiana glutinosa; particle gun; pollen transformation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029142087

Seventeen OP populations and 2 inbreds of contrasting daylength response [termed by convention as long (LD) and short (SD) day], 1 shallot (A. cepa var. ascalonicum), and one cultivar of bunching onion (Allium fistulosum) were examined with 104 cDNA clones and two to four restriction enzymes. Sixty (58%) clones detected at least 1 polymorphic fragment scorable among the OP populations and were used for analyses. The average number of polymorphic fragments per polymorphic probe-enzyme combination was 1.9, reflecting that numerous monomorphic fragments were usually present. Similarities were estimated as the proportion of polymorphic fragments shared by 2 populations. Average similarity values among LD, among SD, and between LD and SD OP populations were 0.79, 0.67, and 0.68, respectively. Relationships among the OP populations were estimated by parsimony, cluster analysis of similarities using the unweighted-pair-group method (UPGMA), and multivariate analysis using principle components. Parsimony analysis generated a strict consensus tree that grouped all but 1 LD onion with unresolved relationships to the SD OP populations. The UPGMA analysis placed together the LD storage OP populations. Principal component analysis grouped all but 2 LD onions; the other OP populations were dispersed. The results suggest that LD and SD onions do not represent distinct germ plasm, but that LD storage onions represent a derived group selected for production at higher latitudes. If it is assumed that the sampled populations are representative of all onion OP populations, the lower similarities among SD OP populations indicate that their collection and maintenance in germ plasm collections is important for the preservation of genetic diversity. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Allium cepa; Day-length response Parsimony; Phylogenies; Restriction fragment length polymorphisms,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029159147

It had the same effect as colchicine and propham: the cytoplasm, including the generative cell, was no longer concentrated in the tip but was distributed randomly. In addition, ultrastructural investigations have shown that even the vesicle zone, usually found at the very tip of pollen tubes, had disappeared in some tubes. Nonetheless, in vitro growth was not inhibited by more than 20% over a period of 22 h. In contrast, tube growth in plants ceased 1 cm down in the style when carbetamide was applied to the stigma before pollination. At the lowest concentration causing this effect, microtubules of the vegetative cell had disappeared and the cytoplasm was distributed randomly, as it was for in vitro grown tubes. It can be concluded that microtubules of the vegetative cell are essential for pollen tube growth in the style. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Carbetamide; Herbicide; Microtubules; Nicotiana sylvestris; Pollen tubes; Style growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000809537

The genetic interaction between two dominant, nonallelic loci that impart extreme phenotypes for hair density in upland cotton was investigated The gene T1 imparts dense pubescence on leaves and stems and places hairs on the capsule T2(arm) reduces hairs to the margins of the leaves (glabrous plant phenotype). An inheritance model based on interaction between T1 and T2(arm) was devised. This model predicts the frequencies of phenotypes for leaf trichome density in progeny from self pollinated T1t1 T2(arm)t2 plants to be 3 glabrous, 3 normally pubescent, and 10 densely pubescent Furthermore, novel genotypes and phenotypes such as T1t1 T2(arm)T2(arm) plants with a 'normally pubes cent' phenotype and densely pubescent plants with hairless capsules were predicted An F2, a BC1 population (t1t1 T2(arm)T2(arm) x F1), and F2- derived F3 lines were used to test the model. No significant deviations from expected ratios were found, and all predictions were met. Therefore, T1 is epistatic en T2(arm) when phenotypic classes are limited to the presence and absence of trichomes on the leaves or when T1 is homozygous and T2(arm) is heterozygous. In all other situations, T2(arm) is epistatic on T1. These results revise an earlier inheritance model for the inter action of T1 and T2(arm).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028854973

Many floral traits of animal-pollinated angiosperms encourage cross-fertilization3, as recognized by Darwin4-6; however, these characteristics may also allow pollination between flowers on the same individual (geitonogamous self-pollination)7, 8. Simultaneous display of many flowers exemplifies this conflict. Although large floral displays promote outcrossing through enhanced pollinator attraction9, they could be costly in terms of lost mating opportunities10, 11 if geitonogamy decreased outcrossed siring success by reducing pollen transfer between plants (pollen discounting12). We report here that, after manipulating the flower number of bee-pollinated Eichhornia paniculata plants, we observed the predicted higher selfing and lower outcrossed siring success for larger inflorescences. Given the reduced fitness resulting when pollen receipt by one flower interferes with pollen export by another, we propose broadening traditional interpretations of floral design and display to recognize their roles in reducing geitonogamous pollen discounting. © 1995, Nature Publishing Group.

Assessment of these lines in statutory trials prior to their release as cultivars is necessary, owing to concern over the likelihood of transgene escape from such crops. Here, we examine the movement of airborne pollen grains from oilseed rape fields and assess their capacity for long-range geneflow. Pollen dispersal from isolated rape fields was monitored over two seasons and related to the distribution of fields and 'feral' (domesticated plants growing outside cultivations) populations of the crop in Tayside and North East Fife regions of Scotland. Airborne pollen density declined with distance and at 360 m was 10% of that at the field margin. Pollen counts of 0-22 pollen grains m3 were observed 1.5 km from source fields and apparently were sufficient in number to allow seed set on emasculated bait plants. Oilseed rape pollen has greater capacity for long-range dispersal than had been suggested by small-scale field trials. Mean separation of oilseed rape fields in the survey area was 410 m and the mean distance from 'feral' populations to commercial fields was 700 m. Sixty percent of 'feral' populations with more than 10 plants occurred downwind and within 2 km of an oilseed rape field. Provided that the flowering biology of genetically-modified oilseed rape does not differ from the conventional crop, these data suggest that transgene movement to non genetically-modified fields or 'feral' populations is likely following commercial release. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",feral populations; gene flow; genetically modified oilseed rape; pollen movement; risk assessment; transgene; wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250605279

Identification of the cytoplasm of a single plant takes from 4 to 8 years and is complicated by the segregation of a nuclear gene that restores fertility. Although CMS in onion may be due to an incompatibility between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, Southern analyses of DNA from individual plants from crosses of S- and N-cytoplasmic plants supported maternal inheritance of the chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA and, therefore, polymorphisms in the chloroplast DNA may be used to classify cytoplasms. Amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of a fragment that carries an autapomorphic 100-bp insertion in the chloroplast DNA of N-cytoplasm offers a significantly quicker and cheaper alternative to crossing or Southern analysis. Molecular characterization of N- and S-cytoplasms and frequencies of the nuclear non-restoring allele allow onion breeders to determine the proportion of plants in open-pollinated populations that maintain CMS and can significantly reduce the investment required to identify individual maintainer plants. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Allium cepa; Alliumx proliferum Chloroplast DNA; Cytoplasmic male sterility Mitochondrial DNA; Organellar transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029155201

Fluorometric assay of ?-glucuronidase activity indicated different expression patterns for the two promoters. In seedlings, the CaMV 35S promoter had maximum activity in the primary roots, while the mas promoter was most active in the cotyledons. Etiolated seedlings cultured in the dark showed reduced activity of the mas promoter. Before vernalization at the rosette stage, both promoters were more active in older plant parts than in younger ones. At this stage the highest activity was recorded in cotyledons.

Because of the diversity of genes that have now become available for modifying crop plants, it is agreed internationally that there should be a risk assessment before transgenic plants are grown outside the laboratory or glasshouse. Various aspects are considered in a risk assessment including any non-target effects of the transgene, changes in plant persistence and invasiveness, and the possibility of movement of the transgenes to wild populations by cross pollination. It is generally argued that the need for risk assessment and regulation should be determined by an analysis of certain products of transformation, rather than a risk assessment being required for all plants modified by the process of transformation. A possible consequence of considering the product only, however, could be that some of the products of conventional breeding may need to be assessed by the risk assessment procedures developed for transgenic plants. There are discussions with interest groups on the use of transgenic plants in the environment and in food products. It is likely that some form of labelling will be required for certain foods containing ethically-sensitive genes.

Selection should strongly favour wasps that avoid female figs and enter only male figs. Consequently, fig trees would not be pollinated and fig seed production would ultimately cease, leading to extinction of both wasp and fig. We experimentally presented pollinators in the wild (southern India) with a choice between male and female figs of a dioecious fig species, Ficus hispida L. Our results show that wasps do not systematically discriminate between sexes of F. hispida. We propose four hypotheses to explain why wasp choice has not evolved, and how a mutualism is thus maintained in which all wasps that pollinate female figs have zero fitness.

The analysis is limited to the simplest case of a self?incompatible species, in which self pollen does not interfere with seed set. Plants can manipulate the number of flowers visited per pollinator approach by adjusting attractiveness of flowers so as to maximize pollen export (male fitness). In the model the length of the visitation sequence that is optimal for the plant f? always decreases with pollen deposition rate k1, pollen uptake rate k2, and the number of pollinator approaches to the plant X, but increases with the total number of flowers F. We assume that the average number of pollinator approaches X increases with the total number of flowers F, but slower than proportionality. It then follows that the optimal fraction of flowers a pollinator visits after arriving on the plant (f?/F) decreases with the total number of flowers F. Furthermore, the male fitness gain per flower generally decreases with number of flowers, except for the condition of inefficient pollen transfer with very small values of k1, k2, and X, or when the plant has only a few flowers. The latter conditions should favour high nectar production and mass blooming. The known range of parameters suggests that male fitness increases with the total number of flowers slower than proportionality. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Gentiana cruciata was fully self?compatible, but spontaneous self?pollination resulted in severe pollen limitation: natural pollination showed lower reproductive success as compared to hand?pollinations. In addition, reproductive success in the small population was significantly lower through all pollination treatments. Natural pollination was carried out mainly by the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum visiting the flowers for nectar, which was available at all floral stages but in greatest quantities during the morning hours. The number of visitors and visits to the flowers was generally high. However, the constancy of bumblebee visitors (measured as the proportion of heterospecific pollen found on bumblebees) decreased strongly in the afternoon, when nectar standing crop was relatively low. The number of visits and visitors to the G. cruciata flowers remained still very high, but the average time spent per flower decreased significantly. We argue that, in general, the low reproductive success through natural pollination is caused by pollen limitation as a consequence of competition through heterospecific pollen (mainly of the abundantly co?flowering shrub Rubus caesius) transferred and deposited on the stigmas by the bumblebees. The overall lower reproductive potential of the small population may be the result of a combination of poor site quality, rabbit grazing, and inbreeding. 1995 Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",breeding system; competition for pollination; conservation biology; heterospecific pollen; population size; seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993688

Treatments consisted of plants caged to exclude all pollinators, plants caged (cages were 40 × 20 × 2 m) with a shelter containing 30 000 leafcutter bees, and plants exposed to all pollinators present, including honey bees, bumble bees and leafcutter bees. The arrowleaf, berseem and crimson clovers were essentially self-sterile and produced very little seed when bees were excluded, whereas about one-third of the Persian clover flowers were self-pollinated. Only for crimson clover was there a significant difference in the percentage seed set between plants caged with leafcutter bees (50.5 ± 2.5%) and those exposed to resident pollinators (70.4 ± 1.1 %). However, the seed yield of plants caged with leafcutter bees was significantly lower than for open-pollinated plants for all clover species except berseem. The lower seed yields from caged plants may have been due to a cage effect reducing leafcutter bee foraging activity. The results, however, show that M. rotundata is an effective pollinator of these annual clovers, thus increasing the options available to seed growers and beekeepers regarding choice of pollinator.

It has been found that after pollination the number of Ca2+ sequestered in the stigmal exudate and in the sporoderm of the pollen grain gets lower. That phenomenon was associated with the appearance of a large number of Sb/Ca precipitates in the submembrane cytoplasm of the germinating pollen. In the vacuolized pollen grain, i.e. grown into a pollen tube, there were only a few precipitates. In the pollen tube, Ca2+ were found in the organelles of the tip cytoplasm and in the external pectin cell wall. Studies with the use of 45Ca2+ have revealed that the source of calcium ions incorporated into the pollen tube tip and its pectin wall is the transmitting tract of the style. In the transmitting tract overgrown with pollen tubes, Ca2+ were localized in the intercellular matrix and in the transmitting cells. Sb/Ca precipitates occurred in the nuclei, around the secretory vesicles and on the plasmalemma in the transverse walls region. Elevated Ca2+ level was found in degenerating cells (inhibited pollen tubes, transmitting cells, nucellar cells).

Bird activity is greatest where flowering aloes are most dense. Also fruit set is lower in those aloes that bloom later in the season after most of the population has already flowered. Thus the reproductive fitness of aloes is dependent on the density of flowering plants and there is selection for limited seed dispersal. As a result, spatial distributions show clumping in young populations. These clumps act as nuclei from which plants spread slowly over time with mature individuals forming the centres of the densest stands. As a further consequence of limited seed dispersal, intraspecific competition is intense, resulting in self?thinning of the population. The height of A. candelabrum does not enhance pollinator attraction. In closed environments, aloe height serves only to allow the persistence of those plants that establish before the development of a tree canopy. Under the constraint of limited seed dispersal capabilities, selected for by pollinator activity, the height of A. candelabrum serves as an adaptation to spread seeds away from the parent plant and from each other. Variability in seed morphology enhances the latter effect. Des expériences sur l'exclusion des pollinisateurs ont montré que la pollinisation par les insectes est négligeable chez Aloe candelabrum Berger et que les oiseaux sont les seuls pollinisateurs réellement efficaces. L'activité des oiseaux est maximale quand la floraison des aloès est la plus intense, et la fructification est plus faible chez les aloès qui fleurissent plus tard dans la saison, lorsque la plus grande partie de la population a déjà fleuri. Donc, l'aptitude reproductrice des aloès dépend de la densité des plantes en fleurs et il y a une sélection dans la dispersion limitée des semences. Par conséquent, la distribution spatiale présente des agglomérats de jeunes populations. Ces groupes forment un noyau à partir duquel les plants se répandent lentement au cours du temps, avec des individus adultes qui forment le centre des peuplements les plus denses. Conséquence ultérieure d'une dispersion limitée des semences, la compétition intraspécifique est intense et aboutit à un affaiblissement de la popuation. La hauteur de A. candelabrum n'augmente pas l'attraction sur les pollinisateurs. Dans des environnements fermés, la hauteur des aloès sert seulement à permettre le maintien des plantes qui s'installent avant le développement d'une canopée. Face aux contraintes d'une dispersion limitée des semences, déterminée par l'activité des pollinisateurs, la hauteur d' A. candelabrum est une sorte d'adaptation pour disperser les semences loin de la plante mère et des autres plantes. La variabilité de la morphologie des semences accentue ce dernier effet. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Disa cooperi is a robust grassland orchid with long?spud white flowers which are strongly scented in the evening. Observations at a site in Natal province, South Africa showed that hawkmoths are frequent visitors to the orchid at dusk. The hawkmoth Basiothia schenki was an effective pollinator of D. cooperi; this hawk?moth has a medium length proboscis (x = 4.3 cm) which can be fully inserted into the nectar?containing spur of the orchid. Pollinaria are attached ventrally to the basal portion of the proboscis where it joins the head. Another hawkmoth, Agrius convolvuli, commonly foraged on nectar from D. cooperi, but did not carry pollinaria, probably because its proboscis is too long (x = 10 cm) to allow contact between the thick basal portion of the proboscis and the orchid column. Lips in Disa are typically linear and do not produce scent, thus the autapomorphic spathulate and scent?producing lip of D. cooperi indicates that hawkmoth pollination is derived in this species, probably from a long?proboscid fly pollinated ancestor.

The changes in color and reward were recognized by the pollinators and affected their foraging behavior. Pollinators preferred pre-change flowers and avoided post-change ones, thus increasing the chance that white phase flowers would be pollinated.

The flowering period of the population was six months. Nectar was produced continuously and thus the flowers serve as a reliable reward for visiting insects. The number of flowers and fruits produced was related not only to individual plant size but also to environmental patterns of each microhabitat. M. nitens was visited and pollinated mainly by various solitary bees of the genera Anthophora, Eucera, Chalicodoma and Amegilla with long tongues. Smaller-sized solitary bees with short tongues also reached the nectaries by crawling into the flower tube. Nectar provides the main reward for most pollinators. Later in the season female bees began to also collect pollen while sucking nectar. Depending on weather conditions and due to the diurnal cycle of the plants, nectar production varied considerably and directly influenced bee foraging activity. Values for nectar production rate were lower than for nectar standing crop, probably linked with the physiology of flowers, whose nectar production may be stimulated and augmented after withdrawal of nectar by bees. Temperature, relative humidity, and nectar supply apparently determined bee visitation rate. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028881375

The tropical orchid Dendrobium monophyllum F. Muell., an epiphyte or lithophyte, offers no nectar rewards, is self?incompatible and has a capsule?to?flower ratio of about 1:14. The influence of pollination limitation and the costs of capsule production on capsule?to?flower ratios were assessed using experimental and field studies in which individual plants were observed for 3 years. Pollinators visited about 80% of flowers, and capsule production was significantly related to inflorescence size and pollinaria removal. About nine pollinator visits occurred per capsule. Pollinator visitation and capsule production did not vary significantly between years. The inflorescence size classes most successful in capsule production were also the most frequent in natural populations. The experimental supplementation of outcross pollen to flowers increased capsule set over controls by 45% within a year, but was limited to about 53%. A capsule?to?flower ratio of 1:2 in experimental plants significantly decreased the subsequent growth and flowering of individuals relative to controls. A capsule?to?flower ratio above 1:10 in naturally pollinated plants decreased flowering in the subsequent year. Thus, it is suggested than an increase in capsule production above 10% would not necessarily correlate with greater reproductive fitness because of the increased cost of capsule production. The capsule?to?flower ratio recorded in this study could be evolutionarily stable because of trade?offs between selection for pollinator attraction and the cost of capsule production. The production of surplus flowers appears to function in pollinator attraction and increases fitness through male function. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The species is both protogynous and pre-zygotically self-sterile (self-incompatible). Protogyny prevents autopollination (autogamous self-pollination), and self-incompatibility avoids geitonogamous self-fertilisation. This sequence is essential because prior selfing blocks the style with pollen tubes and prevents subsequent outcrossing. Flowers have no discernible daytime odour, the pollen is clumped and not easily shaken from opened anthers, and daytime insect visitors are rarely observed in the field. However in long-established populations, mast plants carry one or a few capsules during winter-spring and seeds per capsule are generally high. Reproduction of natural populations involves reliable pollinators of unknown identity, possibly small flies, bees or moths lured by a tiny amount of sucrose-rich nectar secreted by the hypogynous disc. It is not anomalous that A. gracilis has two devices for preventing self-fertilisation, protogyny and strong self-incompatibility, as both are functional aspects of the same outcrossing system. This is the first report of self-incompatibility in the Anthocercideae which is an old and apparently basal lineage in the Solanaceae. © 1995 CSIRO.

The species co?occurred with the grass Molinia caerulea and co?flowered with Erica tetralix and Calluna vulgaris. The flowering period lasted from July to October, peaking in late August to late September. Flowers are protandrous. The species appeared to be self?compatible, but spontaneous self?pollination was strongly limited. Hand?crossing and hand?selfing resulted in the same amount of seed set as in natural pollination. Reproductive success was dramatically reduced late in the season. Pollination was achieved sternotribically by the species Bombus pascuorum, which visited the flowers for nectar. In the study area, three patch types were distinguished: co?dominated by Erica, by Calluna and Erica, and by Molinia, respectively. Frequency of visits to Gentiana was highest in the Erica?patch. However, this did not result in a higher seed set. In the Molinia?patch seed set was reduced. However, in the Molinia?patch the mean number of ovules was greater than in the others (as high as in plants raised indoors and in cross?pollinated plants). Fruits from the Calluna?patch had less ovules than those from the Erica?patch. We conclude that, in this remnant population, Gentiana is not pollination?limited. However, it is likely that in the Molinia?patch geitonogamy is frequent, which may lead to inbreeding depression. The greater number of ovules observed in Molinia?patches may reflect an excess of nutrients available there, relative to the Calluna?patch where there may be reduced water availability.

Following pollination however, there is a rapid acceleration of the wilting process, which is completed within 2 days. The first event detected following pollination was an increase in ethylene sensitivity. This increased sensitivity began about 4 h after pollination and peaked 6 h later. A subsequent increase in ethylene production could only be detected 12 to 14 h after pollination. Treatment of the flowers with silver thiosulfate or 1?methylcyclopropene, both inhibitors of ethylene action, completely inhibited the pollination?induced increase in ethylene production and the enhanced senescence of the flowers. This indicates that the pollination?induced increase in ethylene production is a response to the existing ethylene. Treatment of flowers with calcium and its ionophore A23187, which increased ethylene sensitivity and protein phosphorylation, also promoted ethylene production and senescence of unpollinated flowers, EGTA, a calcium chelator, decreased the sensitivity of pollinated flowers to ethylene and delayed and decreased the pollination?induced increase in ethylene production. We suggest that the pollination?induced increase in ethylene sensitivity is the initial pollination?induced event triggering the enhancement of ethylene production, which leads to enhanced senescence of Phalaenopsis flowers.

Plants are either short? (S) or long?styled (1). In Israel, marsh populations are dominated by S plants and hill populations by L plants. Populations differ in size, flowering time and duration, flower orientation, inflorescence display, vegetative reproduction, and pollinators. The main visitors to flowers in marshes are hawkmoths, whereas in the hills they are visited by short?tongued insects: solitary bees and hoverflies. The pollination efficiency of these insects was investigated by studying foraging behaviour, visit rate, and pollen deposition on stigmas. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of lower efficiency of pollination of S flowers by short?tongued insects, resulting in the exclusion of this morph from the hills. Additionally, we considered the possibility that there might be pollination ecotypes corresponding to the two habitats (marsh and hill) and examined variation in a set of continuous flower traits related to pollination biology. Flower tube length was the only trait showing a distinct difference between the two habitat types. Although the concentration of nectar was not different between habitats, L flowers presented more concentrated nectar than S flowers. Such a difference in nectar concentration may he of adaptive value for the pollination of the L flowers by short?tongued pollinators in the hills. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The ""plant-pollinator landscape' is shaped by an interacting set of plant and pollinator attributes: flowering phenology sets the distance that pollinators need to travel between patches of a given species to obtain sufficient food, while the pollinators' search capacities and dietary specificity determines the likelihood that they can and will make that journey. These sets of traits do not vary independently, allowing us to identify several characteristic landscapes and the types of organisms that occupy them. This chapter describes five such landscapes, attempting in each case to determine whether phenological variation within plant species helps to explain the ability of pollinators to persist. The first two landscapes are occupied by highly specialized pollinators and (respectively) synchronously flowering and asynchronously flowering plants. Intraspecific phenological variation is likely to have critical consequences for pollinator persistence in these two landscapes. The third and fourth landscapes are occupied by relatively generalized pollinators and (respectively) synchronously flowering and asynchronously flowering plants. The former is probably the most common landscape, encompassing most temperate plant-pollinator interactions. Pollinators in these landscapes are less likely to be strongly influenced by phenological variation in any one of their resource plants, due to their ability to switch foods easily while remaining local. The fifth landscape is occupied by generalist pollinators that may migrate. Little is known about resource use of individual migrants, but it is possible that at least some of them rely on geographical gradients in flowering time of certain preferred species. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028794872

The number of male, bisexual and female flowers on each short shoot was 22.6, 2.2 and 3.3 flowers on average, respectively. The number of flowers per short shoot and the sex ratio differed according to individual trees and to the positions of the tree crown. The number of stamens and the number of pollen grains contained in each anther were greater in male flowers than in bisexual flowers. It was estimated that the number of pollen grains per short shoot was 746,900 grains. Although flowering time differed among individual trees, the flowering of female flowers started earlier than that of male flowers. The flowering period of each tree was about eight days. The pollen dispersal started when the maximum temperature increased more than 15°C and most pollen grains were dispersed when air temperature increased and relative humidity decreased. The maximum number of fallen pollen grains per day was 1,206 grains/cm2 and the total number during flowering period was 3,190 grains/cm2. Pollen grains germinated on the hair of the stigma in such a way that the pollen tubes coiled round the hair, spiraled down and penetrated into the tissue of the stigma.

Pollination of White Sim flowers with Starlight pollen elicited an increase in ethylene pro-duction by styles, leading to increased petal ethylene and premature petal senescence. In contrast, pollination with 87-29C pollen led to an early increase in ethylene production, but this was not sustained, and did not lead to petal senescence. Both Starlight and 87-29G pollen germinated on White Sim stigmas and their tubes grew at similar rates, penetrating the length of the style. Crosses between Starlight and White Sim led to the production of viable seeds, whereas 87-29G pollen was infertile on White Sim flowers. Pollination of other carnations with 87-29G elicited ethylene production and petal senescence and led to the production of viable seeds. These results suggest that physical growth of pollen tubes is insufficient to elicit a sustained increase in ethylene production or to lead to the production of signals necessary for elicitation of petal ethylene production and senescence. Rather, the cell-cell recognition reactions leading to sexual compatibility in Dianthus appear to play a role in this interorgan signaling after pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028813566

My studies on the amount of pollen removed from androecia and deposited on stigmas in single visits by bumblebees did not confirm this supposition. Trimming off parts of the floral vestibule with scissors and gluing in pleats had very little effect on the amount of pollen that bees moved. In reciprocal transfer experiments, flowers from different populations sometimes differed in the amount of pollen moved, but when the two species were compared in sympatry, pollen removal and deposition differed hardly at all. A comparison of the relationship between pollen movement and floral morphology among 15 populations showed that, although there was great heterogeneity in the amount of pollen moved, the observed differences were independent of floral morphology. None of this supports a belief in strong selection that fine-tunes the mechanical fit between bee and flower; selection for visitation success based on pollinator behaviour may have a much stronger influence on floral characters. © 1995 The Linnean Society of London.",Bombus; floral; morphology; pollen deposition; pollen removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149210643

Pollination could be one of these processes, because pollinator activity and efficiency are negatively affected by cold or wet weather. From 1990 to 1992 at the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility in Wageningen, The Netherlands, field and glasshouse experiments were performed to study the importance of pollination for caraway seed yields and the effects of some environmental factors. Preventing insect pollination by placing gauze cages in field plots reduced the yield of caraway by c. 15-20%, but under normal field conditions > 90% of hermaphrodite flowers were fertilized and additional hand-pollination did not improve yield. Removal of competing umbels enhanced the low seed set percentages in higher-order umbels, indicating that pollination did not limit seed yield in these umbels. Assays suggested that wind transfer, in addition to insects, plays a role in the pollination of caraway. It was concluded that assimilate availability and not pollination limits caraway seed yield. © 1995, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029135903

Visual signals of these two Oenothera species were the same, with a strong UV?absorbent spot in the center of the corollas. Large nocturnal hawkmoth species such as Theretra japonica, Agrius convolvuli, and Deilephila elphenor lewisil are major pollinators for these two Oenothera species.

The material consisted of 33 progeny tests located in northern Finland within the original areas of the clones. Although no clear difference was observed between the height growth of the two groups, the survival was significantly lower in the seed orchard material (35%) than in the local stand material (56%). The relative survival (seed orchard vs. local entries) decreased steadily along with the decrease in the effective temperature sum of the trial sites, and was relatively small in the northernmost trials. The results indicate that the totally background pollinated seed from southwards-transferred, young seed orchards even can be used for reforestation in southern and central Lapland, at least in areas located at relatively low altitudes. The decrease in background pollination levels owing to the ageing of these orchards will increase the potential use of this seed. Using only those orchards containing the northernmost clones, combined with selective harvesting of the most hardy portion of the clones, is proposed as a means of further improving the adaptedness of planting material for northern conditions. © 1995.",Adaptation; Climatic hardiness; Pinus sylvestris; Provenance hybrid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028829953

Because of the financial yield, more and more trees are being planted each year. The cashew tree flowers once a year between January and March, but pollination is mostly entomophilous. Objective: For the first time, a study was conducted to establish the possible role of the cashew pollen in triggering allergic asthma. Methods: A stock solution of pollen extract was prepared with the standard weight/volume method for intradermal skin tests and a bronchial provocation tests (BPTs). The protein content of the antigen, estimated with the use of Folin phenol reagent and a spectrophotometer, was 28.72 mg/ml. Ten healthy volunteers and 65 subjects with allergic asthma, as documented by previous positive skin test reactions to various pollens, were studied. Results: Of the 65 patients, 26 (40%) had positive skin test reactions in various grades. BPTs were performed in 22 of the 26 patients after their baseline peak expiratory flow volume was assessed. Twenty (90.9%) patients had a positive BPT result, and the majority of patients had grade III and grade IV reactions. None of the control subjects (n = 10) had positive responses to either intradermal tests or the BPT. Serum IgE levels, estimated by ELISA, were high in patients with positive skin test responses and showed a linear correlation with cutaneous sensitivity. Control subjects showed normal levels of IgE (39.0 ± 7.87 IU/ml). Conclusions: This study provided us with knowledge of an additional pollen, Anacardium occidentale, which could trigger an asthmatic response in allergic individuals.

Flies provide a service ecologically anologous to pollination. The author documents similarities with insect pollination systems in general that include primary dependence by Epichloe on animal vectors, a color change of the fruiting structure following cross-fertilization, rewards provided to animal vectors, and exploitation by third party species that use rewards offered by the fungus but provide no payment for the rewards. The fungus-insect interaction shows several similarities with coevolved pollinating parasite systems. 1) The interaction contains a mix of mutualism and parasitism with the net effect being positive for both partners. 2) Flies desplay a specific behavior that ensures cross-fertilization of Epichloe. 3) The interaction is symbiotic and appears species specific and obligate for the interactants. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029520122

The ovules of flowers at three positions within the inflorescence were excised on the day after they had opened. The ovules exposed to the lower temperatures tended to be smaller and less advanced in development, even when otherwise normal, especially on Chardonnay, and the ovules of king flowers tended to be larger than those of the other flowers. Over half of the ovules of Chardonnay exposed to the low temperatures were abnormal (with abnormal or no embryo sacs, and some also having a degenerated nucellus) while 35% of the Shiraz ovules were without normal embryo sacs. To study pollination and pollen tube growth, vines similar to those of the ovule study were exposed to 12°/9°C two days before or on the day of flowering. In the pistils exposed to low temperature, a reduction occurred in the number of pollen tubes present in the lower ovary on days 2 and 4 after flowering, from about four to almost nil in Chardonnay, but a smaller reduction occurred in Shiraz. In the absence of cool temperatures, pollen tubes penetrated on average less than one ovule per ovary in Chardonnay and about one ovule per ovary in Shiraz. It is concluded that temperature sensitivity to fruit?set is a varietal characteristic, expressing itself in quantitative differences in the damage imparted to the structure of the ovules and the function of the pollen.

O2 encodes a b2IP transcription factor, which is capable of activating its target promoters, 22kD ?-zein and b-32, in a number of experimental systems. Storage protein accumulation, and storage protein promoter activity, are modulated according to available levels of nitrogen (N). In barley, nitrogen regulation is mediated by the endosperm box via interaction of the endosperm and GCN 4 motifs. The nitrogen- responsive components of the 22kd zein promoter have been shown to include the O2-binding sites Z1Z3 but to display N-responsiveness even in the absence of O2 protein. © 1995, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

In this paper we present natural population data on the floral biology and reproductive ecology of the endemic Mediterranean species Cyclamen balearicum Willk. This is a long?lived, diploid perennial herb which occurs in southern France in five fragmented and isolated regions and on the Balearic Islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Cabrera and Draponera. Our observations indicate a particularly scarce pollinator activity (rare syrphid visits) and dispersal by ants over small distances. A controlled pollination experiment in a natural population showed that in southern France C. balearicum is fully self?compatible and that selfing is autonomous and probably delayed (i.e. following opportunities for outcrossing). The proximity of stigmas and anthers will favour autonomous selfing. The high pollen/ovule ratio indicates nevertheless that C. balearicum has a mixed mating system. Patterns of variation in stigma?anther separation and pollen production per flower suggest that not only has the current mating system of the species evolved from an outcrossing ancestor but that due to the fragmentation and isolation of populations greater levels of selfing have evolved in southern France (and to an intermediate degree on Ibiza and Menorca). On the island of Mallorca where larger continuous belts of C. balearicum habitat still exist the species has floral traits indicating a more outcrossed mating system. To our knowledge this is the first paper to document such trends in floral traits in the endemic component of the Mediterranean flora. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Muell. Levels of outcrossing ((t) over cap) varied significantly between populations from mixed mating with substantial selfing ((t) over cap = 0.54) to almost completely outcrossed ((t) over cap = 0.95). Comparison of single-locus and multilocus estimates suggested that the drop in outcrossing was due to increased self-pollination. The lowest outcrossing rate was attributed to the reduced ability of a population with low numbers of buds to attract bird pollinators. Outcrossing rates in E. rameliana are proposed to be a more direct reflection of pollination than estimates made for mass flowering, i.e. small-fruited eucalypts. The distribution of allozyme diversity in E. rameliana also appeared to reflect the impact of bird pollinators in promoting gene flow as well as the species capacity for outcrossing and introgression. Levels of diversity were comparable with other eucalypts, but the proportion of diversity between populations (GST = 9.2%) was only about half the mean for other eucalypts. Genetic distances between populations were low, but there was same significant differentiation of populations which was attributed to non-random bird migrations. The importance of bird pollination in the mating system and the distribution of genetic diversity in E. rameliana emphasises that enough habitat to support nomadic birds should be preserved in order to conserve this eucalypt species. © 1995 CSIRO.

This syndrome is common in species pollinated by bees and flies, and very few exceptions are known. We investigated flowering phenology and pollinator behavior in Besseya bullii (Scrophulariaceae) and found that it did not fit Darwin's syndrome. The vertical inflorescence was acropetalous but the flowers were distinctly protogynous, so flowers with newly receptive stigmas appeared on the inflorescence above those with dehiscing anthers. A number of small insects visited B. bullii; bees in the family Halictidae (Augochlorella striata and Dialictus spp.) were most common. When insects moved between gender phases within inflorescences, they moved up more often than down (61% versus 39% of observations, respectively) but this difference was only marginally significant. Most visits were to male-phase flowers only, and this preference was more pronounced for pollen-foraging insects than for nectar-foraging insects. B. bullii was self-compatible, so its flowering characteristics potentially could result in considerable self-pollination. However, an average of 38% of the lowermost flowers opened before any pollen was available on the same inflorescence; these ""solo females"" had a high probability of outcrossing (though fruit set was relatively low in the bottom portion of the inflorescence). Upper flowers may also be outcrossed because downward insect movement was not uncommon. Therefore protogyny in B. bullii may not necessarily lead to more selfing than would protandry. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Besseya bullii; Foraging behavior; Halictidae; Pollination; Protogyny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028977436

Per cent fruit?set and berry number per bunch of Chardonnay were reduced by about one third to one half by 12°/9°C, applied just before and at the early stage of flowering. At these stages, and with this low?temperature treatment, supplementary pollination had significant positive effects. Total seed number per berry was not affected by treatment, but the proportion of hollow seeds increased in the treatments which suffered reduced set. This resulted in a positive relation between the number of functional seeds per berry and the number of berries per bunch. In Shiraz, the differences between the various treatment means were small and mostly not significant.

Excluding aerial hunters and wading birds, 47 species were recorded from four mangrove forest sites in Selangor, though undoubtedly some rarer species were missed due to the brevity of the study. The estimated density of birds, using fixed?width transects, ranged from 15 to 26 birds per ha. One quarter of all birds counted belonged to just one species, the Ashy Tailorbird Orthotomus ruficeps. Excluding ground feeders (three species), four foraging guilds were recognized among 17 of the commonest bird species: obligate foliage?foraging insectivores (seven species), bark?foraging insectivores (four), facultative nectar?ivores (five) and aerial hawkers (one). Species within the first and third guilds apparently were partitioned by foraging technique and heights, while those of the second guild (woodpeckers) differed mainly in their selection of plant species. The horizontal distribution of several species corresponded to the zonation of mangroves. Avifaunal differences between sites reflected differences in forest floristics. The greatest number of species occurred at the dry landward edge site, which supported seven bird species not encountered elsewhere in Selangor. This habitat has almost completely disappeared from much of the peninsula owing to land reclamation. Four of the six resident mangrove?specialized bird species in Selangor were regularly recorded at two or more sites, another (Greater Gol?denback Woodpecker Chrysocolaptes lucidus) occurred at only one site and the last (Ruddy Kingfisher Halcyon coromanda) was never recorded. Two species of sunbirds probably play an important role in the pollination of several species of mangroves. The colonization of anthropogenic habitats by many mangrove?dwelling bird species is attributed partly to their generalized foraging niches, which may have evolved in response to regular fluctuations in food availability and the dynamic physiography of mangrove communities.

Decisions between long-term and short-term set-aside will influence the future age profile of communities on uncultivated land, affecting their conservation value and their role as sources of pests, natural enemies and pollinators for nearby crops. Because long-term studies of set-aside in Britain are not yet available, other evidence is used to review the successional changes to be expected in a 10 year period of natural regeneration after ploughing. Succession is considered in terms of ecological attributes of plant and insect communities, rather than lists of individual species, so that the concepts are more generally applicable. In a landscape increasingly affected by disturbance, in which some groups of plant and insect species of long-established vegetation are already decreasing, long-term unploughed set-aside offers an opportunity to establish and protect patches of undisturbed perennial herbaceous vegetation and their associated fauna, helping common species to remain common and ecologically important species to remain functional. © 1995.",Conservation; Natural enemies; Perennials; Ploughing; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993505

All seeds tested germinated over a large range of temperatures (5-35°C). However, low temperatures (5-10°C) and temperatures above 30°C reduced germination. Seeds were also sensitive to oxygen deprivation, but their sensitivity to hypoxia depended on the cultivar. The germination responses of seeds to temperature and oxygen depended on their size, particularly at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures. The largest seeds (1. 8-2. 1 mm) of commercial lots usually germinated better at 5°C and were more sensitive to oxygen deprivation than the smallest ones (1. 2-1. 8 mm). Experiments performed with open pollinated plants showed that seeds produced by umbels of first and second orders germinated faster and at higher percentages than those collected on third-order umbels. Evidence for the involvement of pollination conditions in the germination quality of carrot seeds was given by pollination by honey bees of male-sterile plants cultivated at various distances from the pollen donors. The longer the distance of the mother plants from the pollinating plants, the lower the seed yield, the heavier the mean seed weight, the more difficult the germination of seeds, and the higher their sensitivity to oxygen deprivation. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

S. diluvialis exhibe un sistema reproductivo mixto: el grado de autopolinización depende en parte de la abundancia de los polinizadores que visitan las flores. La exocría es promovida por flores protándricas y por movimientos acropetalos de abejas en las inflorecencias. Sin embargo, las fases femenina y masculina se superponen y las flores son totalmente autocompatibles. No se observaron frutos autógamos o agamospermos, lo que indica que se requiere un vector de pólen para la reproducción. Las observaciones indícan que los abejorros (Bombus spp.) son los polinizadores más importantes de S. diluvialis. Los encargados del manejo de tierras, deben incluir a los polinizadores y plantas productoras de polen en sus planes para preserva esta rara orquídea. Se deberían considera los efectos de los programas de manejo de pestes sobre los abejorros y la disponibilidad de hábitat apropiado para el anidamiento de abejas. El manejo debería centrar sus esfuerzos para mantener la diversidad florística, ya que otras especies con flores podrían facilitar la pollinización de S. diluvialis.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028984929

These species are usually polyploid and pseudogamous. Since apomixis is only facultative, the species have retained the possibility to produce some offspring by sexual recombination. Hybridization of restriction?enzyme?digested DNA samples to the M13, (AC)/(TG) and 33.15 probes has yielded valuable information on the occurrence and distribution of genetic variation in Rubus. Intraspecific variation proved to be very restricted, with identical DNA fingerprints sometimes being exhibited by Swedish, Danish and German populations of the same species. By comparison, interspecific variation was usually pronounced, suggesting that most species have been derived through genetic recombination. Speciation through interspecific hybridization was demonstrated in one case. Several critical taxa were investigated; some of these proved to have unique DNA fingerprints, whereas others appear to be identical with previously described species. Evaluation of raspberry cultivars, obtained through several generations of vegetative propagation or with various in vitro techniques, failed to detect any DNA fingerprint variation, suggesting that the fingerprints are somatically stable. Blackberry seedlings, obtained by pollinating various species as well as interspecific hybrids with pollen from yet other species, were successfully evaluated with DNA fingerprinting to determine the relative proportions of the apomictic and sexual seed set.

Don. Differences in the position of fracture within the cell wall among these groups of trees were compared with lignin distribution and cell wall dimensions. In the control trees equivalent to typical New Zealand grown radiata pine, fracture occurred predominantly between the middle lamella and S1 layers as well as within the S1 layer, producing large numbers of fines on the fracture surface. In the open pollinated NZ850-55 group, fracture occurred predominantly between the S1 and S2 layers as well as within the S1 layer, producing fewer fines on the surface. In the NZ850-55 x Guadalupe group, fracture occurred in a similar fashion to the open pollinated group except for a greater number of transwall fractures exposing the cell lumen on the fracture surface. The differences in fracture behaviour between the control and genetically select groups are attributed to reduced lignification at the S1/S2 boundary in the genetically select trees. Observed differences in both the type of fracture and its location were unrelated to cell dimensions.

Specific criteria of these stages allow their easy identification independent of growth conditions and thus provide necessary reference points for any developmental studies. The distribution of mitotic activity followed by cell elongation and endopolyploidisation during seed development suggests a developmental gradient expressed in a specific spatial and temporal pattern at two levels between individual seed organs and within single organs. The accumulation pattern of storage proteins legumin and vicilin and their mRNAs, analysed by immunohistostaining and in situ hybridisation and the pattern of starch accumulation are directly correlated with these gradients, i.e., storage function is related inversely to mitotic activity and directly to cell elongation and endopolyploidisation. All seed organs synthesize storage proteins. Thus the expression of vicilin and legumin genes is not embryo specific but seed specific.

In a study to determine what limits seed production, it is found that the number of seeds formed per capsule in eucalypts through natural open-pollination was low in relation to the number of ovules in the flower. Controlled-pollination generally increased the number of seeds per capsule, indicating that the amount of pollen reaching the stigma under open-pollination may be a limiting factor in seed production. Placing hives in seed production areas increased seed quantity and quality at the same time producing useful amounts of honey.

In apomictic reproduction, an embryo is formed directly from a chromosomally unreduced magaspore mother cell or from a somatic cell of the nucellus or ovule. Apomixis makes vegetative reproduction or cloning through the seed possible. The simple genetic control of apomixis improves the potential for manipulating this reproductive mechanism and transferring it to other species. The best source of the gene(s) controlling apomixis would be within the species targeted for improvement. Phenotypic expression of a gene(s) controlling apomixis is important in both the originating species and in plants of the recipient species, genera, or family if the gene is transferred. Apomixis appears to be qualitatively controlled by a single or, at most, a few genes. Selection of highly apomictic clones in facultative apomictic Kentucky bluegrass has been the basis for improved cultivars in this species. Apomixis provides a unique opportunity to develop and maintain superior gene combinations in cultivars and it would simplify hybrid seed production. It is necessary to determine the reproductive behavior of selected plants in a breeding program involving apomixis. This can be done by progeny testing open-pollinated seed from selected plants. In a breeding program, it must be remembered that obligate apomictic plants can only be used as male parents in crosses. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000790267

With the objective to reveal major components of female fertility, the behavior of 47 outstanding potato dihaploids (S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, 2n=2x=24) was assessed in testcrosses over a period of 3 years. Analysis of variance was carried out for the traits: number of seed per berry (S/B), number of intact seed per berry (IS/B), and number of non-germinable seed per berry (NGS/B). Significant sources of variation included cross combinations, years, and cross combination-year interactions. More than 20 S/B were obtained in 25.4% of all cross combinations performed over 3 years using up to three pollinators. Berry set was not correlated to seed set, but was in general determined by the pollinator used. The number of seedless berries (SLB/F) was related to neither total berry set nor seed production. The trait S/B remained stable over different years, and thus it deemed to be most useful as a measure of the level of female fertility in practical breeding work.

Seed longevity in soil was quantified in a seed burial and retrieval experiment. The importance of annual seed production to recruitment was also determined over a 2-year-period, as was the impact of conspecific neighbour density on seed production per inflorescence. Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides appears to form a transient seed bank with little capacity to store germinable seeds in the soil from year to year. No seedlings were observed in soil sampled after the autumn germination pulse and no viable seed was present in the soil within 16 weeks of burial. The rate of seed loss was similar when seed was buried under all intact grassland canopy and in 0.25m2 canopy gaps. It appears that most seeds simply rot in moist soil or are predated by soil invertebrates. Seedling recruitment was at least 15 times greater in plots where natural seed input occurred than where it was curtailed. Less than 10% of seed shed resulted in seedling emergence. It is suggested that recruitment in the large populations studied was limited by germination rather than by microsite availability for seedling survival. Population density had an impact on seed production with sparsely distributed individuals producing fewer seeds per inflorescence than plants from denser colonies, although there was much variation. Sparse plants produced significantly fewer seeds per inflorescence than hand crosspollinated heads suggesting reduced pollinator efficacy in these colonies relative to larger colonies where there was no such difference. Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides is dependent on the maintenance of the standing population for recruitment. Any factors that influence flowering and subsequent seed production will limit the ability of the species to regenerate. Over sufficient time, this could lead to the localised extinction of the species and may explain why R. leptorrhynchoides has failed to reappear in remnants where a suitable fire regime has been re-implemented after a period of management unfavourable to the survival, flowering and regeneration of this species. © 1995 CSIRO.

Methods: Pollen counts were done with a Burkard spore trap (Burkard Manufacturing, Rickmansworth, Herst., U.K.). The results were subsequently compared with results of skin tests in patients with pollinosis born and living in and around Madrid. Results: The highest airborne presence (percent of total yearly pollen counts, mean of counts from 1979 to 1993) was for Quercus spp. (17%); followed by Platanus spp. (15%), Poaceae (15%), Cupressaceae (11%), Olea spp. (9%), Pinus spp. (7%), Populus spp. (4%), and Plantago spp. (4%). The most predominant pollens from January to April are tree pollens (Cupressaceae, Alnus, Fraxinus, Ulmus, Populus, Platanus, and Morus), although these are also abundant in May and June (Quercus, Olea, and Pinus spp.). The grass pollination period shows a double curve: the first peak occurs from February to April (8% of yearly grasses), and the second peak occurs from May to July (90% of yearly grasses). Among allergenically significant weeds, the most notable is Plantago; in contrast, Rumex, Urticaceae, Cheno-Amaranthaceae, and Artemisia spp. have very low concentrations (?2% yearly total pollens). The most significant allergenic pollen is that of grasses, with a prevalence of positive prick test results of 94%, followed by Olea europaea (61%), Plantago lagopus (53%), Platanus hybrida (52%), and Cupressus arizonica (20%). Conclusion: The population of Madrid is exposed to high concentrations of allergenic pollen from February to July, although the most intense period is from May to June. Grass pollens are the most important cause of pollinosis in this area. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 1995;96:15-23.). © 1995 Mosby, Inc.

Wind patterns and the geographic pattern of pollen shedding were such that it is likely that the origin of the early pollen was hundreds of km to the south. Since many of the female strobili are receptive to pollination before local pollen shedding occurred, early non-local pollen has an advantage over later local pollen.

In the montane herb Ipomopsis aggregata, allozymic variation has previously been examined at the two extremes of geographic and microspatial scales. Here we assessed morphometric and allozymic variation at intermediate scales by sampling from three localities approximately 25 km apart. Within each locality we sampled three populations 2.5 km apart, and within each population we sampled three subpopulations (250 m apart), each of 50 plants. Hierarchical F-statistics based on ten polymorphic allozyme loci revealed significant variation across individuals, subpopulations, populations, and localities. As spatial distance between sampling points increased, genetic distance increased and indirect estimates of gene flow, based on Fst, decreased. Gene flow at the subpopulation and population levels can result from extraterritorial flights made by hummingbird pollinators, whereas gene flow at the locality level is likely to represent movements during hummingbird migration. The scale of differentiation was different for allozymes and floral morphology. For allozymes, variance components decreased monotonically with spatial scale, whereas for morphological characters the variance component among localities was higher than the population variance component. Three hypotheses are proposed to account for the high among-locality variance in floral morphology (1) environmental effects on morphology, (2) genetic differences resulting from locality dependent selection, and (3) introgression from l. tenuituba. © 1995 The American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029133273

Though pollen/ovule ratios of flowers, inflorescences and plants are at a level common for facultative xenogamic systems, controlled pollination shows a marked xenogamy. The ratio between pollen grains in the polyad and the maximum number of seeds per pod is close to one. Observations support the idea of the inflorescence as a specialized reproductive unit with gynoecia functioning as fixed modules in which all or none of its ovules develop into seeds. Mass flowering prior to the growing season, the absence of other floral resources in the community, the high degree of fruiting limitations and scarce insect visitation suggest that, as in other Acacia, the reproductive system of Acacia caven involves a great sacrifice of floral resources.

Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) is self-incompatible with one ovule per flower, so pollen competition at each ovule can be studied. The occurrence of selection among pollen parents was determined, as well as the relative importance of prezygotic and post-zygotic selection. Mixed pollinations from two donors produced nonrandom paternity, with one of the donors being favored about 2:1 on several females. Individual plants showed significant variation in the speed of pollen-tube growth. Therefore, prezygotic selection is likely to have occurred based on the speed of pollen tube growth. In single-donor pollinations, donors had equal success as expected in the absence of post-zygotic selection among donors. However, a significant male x female interaction was found, consistent with postzygotic selection against particular parental combinations. To test whether male fitness is reduced by increased allocation to seed filling during pollen production, large- and small-seeded lines were compared, both as pollen donor and as pollen recipient. The large-seeded line was better in both roles, thus there was no evidence that greater allocation to seeds reduced the quality of the pollen. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",allocation; buckwheat; Fagopyrum esculentum; male reproductive success; pollen grain competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028852876

However, in the case of Olea europaea, the pollen was detected in advance by the sampler located at 1.5 m compared with the one located at 15 m, probably due to the fact that olives growing close to the low sampler flower before the great olive plantations located some 60 km south of the city. No significant differences between the counts of both samplers have been observed, except in the case of Urticaceae, where the sampler situated on top of the building recorded higher pollen concentrations in both years.

Accession DZA 3181.1.1 of M. sphaerocarpos had the highest overall AMV transmission rate. Only two cultivars, cvv. Borung and Hannaford of M. truncatula, and accession SA 4268 of M. orbicularis, had transmission rates of less than 10%. The rates of CMV transmission to seedlings via seed produced on infected plants of the cultivars and accessions tested were 0.3 to 13%, the greatest being found in M. polymorpha cv. Serena, but 6 out of 11 had no detectable transmission. The rates of BYMV transmission to seedlings via seed of the cultivars and accessions tested were 0.3 to 1%, but in 12 out of 15 none was detected. AMV isolate OUI-2 was transmitted to 52% of seedlings via seed produced on healthy M. polymorpha cv. Circle Valley plants pollinated from infected plants. In contrast, no transmission to seedlings by either graft-inoculation or pollination of M. polymorpha plants was detected with a second AMV isolate, OUI-1, which appeared to have lost its ablilty to be seed transmitted. No CMV or BYMV transmission to seedlings via pollination of healthy plants with pollen from infected plants was detected in M. polymorpha cvv. Circle Valley or Santiago. When empty immature pods, and dissected seed coats and embryos from immature seeds produced on AMV-infected plants of M. polymorpha were tested, AMV isolates OUI-I and OUI-2 were detected in all pods and seed coats, but only in 59% of embryos with isolate OUI-2 and in none with isolate OUI-1. CMV was detected in 12% of embryos tested from immature seeds produced on CMV-infected M. polymorpha cv. Serena plants. Transmission of all three viruses through seed, and of AMV through pollen, is cause for concern in annual medic breeding and evaluation programs. Moreover, carry-over outside the growing season in medic pastures is possible through seed with all three viruses. © 1995 CSIRO.

We conducted detailed measurements on 150 marked plants over two years to (1) quantitatively describe the variation in sex expression and elucidate the factors responsible for gender variation in males, (2) determine the role of plant size in regulating the flowering behavior through the year, and (3) document pollinator visitation to males and females. The variability in sex expression differed between males and females. Females only reproduced by seed. In contrast, gender in males was extremely variable: 35% of males reproduced only by pollen donation (pure males) and 65% produced pollen and varying amounts of fruit and seeds (inconstant males). The ability to produce fruit was highly correlated with individual plant size. Inconstant males were significantly larger than pure males. Individual plant size also determined the flowering pattern through the year. Unlike most other desert plant species that typically flower after the winter rains, large O. baccatus plants flowered all year. Small plants, regardless of sex, flowered only during the winter months. The flowers of O. baccatus were visited by a diverse suite of insects including wasps, bees, ants, beetles, flies, and butterflies. Perhaps owing to the greater attractiveness of the floral display of males (due to the presence of yellow pollen), males were visited by many more insects than females. Over four observation days, 526 insects were counted on male plants compared to only 39 on females. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995084

Beginning at 3 days after pollination (DAP) kernels were grown in vitro at 25°C and 24 h later were transferred to 35°C for either 4 or 8 days. Each treatment had a control that was maintained continously at 25°C. Two experiments were designed to examine the uptake and distribution of 14C among hexoses, sucrose and starch in the pedicel placento?chalazal (pedicel/p?c). endosperm, and pericarp tissues of kernels exposed to heat stress for 4 or 8 days. Kernels cultured in vitro were placed in 14C?sucrose medium either during the period of heat stress (experiment 1; 5 to 13 DAP) or immediately following heat?stress treatments (experiment 2; 10 to 22 DAP). In both experiments no significant effect of heat stress was observed on the total radioactivity accumulated in the kernels until about 17 DAP, after which heat?stressed kernels accumulated less 14C than the control. During the linear fill period, the endosperm of kernels exposed to heat stress accumulated more radioactivity associated with hexoses and sucrose and less radioactivity incorporated into starch, as compared to the control. Kernels heat stressed for 4 days showed a partial recovery in starch synthesis by 21 DAP, but to levels of only 65% of that of the control. Kernels heat stressed for 8 days did not recover. When 14C?sucrose was supplied during the heat stress period (513 DAP). kernels from all treatments accumulated more hexoses that sucrose in the pedicel/p?c. However, during the period following heat stress (1022 DAP), pedicel/p?c accumulated sucrose, but only in kernels exposed to long?term heat stress. Soluble invertase activity was inhibited by both short?term and long?term heat stress, whereas the activity of insoluble invertase was affected only by long?term heat stress. These results support the hypothesis that the disruption of kernel growth and more particularly endosperm starch biosynthesis, in response to heat stress, is mainly associated with changes in carbon utilization and partitioning between the different nonstructural carbohydrates within the endosperm rather than with a limitation in carbon supply to the kernel. Therefore, the effect on sink activity does not seem to be attributable to a thermal disruption of kernel uptake of sugars, but rather it is a consequence of heat perturbation of other physiological processes such as endosperm sugar metabolism and starch biosynthesis.

However, utilization of these genetic resources for crop improvement has been difficult. This study was conducted to (a) understand the processes of early embryo growth and development in four Arachis species, two A. hypogaea cultivars and their hybrids and (b) identify parental compatibilities in reciprocal crosses of A. hypogaea. The results indicated that delayed fertilization beyond 24 h, coupled with slow proembryo growth, leads to embryo abortion in many interspecific crosses. For example, in female A. cardenasii crosses, lack of or delayed fertilization leads to failure to obtain hybrids. When A. batizocoi was used as a female parent, delayed fertilization and the inability of quiescent proembryos to resume growth after soil penetration caused abortion. Embryos of A. hypogaea × A. glandulifera crosses developed normally during the first 21 d after fertilization, but then aborted at a later time. In this study, A. hypogaea was always a better female parent than the wild Arachis species. Increasing the number of pollinations per cross, using the cultivated species as the female parent, utilizing different A. hypogaea varieties, and embryo rescue techniques are suggested to improve the probability of obtaining interspecific hybrids in Arachis. © 1995 Annals of Botany Company.",Arachis; Incompatibilities; Interspecific hybrids; Peanut; Wild species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028891125

After 4 and 8 weeks, a higher germination percentage occurred on media with BA and 2iP. Nine morphological types of protocorms were identified and a model to explain protocorm development is proposed. Protocorms developed faster and the production of multiple protocorms increased with all three cytokinins in comparison to the control.

Mitotic counts of chromosomes shows 36 as tetraploid species based on 9 as basic number. Based on length and centromere position the karyotype formula shows 14 pairs of metacentric, 3 pairs of submetacentric and one pair of telocentric chromosomes. The mean chromosome length measure 0.97?m and arm ratio of 1.25. The heterogenity in chromosome set suggests the alloploid origin of the species. Meiotic behaviour of chromosomes was found somehow irregular with high frequency of univalents and low multivalents. The latter insures that the species is not autotetraploid in origin. Also the high level of univalents suggests the structural hybridity of the species. Irregular meiosis lead to form abnormal pollen and non functional gamets which directly decrease fertility and probably affect seed set either at open or self pollination. Cytological results indicate that the species is cytologically complex with alloploid origin and more self incompatible in breeding system. © 1995, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

This interference hypothesis was tested using Bombus impatiens workers. Bees that had learned to handle one type of flower (species A) were retested on species A after they had learned to handle a second type of flower (species B). Bees retested on both simple (red clover Trifolium pratense) and complex (toadflax Linaria vulgaris) flowers showed no evidence of interference after learning simple-flowered plant species (blueweed Echium vulgare; purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria). However, bees relearning the complex flowers of toadflax showed a 2.2-s (81%) increase over their initial access time after switching to a second complex-flowered species (orange touch-me-not Impatiens capensis).

Here we present a description of the Arabidopsis thaliana gynoecium at anthesis. The cylindrical organ can be broken down into three longitudinal regions arranged in an apical-basal order: stigma, style, and ovary. Each region can be distinguished histologically and morphologically. The transmitting (pollination) tract is axially positioned along the center of the gynoecium and spans stigma, style and ovary. Histochemistry, scanning electron microscopy and a style-specific reporter gene are used to compare the wild-type pattern of gynoecium cell types and regions, with patterns formed in gynoecia of individuals homozygous for a series of allelic mutations at the ETTIN locus. ettin gynoecia show morphological and histological alterations that appear to result from the merging of apical and basal regions and the development of abaxial into adaxial tissues. These developmental abnormalities result in a reduction of the ovary region, an expansion of the stylar and stigmatic regions, and the abaxial (outward) proliferation of transmitting tract tissue. The alterations in the mutants can be interpreted as resulting from misspecifications of position along the longitudinal and transverse axes during gynoecium development. The results suggest that early patterning events underlie wild-type gynoecium development, and that ETT functions during this early programming.",Arabidopsis; ETTIN; Flower development; Gynoecium; Positional information,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029008098

When the octoploid plants were used as females, only 2.6% of the pollinated florets set seed, while seed set increased to 39.0% in reciprocal crosses. However, germination was 95.7% for the first group of hybrids and only 18.2% for the reciprocals. These diverse results can be explained by the paternal: maternal endosperm genomic ratios and the hypothesis of polar nuclei activation. The tetraploid?octoploid hybrids did not always contain 42 chromosomes. Octoploid lines derived indirectly from tetraploid (AABB) × hexaploid (AACCDD) crosses were found to retain their A and B genome chromosomes. Univalents in the above hybrids averaged 15.44 in 1990 and 15.15 in 1991, indicating the presence of C and D genome chromosomes inherited from the octoploid lines. Directly synthesized octoploids from diploid (AcAc) × hexaploid (AACCDD) crosses were found to form 20.44 univalents, 5.30 bivalents, and 2.69 trivalents when crossed with AABB tetraploid species. The high number of univalents indicates that chromosomes from at least three genomes, i.e. B, C, and D, remain unpaired, while trivalents are the result of homology between the A and Ac genomes. Hybrids between tetraploid and octoploid lines can be obtained at low frequencies but, regardless of the direction of the cross, these hybrids are highly sterile. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Lentil is one of the principal food crops cultivated in the semiarid regions of the world, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and in the dry areas of the Middle East. The crop is a dietary mainstay in those areas and is mostly consumed by local populations. Of the countries that produce lentil, India is the largest producer followed by Turkey, Canada, and Syria. Lentils are poor competitors and good weed control is essential for successful production. A major food use of lentil is as dhal, decorticated and split lentils, which is a principle ingredient in soups and other dishes prepared in the Indian subcontinent. The chapter presents the major constraints to productionfor example, insects, diseases, and environmental stress. To obtain successful hybridizations it is essential that the reproductive system crossing techniques and environmental conditions should be fully understood.

T0 plants were obtained by co-transforming protoplasts from two different rice suspension cultures with the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene [neo or aph (3?) II] and the ?-glucuronidase gene (uidA or gusA) residing on separate chimeric plasmid constructs. The suspension cultures were derived from callus of immature embryos of indica variety IR54 and japonica variety Radon. One transgenic line of Radon (AR2) contained neo driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and gusA driven by the rice actin promoter. A second Radon line (R3) contained neo driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and gusA driven by a promoter of the rice tungro bacilliform virus. The third transgenic line, IR54-1, contained neo driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and gusA driven by the CaMV 35S. Inheritance of the transgenes in progeny of the transgenic rice was investigated by Southern blot analysis and enzyme assays. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA showed that, regardless of copy numbers of the transgenes in the plant genome and the fact that the two transgenes resided on two different plasmids before transformation, the introduced gusA and neo genes were stably transmitted from one generation to another and co-inherited together in transgenic rice progeny plants derived from self-pollination.

Inbreeding depression was not detected in the mass of seed produced by maternal plants, but selfing significantly reduced germination success by 13-20 per cent relative to outcross seeds. Seedlings produced by self-pollination were 26-31 per cent smaller than outcross progeny. Late life history stages were examined under varied competitive regimes in which each plant was grown with a neighbour of either an inbred or outbred individual. Progeny resulting from self-pollinations showed a 14-30 per cent reduction in ovule number per locule, and their pollen production per flower was reduced by 28-33 per cent. Adult above-ground biomass showed the greatest inbreeding depression, ranging from 24-50 per cent depending on the competitive conditions. Thus progeny resulting from selfing are smaller as adults and contribute significantly fewer potential gametes into the gene pool as pollen grains and ovules. The multiplicative effects of these characters is calculated. For all traits except ovule number, outcross progeny from parents of the same population did not differ significantly from outcross progeny produced by parents that came from populations separated by 10 km, suggesting relatively little differentiation between populations. The relative performance of self and outcross progeny in later life history stages was independent of the relative performance observed in earlier stages. © 1995 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Competition; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Mimulus guttatus; Ovule production; Pollen production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028983897

Pflanzengenetik K., Corrensstrasse 3, 06466 Gatersleben, Germany","Stimulation of the stigma of Hibiscus flowers by pollen, wounding (heat), or cold shock (4°C) evokes electrical potential changes in the style, which propagate toward the ovary with a speed of 1.3 to 3.5 cm s-1. Potential changes were measured intracellularly by microelectrodes inserted in the style. The resting potential ranged from -90 to -112 mV (n = 20) in cells of the vascular tissue and from -184 to -220 mV (n = 22) in cells of the pollen-transmitting tissue. The amplitude of the potential changes was between 40 and 150 mV, depending on the kind of stimulus. Self- as well as cross-pollination hyperpolarized the resting potential after 50 to 100 s, followed by a series of 10 to 15 action potentials. In contrast, cooling of the stigma caused a single action potential with a different shape and duration, whereas wounding generated a strong depolarization of the membrane potential with an irregular form and a lower transmission rate. To determine the physiological function of the different signals measured in the style, the gas exchange and metabolite concentrations were measured in the ovary before and 10 min after stimulation of the stigma. Self- and cross-pollination caused a transient increase of the ovarian respiration rate by 12%, which was measured 3 to 5 min after the stigma was stimulated. Simultaneously, the levels of ATP, ADP, and starch increased significantly. In contrast, both cold shock and wounding of the stigma caused a spontaneous decrease of the CO2 content in the measuring chamber, as well as reduced metabolite concentrations in the ovary. Since the transport of labeled auxin from the top to the base of the style lasts at least 45 min, the influence of a chemical substance transmitted within 10 min is unlikely. Thus, our results strongly support the view that different, stimulus-dependent electrical signals cause specific responses of the ovarian metabolism.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028831308

Emphasis has been placed on development of hybrids for areas with high yield potential and open-pollinated cultivars (OPCs) for environments limited by biotic or abiotic stresses. This study was conducted to determine the physiological, phenological and morphological bases for yield differences in a group of representative hybrids and OPCs available in the region. Nine cultivars (five hybrids and four OPCs) were evaluated in 11 diverse environments of the region ranging in mean grain yield from 0.5 to 8.0 Mg ha-1. Hybrids consistently outyielded OPCs by 1.0 to 1.5 Mg ha-1 across the range of environments tested. Differences in grain yield between hybrids and OPCs were mostly due to greater biomass production, higher harvest index and a larger daily ear growth rate (2.2 g d-1 ear-1 for hybrids versus 1.8 g d-1 ear-1 for OPCs). Within hybrids or OPCs, however, differences in yield depended on the duration of grain filling and not on ear growth rate. For example, grain filling in higher-yielding hybrids CB-HS7 and HB-85 required about 7 more days than the lower-yielding hybrids P-8916 and H-5. A similar situation existed within the OPCs. A strong negative relationship was detected between grain-filling length and maturity, indicating that earliness and smaller leaf number were associated with longer grain-filling duration and yield. Grain moisture was strongly related to grain phenological development and was independent of cultivar. These results reveal that an effective mechanism to increase maize yield is to select for extended grain filling. Breeding schemes in use should consider these selection criteria. © 1995.",Diseases; Drought; Source-sink; Variety trials; Yield; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028877487

This makes cross breeding of plantain and banana difficult. Nonetheless, several triploid plantain and banana cultivars produce seeds after hand pollination with diploid parents. This paper reports results about the pattern of seed variation, success of in vitro germination and hybrid production after triploiddiploid crosses. Between-and within-clones differences in seed set were observed. ABB cooking bananas had the highest rates of seed production followed by AAB French plantains. Plantains produced more diploid than tetraploid offsprings after triploiddiploid crosses, which suggests that meiosis resulted in the production of balanced haploid gametes (n = x) due to normal chromosome behaviour between homologous genomes. Seed set variation within clones was influenced by both the production of 2n (= 3x) gametes in the triploid parent and climatic factors. Indeed, seed production, embryo and seed germination success, and euploid and tetraploid hybrid production followed a pattern of seasonal variation reaching a peak in September. High frequency of seed with tetraploid embryos was obtained in the period from January to mid-March. The results demonstrate that production of desirable tetraploids would be more efficient when hand pollinations are done under high temperature, high solar radiation and low relative humidity. These seem to be the most convenient conditions for relatively high production of 2n eggs as compared to haploid gametes. © 1995 Annals of Botany Company.",2n gametes; Banana; Embryo culture; Fertility; Musa spp. AAA group; Musa spp. AAB group; Musa spp. ABB group; Plantain; Ploidy; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029109317

Extracts from pea ovaries showed arginine decarboxylase (ADC) activity, but ornithine decarboxylase and arginase activity were not detected. ADC activity decreased in presenescent ovaries and increased markedly after induction of fruit set with gibberellic acid.

Instead we have shown that Vicia faba legumin and vicilin storage proteins are synthesized early in development in the suspensor, the endosperm, the globular stage embryo and even in the thin-walled parenchyma cells of the maternal seed coat. The proteins appear and disappear at precise developmental stages specific for each tissue before they again and finally accumulate in cotyledon-stage embryos. The final expression level of the V. faba legumin B4 gene is influenced by cis-regulatory elements upstream and downstream of the transcription initiation site acting at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional/translationallevel. Studies in transgenic tobacco seeds revealed complex interactions between homologous transgene sequences resulting in both trans-suppression and trans-stimulation of legumin B4 target transgen expression. Seed protein gene expression is not only developmentally but also metabolically regulated. In Vicia faba cotyledons incubated ex planta for 2 to 4 days osmotic pressure and soluble sugar concentrations differentially influence storage protein mRNA levels. Legumin B mRNA levels are dramatically reduced by high hexose concentrations but only little influenced by osmotic values whereas vicilin mRNA levels strongly react to the osmotic value of the medium but much less to sugar concentrations. Particle bombardment experiments with legumin B4 promoter/GUS constructs suggest that 5'-flanking, cis-regulatory elements are involved in the response. The complexity of the regulatory network is underlined by the fact that in Arabidopsis thaliana the FUS3 locus specifically regulates storage protein synthesis but also induces changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism seemingly by partially omitting the dessication phase of development. © 1995, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

Here we show by a sensitive immunohistological technique that the two Vicia faba L. storage proteins vicilin and legumin are accumulated in substantial amounts in the suspensor and coenocytic endosperm and to a lesser extent in the mid-globular embryo. Both proteins appear and disappear at precise stages specific for each tissue. In the endosperm the accumulation starts around 12 d after pollination (DAP). After a maximum attained at 1415 DAP, storage proteins are degraded within about 4 d. Accumulation is restricted to that part of the endosperm which covers the embryo and displays the highest levels of endoploidy (maximum 96n). In all other parts of the endosperm, storage proteins do not appear to accumulate, although storage-protein-specific mRNA synthesis takes place. In the suspensor, storage proteins are already observed at 6 DAP and disappear very quickly at approximately 10 DAP. Low amounts of legumin and vicilin are also detectable in the mid-globular embryo, but disappear completely as the embryo enters the heart stage. We conclude that storage proteins of Vicia faba accumulated transiently during early seed development are used as nutritive reserves for the growing embryo. © 1995, Springer-Verlag.

Six spring?type cultivars of B. napus and four strains of S. arvensis were reciprocally crossed through controlled crosses. No hybrid was yielded from any cross. However, one hybrid with 28 chromosomes was obtained from B. napus×S. arvensis through ovule culture. The hybrid plant was highly sterile and set no seed on open pollination. Two F2 plants, with 35 and 36 chromosomes respectively, were obtained through self?pollination by hand. Backcross of B. napus produced 23 plants carrying some characteristics of S. arvensis, but backcross to S. arvensis failed to produce a plant. The chromosome counts of the BC1F1 plants indicated that gametes with more than nine chromosomes were favoured during the meiosis. The data demonstrated that gene transfer from S. arvensis to B. napus was very difficult under controlled cross and backcross, while to transfer genes from B. napus to S. arvensis would be extremely remote even under the most favorable conditions.

In intact flowers as well as in excised central columns, stigma- or rostellum-applied ACC or ?-aminoisobutyric acid were largely immobile. Local treatment of the central column of previously aminoethoxyvinylglycine-treated flowers with either ethylene or 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (ethephon) rapidly induced emission of ethylene from the petals, showing that ethylene is readily translocated within the flower. Creation of alternative outlets (incisions) in the labellum or the central column significantly delayed the occurrence of senescence symptoms in ACC-treated flowers. The results do not confirm the presumed role of ACC as a signal in interorgan communication during flower senescence.

Ultrathinsections of fixed and embedded specimens were treated with immunogold label for ultrastructural localization of acidic pectins (monoclonal antibody JIM 5), methyl-esterified pectins (monoclonal antibody JIM 7) and callose (anti-(1-3)-?-glucan antibody) in order to elucidate the distribution and intracellular pathway of the cell wall constituents_ Pectins, present in the intine of the pollen grain and in the outer layer of the bilayered pollen tube wall, seem to be synthesized in the dictyosomes activated upon germination. Their intracellular transport from the dictyosomes to the pollen tube tip, the site of fusion with the cell wall, occurs in fibrillar or bipartite particles that contain pectins in a highly methyl-esterified form, but no callose. In both intine and pollen tube cell wall a radial gradient of pectin esterification is observed. Pectins are less esterified with increasing distance from the plasma membrane. Considering the fact that pectins are secreted in a highly esterified form, the gradient indicates the presence of enzymatic activity, causing pectin de-esterification during cell wall development. Upon incompatible pollination both layers of the pollen tube wall undergo thickening. Pectinaceous particles are deposited on the inside of the cell wall or seemingly get stuck during migration through the inner callosic layer. Whereas pectinaceous secretory vesicles in compatible pollen tubes show a high grade of esterification, during the incompatibility reaction pectic aggregates of low esterification grade appear in the cytoplasm. This might indicate the presence of de-esterifying enzymes in the secretory vesicles. © 1995, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

Consequently, the Tree Genetic Improvement Program uses a very large quantity of pollen in order to carry out the controlled pollination projects in those seed orchards. Moreover, controlled pollination is carried out within a very short time-frame and very often the receptivity period occurs before the time of pollen dispersion. It is for these reasons that the pollen bank was created in Québec. This manuscript summarize the process of long term preservation of a large quantity of tree pollen. It is possible to preserve the pollen of coniferous trees on a large scale for up to five years. It is more difficult to manipulate the pollen of deciduous trees. Quatre vingt-trois vergers à graines de première génération furent établis en 1973 afin de produire des graines provenant darbres génétiquement améliorés. Le Programme damélioration génétique des arbres forestiers nécessite lutilisation de très grandes quantités de pollen Iors de la réalisation de travaux de pollinisation dirigée et de masse dans ces vergers. De plus, les travaux de pollinisation doivent être réalisés à lintérieur de seulement quelques jours et souvent les inflorescences femelles deviennent réceptives avant que le pollen ne soit disséminé.

Using specific antibodies raised against gH2B and gH3, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial aspects of the appearance of these histone variants during male gametogenesis. Neither gH2B nor gH3 was detected in microsporocytes during meiotic division or in microspores before microspore mitosis. However, both gH2B and gH3 were abundantly present in mid bicellular pollen and these histones continued to be detectable in germinated pollen tubes after pollination. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry revealed that these proteins were present not only in generative nuclei during the maturation process, but also in the two sperm nuclei formed by division of the generative nucleus. By contrast, these proteins were not found in the vegetative nuclei. It appears, therefore, that both gH2B and gH3 are specific to male gametic (generative and sperm) nuclei in L. longiflorum. The results also suggest that these male gamete-specific histones might be newly synthesized in the progenitor of sperm cells for the differentiation of male gametes, as occurs in spermatogenesis in animals. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029047693

Bot. 15: 243250. Copenhagen. ISSN 0107055X. The area of species?rich hay meadows in Norway has been drastically reduced during the 20th century. This continuing process results in fragmentation and isolation of remaining habitats. Small and isolated populations may have reduced gene flow. This is a crucial factor for the structure and cohesiveness of populations. Gene flow in plant species is regulated by pollen and seed dispersal, and pollen dispersal is controlled by the species' mating system. As part of a research project on habitat fragmentation three meadow species (Dactylorhiza sambucina, Hypochoeris maculata, Polygala vulgaris) with different life strategies were therefore selected for studies of their mating systems. A hand pollination experiment showed that both Dactylorhiza sambucina and Polygala vulgaris were self?compatible. Seed set in H. maculata was low and the species may be considered as pseudo?self?compatible or self?incompatible. Using Bawa's (1974) criteria, however, also Hypochoeris maculata should be considered as self?compatible. All three species enhanced outbreeding but P vulguris also proved to be a good selfer and autogamous. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028994703

Moench is a major problem in the cultivation of this crop plant. The influence of potassium nutrition on germinability, abscisic acid (ABA) content and embryo ABA sensitivity in its developing seeds was investigated. Plants were grown in sand culture under three different potassium treatments: K1 (control), K2 (one third of the control potassium supply), and K3 (one ninth of the control potassium supply). Reduced potassium increased the germinability of developing seeds during the late stages of maturation (31 and 36 days after pollination, DAP), particularly in K2 grains. These changes in seed germinability were paralleled by a reduced ABA content in the seed and by a lower embryonic sensitivity to ABA. The ABA content of K2 intact grains peaked at 25 DAP and then decreased sharply, being 3050% lower than that in the controls at 31 and 36 DAP. ABA content in the control gains peaked later in the developmental period (at 31 DAP). By contrast K3 grains had a remarkably constant ABA content during most of the developmental period (2036 DAP). Sensitivity to ABA was markedly reduced in the embryos from both the low potassium treatments, particularly when tested at an ABA concentration of 5?M.

Where genetic load is caused by deleterious recessive mutations in mutation-selection balance, the removal of inbred offspring may prevent the expression of mutations as homozygotes. This would shelter the mutations from selection, and permit an increase in the genetic load relative to the case with no competition among embryos. This study employs existing models of genetic load to assess the effects of embryo competition on load. Mutations which are not expressed in the embryo (e.g. chlorophyll deficiency mutations) are sheltered from selection by the removal of inbred seed, and increase in frequency relative to the case without embryo competition. Moreover, if embryo competition is discontinued after several generations, expression of the accumulated load causes a temporary, but pronounced drop in mean fitness. By contrast, mutations which are expressed in the embryo may affect the outcome of competition, and thus experience added selection relative to the case with no competition. Genetic load at these loci may thus be reduced, although the exact outcome depends upon the expression of the mutations in heterozygotes. The mechanism of embryo competition must be known before the long-term effects of management practices which enhance embryo competition can be predicted. Even where selective abortion increases the fitness of stocks over the long term, the accumulation of additional mutations can produce a dramatic loss of fitness if selective seed abortion is discontinued. Thus, once a programme to enhance selective abortion is begun, it may be impossible to cease this programme without irreparable damage to the stocks. © 1995 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Embryo competition; Inbreeding depression; Mutation; Purging; Supplemental mass-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029198169

Application of 25 ?g fruit?1 of paclobutrazol (PP333), an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, reduced the rate of growth and accelerated fruit abscission in both varieties. In contrast, gibberellin A3 (GA3) stimulated fruit growth only in the self?incompatible mandarin. Clementine fruits, in the absence of pollination, showed an approximately 2?fold transient increase in the free abscisic acid (ABA) content shortly after petal fall. In Satsuma, a very small accumulation of ABA was detected. Paclobutrazol treatment induced a 3?fold increase in ABA in Satsuma fruits but did not substantially affect the pattern of ABA accumulation in Clementine. In this variety, GA3 suppressed the ABA increase observed in untreated fruits. These effects were observed 24 h after treatment. However, in Satsuma fruits, the effect of GA3 on the ABA content was negligible. In addition, a comparative analysis of growing and non?growing fruits of Clementine showed that ABA, on a per unit weight basis, was always higher in the non?growing fruits. Treatment with 85 ?M fluridone, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis and thus indirectly of ABA, delayed fruit abscission in Clementine, but also decreased fruit growth.

Interspecific pollination studies on the cruciferous weed Arabidopsis thaliana revealed only a broad specificity of pollen recognition such that pollen from all tested members of the crucifer family were recognized, whereas pollen from almost all other species failed to hydrate. Genetic analysis of A. thaliana has identified three genes that are essential for this recognition process. Recessive mutations in any of these genes result in male sterility due to the production of pollen grains that fail to hydrate when placed on the stigma, but that are capable of hydrating and growing a pollen tube in vitro. Results from mixed pollination experiments suggest that the mutant pollen grains specifically lack a functional pollen?stigma recognition system. All three mutations described also result in a defect in the wax layer normally found on stems and leaves, similar to previously described eceriferum (cer) mutations. Genetic complementation and mapping experiments demonstrated that the newly identified mutants are allelic to the previously identified genes cer1, cer3 and cer6. TEM analysis of the ultrastructure of the pollen coating revealed that all of the mutant pollen grains bear coatings of normal thickness and that tryphine lipid droplets are missing in cer1?147, are reduced in size in cer6?2654 and appear normal in cer3?2186. Temperature shift experiments revealed that the block in the recognition step of the mutant pollen grains can be suppressed by pollination at lower temperatures but not by reduced temperatures during pollen development. These results suggest that the lipids which are altered in the cer mutations may be important in regulating some biophysical property of the pollen coating. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Box 475, Canberra, 2601, Australia","The reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) to triose phosphate is a key step in photosynthesis linking the photochemical events of the thylakoid membranes with the carbon metabolism of the photosynthetic carbon-reduction (PCR) cycle in the stroma. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: NADP oxidoreductase (GAPDH) is one of the two chloroplast enzymes which catalyse this reversible conversion. We report on the engineering of an antisense RNA construct directed against the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) chloroplastlocated GAPDH (A subunit). The construct was integrated into the tobacco genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf discs. Of the resulting transformants, five plants were recovered with reduced GAPDH activities ranging from 11 to 24% of wild-type (WT) activities. Segregation analysis of the kanamycin-resistance character in self-pollinated T1 seed from each of the five transformants revealed that one plant (GAP-R) had two active DNA inserts and the others had one insert. T1 progeny from GAP-R was used to generate plants with GAPDH activities ranging from WT levels to around 7% of WT levels. These were used to study the effect of variable GAPDH activities on metabolite pools for ribulose1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and PGA, and the accompanying effects on the rate of CO2 assimilation and other gasexchange parameters. The RuBP pool size was linearly related to GAPDH activity once GAPDH activity dropped below the range for WT plants, but the rate of CO2 assimilation was not affected until RuBP levels dropped to 30-40% of WT levels. That is, the CO2 assimilation rate fell when RuBP per ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) site fell below 2 mol·(mol site)-1 while the ratio for WT plants was 4-5 mol·m(mol site)-1. Leaf conductance was not reduced in leaves with reduced GAPDH activities, resulting in an increase in the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 partial pressure. Conductance in plants with reduced GAPDH activities was still sensitive to CO2 and showed a normal decline with increases in CO2 partial pressure. Although PGA levels did not fluctuate greatly, the effect of reduced GAPDH activity on RuBP-pool size and assimilation rate can be interpreted as being due to a blockage in the regeneration of RuBP. Concomitant gas-ex change and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements indicated that photosynthesis changed from being Rubisco-limited to being RuBP-regeneration-limited at a lower CO2 partial pressure in the antisense plants than in WT plants. Photosynthetic electron transport was down-regulated by the build-up of a large proton gradient and the electron-transport chain did not become over-reduced due to a shortage of NADP. Plants with severely reduced GAPDH activity were not photoinhibited despite the continuous presence of a large thylakoid proton gradient in the light. Along with plant size, Rubisco activity, leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll content were reduced in plants with the lowest GAPDH activities. We conclude that chloroplastic GAPDH activity does not appear to limit steady-state photosynthetic CO2 assimilation at ambient CO2. This is because WT leaves maintain the ratio of RuBP per Rubisco site about twofold higher than the level required to achieve a maximal rate of CO2 assimilation. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Antisense RNA; Glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenase; Metabolite pools Nicotiana(transgenic plants); Photosynthesis; Stomate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029137802

In order to determine the relative importance of pollen viability and stigmatic receptivity for seed setting, plants of the rice cultivar IR36 were treated with artificial sea water (0,10, 25 or 5Omol?3 with respect to NaCl) from 1 month after germination until the main tiller flowered. An increase in the salinity in the medium resulted in a decrease in the number of fertile florets and in the viability of pollen as determined both by pollen germination and by pollen staining with the tetrazolium salt 3?(4,5?dimethyl?ithyazolyl)?2,5?diphenyl monotetrazolium bromide. In order to assess the effects of salt on stigmas, seed production was measured for salt?grown and non?salt?grown female plants pollinated with viable pollen (from plants grown in the absence of salt). The percentage of seed set was reduced by 38% when the female plants were grown in 1Omol m?3 Na and by 72% at 25mol m?3 Na: no seed setting was recorded for plants grown in 50mol m?3 Na. Comparisons between crosses involving male and female parents grown at different salinities indicated that effects on the female plants dominated those on pollinator plants. Mineral analysis of leaves of different ages showed that there was a gradient of K concentration from leaf to leaf which was opposite to that of Na and Cl at all levels of applied salinity: K was maximal in the flag leaf, where Na and Cl were minimal. Analysis also revealed that there was an increase in the concentrations of Na and Cl and a decrease in the concentration of K in the pollen grains and stigmas of plants subjected to saline conditions. Correlations between the concentration of Na and Cl in pollen and pollen staining and pollen germination in vitro suggest that Na and Cl perse were responsible for the poor viability. The change in ionic concentrations in pollen and stigmas was much larger than that in the younger leaves, and in particular very much larger than that in the lemmas and paleas.

According to species, PI can be both developmentally and environmentally regulated. We investigated the presence and developmental regulation of PI in the flowers of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. By trypsin affinity chromatography a small protein, Np?PI?II, was isolated. This protein had an N?terminus similar to a part of a Nicotiana alata PI?II, and an inhibitory activity towards trypsin. Inhibitory activity is expressed at very early stages of floral development. No inhibitor is present in the vegetative meristems. The inhibitory activity remains high throughout flower maturation and rapidly declines in the ovary after pollination. In the stigma of mature Nicotiana tabacum flowers trypsin inhibitory activity is detected extracellularly. Proteinase inhibitor activity is not a regular feature of the stigmas of several solanaceous genera. Proteinase inhibitors apparently have no function in the development of floral structures and probably act as protective agents against fungal infection of and insect damage to the floral parts and the developing fruit.

In Japan this species is composed of two floral morphs, a homostyled morph in which the level of the stigma and the anther of longer stamens are more or less the same, and a long?styled morph in which the stigmas conspicuously protrude from the level of anthers of the longer stamens. Homostyled plants are common in artificially disturbed urban and ruderal habitats, whereas long?styled plants occur mainly in less disturbed habitats of maritime Pinus thunbergii forests. Each of five populations examined in this study was exclusively composed of one or the other of the two floral morphs, with no mixed populations observed. Measurements of floral traits and reproductive parameters indicated that plants of homostyled populations exhibited characteristics of a typical autogamous breeding system, whereas those of long?styled populations exhibited characteristics of predominant outcrossing. Crossing experiments revealed that the length of the stigmas and anthers of longer stamens, which characterizes the two floral morphs, is quantitatively inherited. The results obtained suggest that disassortative pollination among different floral morphs, which is commonly observed in some other heterostylous species, does not occur in O. corniculata populations in Japan. The origin of homostyled and long?styled morphs in O. corniculata is also discussed. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Results confirmed that susceptibility in cotyledons was not necessarily associated with susceptibility in either true leaves in growth chambers or adult plants in the field. However, resistance at the 2-true-leaf stage in growth chambers was highly correlated with resistance of field-grown plants. Results also showed that 20 muskmelon genotypes resistant to race 1 at the cotyledonary stage were also resistant at the 2-leaf-stage and as adult plants in the field. The same was true for ten genotypes with race 2 inoculations. Because muskmelon genotypes expressing resistance in cotyledons were also resistant in true leaves in growth chambers or the field, the use of plants at the cotyledonary stage is recommended for screening for powdery mildew resistance caused by race 1 or race 2 of S. fuliginea.

In comparison to other families, e.g. Orchidaceae, the flowers of Cactaceae are of a morphologically primitive structure. Nevertheless, they show adaptive traits towards different groups of pollinators. Adaptations are reflected to a certain degree also in their scent composition as illustrated by the selection of analytical data presented in this overview. Special attention is given to night?scented species flowering in most cases only during one night and being pollinated either by moths or by bats. The representatives of the first group show similarities in their scent composition to well?known moth flowers in other families, while the second group is dominated by repulsive garlic or cabbage?like odours caused by large amounts of sulphur?containing compounds such as dimethyl disulphide and methyl thioacetate. Among the scent components of the diurnal species, being pollinated by bees or a mixed spectrum of insects, the musty?earthy smelling dehydrogeosmin and geosmin deserve special attention.

In some of these, inbreeding depression after selfing or mating between close neighbours and outbreeding depression following crossing over large distances may lead to an intermediate crossing distance with optimal fitness. We studied the relationship between outcrossing distance and offspring fitness in a large population of the rare herbaceous perennial Gentiana pneumonanthe. The relative success of selfing and cross pollination with pollen from increasing distances from maternal plants, including an interpopulation cross, was measured as seed set and seed weight, and in a consecutive glasshouse experiment as the proportion of seeds germinating, seedling weight, adult weight and total relative fitness. Regression analyses showed significant positive relationships between outcrossing distance and the fitness components seed set, seedling weight and adult weight. Additional statistics showed, however, that the observed significant regressions were mainly the result of a relatively low fitness following selfing (inbreeding depression) and a comparatively high performance of the interpopulation crosses (heterosis). No significant effects of within?population crossing distance were found when selfing and interpopulation crosses were omitted from the analyses. We therefore conclude that there is no substantial evidence for an effect of outcrossing distance on fitness components in the studied population of Gentiana pneumonanthe. The results are discussed in the context of conservation biology of rare plant species. Artificial interpopulation crossing may be a way to counteract the losses of genetic variation and fitness in small, isolated populations. In our opinion, however, this is only a feasible management option for very rare and endangered species. 1995 Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",conservation biology; fitness; inbreeding depression; outbreeding depression; outcrossing distance; population genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028978178

The population was advanced by open-pollination in an isolated plot under mildew-free conditions for eight years. Samples of generations Syn-0 through Syn-7 were inoculated in the laboratory with two mildew isolates, one avirulent to either resistance gene, the other virulent to Rm1 and avirulent to rm2, to discriminate resistant and susceptible phenotypes. From the proportions of resistant plants, frequencies of Rm1 and rm2 were calculated and the fitness of carriers of resistance alleles was estimated in relation to carriers of susceptibility alleles at the two loci using continuous models and linear regression analyses. Frequencies of the two resistance genes oscillated only weakly over the eight generations. Coefficients of selection against Rm1-and rm2rm2 genotypes were -0.04 and -0.02, respectively, and not significantly different from zero. Thus the two resistance genes were selectively neutral.

Early?blooming flowers had larger numbers of pistils and stamens, higher seed?set, and heavier seeds than the later?blooming flowers within a ramet under natural conditions. These differences remained after flowers were hand?pollinated. When one flower was removed from a ramet with two flowers, seed?set and seed weight of the remaining flower did not increase. Because flowering occurs sequentially within a ramet, anthesis per ramet was extended with flower number. Production of the second and the third flowers was considered for plants to reduce entire failure in setting seeds under the condition of unpredictable pollinator activity.

Late pre- and postpollination embryology revealed absence of functional megaspore mother cell and megagametophytes respectively. Malformed megagametophytes were characterized with reduction in embryo sac volume (8-12.5% of normal), devoid of nucleate cells especially, polar and the antipodal cells, massively vacuolated with no recognizable zygotes or embryos. Regular embryo sacs commenced degeneration 8 days after anthesis in unfertilized ovules of all zero pollinated pistils. Degeneration signal initiated from its thin cell wall and transducted radially inwards and outwards to the central cell and the surrounding nucellus respectively. Both integuments (inner and outer) as well as the nucellus of functional (possessing nucleate cells) and non-functional (deprived of nucleate cells) megagametophytes appeared healthy and developed normally. Physical seed analysis showed that phenotypically normal but functionally deprived pseudo-seed (without endosperm and embryo) and true seed are produced at a ratio of approximately 1:2. Two distinct but complementary developmental pathways of fertilization failure, seed abortion as well as poor germination in cassava have been identified, They are: 1. Ovules devoid of functional megaspore due to lack of megasporocyte during megasporogenesis and 2. Embryo sacs devoid of nucleate cells due to mitotic inactivity at megagametogenesis resulting in structurally and functionally deprived megagametophyte but morphologically normal ovules. These pathways, either separately or collectively are implicated as largely responsible for the reproductive and conventional breeding barriers in the genus Manihot. © 1995, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Histological analysis revealed poor endosperm development from 18 days after pollination onwards, followed by malformation and abortion of embryos. To create interspecific hybrids between Alstroemeria aurea, Alstroemeria pelegrina, Alstroemeria magnifica, Alstroemeria inodora and Alstroemeria psittacina in diallelic combinations, an ovule culture technique was developed. Influence of age of ovules, sucrose concentration of medium and temperature and light during culture were tested. Harvesting ovules before the onset of endosperm degeneration, i.e. at 14 days after pollination, cutting them into halves and culturing the micropylar halves in a rotating liquid culture medium containing 6% sucrose at 21 °C in the dark, led to successful embryo rescue. Germinated embryos were subcultured in vitro until rhizomes were formed, a prerequisite for successful transfer to the greenhouse. Full grown plants all showed interspecific morphological traits and analysis of chromosome complement confirmed their hybrid nature. Diploid hybrid plants were obtained in all the 20 interspecific 2x-2x combinations. A total of 260 interspecific hybrid plants was produced. Half-ovule culture of 2x-4x and 4x-2x crosses resulted in 43 triploid hybrid plants. Because interspecific hybrids were obtained in 100% of the interspecific combinations, it is expected that the described technique can be applied to overcome post-fertilization barriers in most crosses within the genus Aktroemeria. © 1995.",Alstroemeria; Embryo histology; Interspecific hybridization; Ovule culture; Ovule histology; Post-fertilization barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029188316

Almost all of the seeds of A. mono germinated in the first spring, while those of A. palmatum var. amoenum showed a delay in germination of almost one year. A. rufinerve showed a rather opportunistic germination habit. Both A. palmatum var. amoenum and A. rufinerve form short?term persistent seed banks, but without input of newly dispersed seeds they may become extinct in about one year. The seed bank for these two species is not as significant as for a typical pioneer species, and the seedling bank is important for all three species. Only a small proportion of the dispersed propagules contained viable embryos, mainly due to pollination failure or abortion (A. mono and A. palmatum var. amoenum), and invertebrate predation (A. rufinerve). For all three species, larger seed crops had a higher percentage of viable seeds. Even for these relatively small, wind?dispersed seeds, the predation pressure was very high. A large part of the dispersed seeds was eaten by wood mice during the first winter (3080 %). Estimation from the 5?yr average of seed dispersal and seedling emergence showed that only 716 % of the dispersed viable seeds succeeded in germinating. 1995 IAVS ? the International Association of Vegetation Science",Ogawa Forest Reserve; Post?dispersal mortality; Predation; Seed bank; Seed dynamics; Seedling bank,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995092

We examined the mating system and inbreeding depression at four life stages in a diploid population of Epilobium angustifolium (Onagraceae). The multilocus rate of self-fertilization, inferred from the segregation of allozymes at two polymorphic loci (Pgi-2, Mdh-2) among seedlings from 22 open-pollinated plants, was 0.06 (SE±0.10). However, after adjusting for differential mortality of selfed progeny prior to the seedling stage, the selfing rate was 0.45. The parental inbreeding coefficient (F) was -0.26 (SE±0.103) indicating more heterozygotes than in a randomly mating population. The magnitude of inbreeding depression at seed maturation, seed germination, juvenile survival and dry mass at 8 weeks was measured in a greenhouse experiment. Thirty-four plants, grown from open-pollinated seed, were each self-fertilized and randomly outcrossed. We observed significant inbreeding depression at all four stages, although its magnitude differed significantly among maternal plants and among stages. Inbreeding depression was largest during seed maturation (0.87), where seed-set in outcrossed flowers (65.7 per cent) was eight times higher than in selfed flowers (8.3 per cent). Inbreeding depression for dry mass after 8 weeks (0.50) was at least twice that for germination (0.25) and survival (0.15). The magnitude of inbreeding depression for each of the 34 maternal parents was not significantly correlated across life stages, suggesting that its genetic basis varies across the life cycle. Our results indicate that E. angustifolium exhibits high levels of inbreeding depression, much of which is expressed early in the life cycle, during seed maturation, consistent with results for other long-lived, outcrossing species. However, given its moderate rate of self-fertilization, the total inbreeding depression (0.95) maintained in E. angustifolium is very high in comparison to other angiosperms. © 1995 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Epilobium angustifolium; Family variation; Inbreeding depression; Isozymes; Life stage; Mating system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028982461

One transgenic tobacco plant, homozygous for an antisense transgene able to silence the expression of nitrite reductase host genes, and encoding the second enzyme of the nitrate assimilation pathway, was used to pollinate two different cultivars of wild type tobacco plants. Seeds were sown at high density in the greenhouse and watered with a nutrient solution containing nitrate. Green plants able to develop normally emerged at a frequency of 5.10-4 in a mass of chlorotic retarded plants. Phenotypic and genetic analysis, chloroplast counting in stomatal guard cells and molecular hybridizations revealed that 22% of these plants were gynogenetic haploid plants exhibiting the maternal phenotype whereas the remaining 78% were true diploid plants that have lost the antisense transgene. These results demonstrate that a transgene able to silence the expression of a housekeeping gene can be utilized as a counter-selectionable marker for the rapid and easy selection of spontaneous haploid plants in transformable species. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029188577

The crater continues as a slit?like canal through the style and into the ovary. Both crater and canal are lined by several layers of fusiform and thin?walled cells which are continuous in two narrow regions in the ovary. Postanthesis and before pollination, the middle lamella of cells lining the stigmatic crater and stylar transmitting tissue undergoes dissolution. This occurs in a progression down the style with cells separating partially or wholly from neighbours. Dissolution is initiated at intercellular junctions where wall fibrils loosen and variously?sized and ?shaped holes appear. Cytoplasmic changes include increased dictyosome activity, increased rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum at the periphery of cells and accumulation of electron opaque deposits at the plasma membrane. The crater fills with stigmatic fluid and the diameter of the stylar canal increases. Pollen germinates in the secretion?filled crater, and pollen tubes grow down the style between the cells of the transmitting tissue but do not enter the canal. They emerge at the entrance to the ovary cavity and grow over one or two narrow strips of ovarian transmitting tissue cells which are present throughout the length of the ovary close to the ovules. This ensures that tubes grow in close proximity to the micropyles. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Sw. is revised following extensive field studies of population variation in the Western Cape, South Africa. Principal component and cluster analyses revealed clear distinctions between populations from sandplain, semi?arid and montane environments. Diagnostic characters were found in each of the population clusters indicating the existence of a species complex, rather than a single taxon as in the current taxonomy. We propose, therefore, that the name D. draconis (L.f.) Sw. be restricted to the individuals of the sandplain populations from which the type was collected. We reinstate an earlier name, Disa harveiana Lindl., to describe the montane populations which possess several autapomorphic characters. We also show that the geographical variation in spur length and flowering time within this species can be partitioned into two geographically distinct subspecies: D. harveiana subsp. harveiana and D. harveiana subsp. longicalcarata Johnson & Linder. The populations from the semi?arid Karoo region were recognized as a distinct new species, Disa karooica Johnson & Linder, on the basis of their peculiar petal structure. A cladistic analysis indicated that the three species forming the D. draconis complex form a monophyletic and relatively specialized lineage within Disa sect. Coryphaea. The revised classification also has important conservation implications as D. draconis, previously considered a common species, is now restricted to a few highly threatened populations on the west coast near Cape Town.

In cross-pollination within C. melo, the pollen tubes entered the ovarian cavity within 24 h, and fertilization occurred within 48 h. Pollen germinated well after cross-pollination between the species, but pollen tubes grew slowly. C. metuliferus pollen tubes were arrested in the stigma or the upper style of C. melo flowers. The influence of 100-, 150-, and 200-krad gamma radiation on in vitro germination, pollen tube growth of C. melo and C. metuliferus, and on in vivo fertilization of C. melo was studied. Pollen of C. metuliferus appeared to be much less sensitive to gamma rays than that of C. melo. Higher radiation doses were found to reduce fruit set of C. melo. Irradiation of pollen of C. melo always resulted in pseudo-fertilization. We attempted to overcome the prefertilization crossing barrier between C. melo and C. metuliferus by using techniques of bud pollination, benzyladenine (BA) treatment, and irradiated mentor pollen. Ten lines of C. melo and 6 accessions of C. metuliferus were used as female and male parents, respectively. The techniques of BA and bud pollination were ineffective. Numerous fruits with few embryos were obtained on some of the C. melo lines after using the irradiated mentor pollen technique. Embryos, which were isolated at the age of 2025 days and cultured on medium consisting of 1/3 Murashige and Skoog medium, were observed to provide normal development.

Since deviation from this nuclear ratio (2:1 maternal/paternal) in the endosperm can result in abortion, it has been suggested that the genomes of the sperm and/or central cell are differentially imprinted during sexual development. By crossing a normal diploid maize line as female with its autotetraploid counterpart, an unbalanced genomic ratio (2:2 maternal/paternal) is created in the endosperm which often results in the eventual abortion of the tissue. Detailed structural comparison of these aberrant endosperms with normal endosperms reveals that the formation of the transfer cell layer, a tissue formed some 8 days after pollination and responsible for the transport of nutrients into the endosperm, is almost completely suppressed under conditions of paternal genomic excess. The first structural analysis of the development of this tissue in normal and aberrant endosperms is reported, and the implications of regulating the formation of such a tissue by gametically imprinted genes are discussed in the light of current theories on the consequences of genomic imbalance on early embryonic development.",Endosperm; Gametic imprinting; Genomic imprinting; Transfer cells; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029123102

Age?related morphological differentiation among populations of Dactylorhiza traunsteineri (Orchidaceae) in eastern Sweden. ? Nord. J. Bot. 15: 127137. Copenhagen. ISSN 0107055X. Evolution takes time. It is generally believed that for a given species older populations have diversified more than younger ones. To test this hypothesis, two regions in southern Sweden of different age, determined based on land uplift data, were chosen for studying morphological differentiation within the orchid species Dactylorhiza traunsteineri. Individuals from 10 populations in an older region, Gotland, and 11 populations in a younger region, Uppland, were scored for 54 morphological characters. Patterns of morphological variation and the structure of diversity were analyzed using multivariate and simple statistics; the degrees of correspondence among matrices of morphological and environmental factors were calculated. Morphological variation among populations was greater in the older region. This pattern was consistent in all analyses, although more pronounced in the analyses of floral morphology than in analyses of vegetative morphology. Orchid populations on Gotland appear to be relatively old, small and isolated, but genetic drift does not seem to have been important for the differentiation among populations. Other factors, such as habitat heterogeneity, pollinator?mediated selection and accumulation of neutral mutations, were more important. Although populations from Uppland are young, the founder effect does not seem to have been responsible for the low level of diversity among populations. Differentiation appeared to have been limited by low habitat diversity, and a lack of time for genetic drift and for the accumulation of mutations. This study shows that patterns of differentiation within this species are indeed time?dependent. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028982714

Within fig wasps species, it is possible to estimate lifetime reproductive success of foundress wasps as a function of presence or absence of nematode parasitism (virulence). Across species, there is a wide range of host population structures which, in turn, results in a range of opportunities for either horizontal or vertical nematode transmission. Therefore, estimates of virulence can be related to opportunities for transmission across a group of closely related hosts and their parasites. Further, the dynamics of the nematode infections over ecological and short-term evolutionary timescales can be monitored, giving added insight into the interpretation of the virulence estimates. Moreover, several scales of longer term evolutionary relationships are either known directly from fossil evidence or can be inferred from molecular data, providing deeper temporal context for the observed patterns. This combination of attributes permits detailed testing of hypotheses concerning the factors that potentially influence the evolution of virulence in host-parasite systems, and further, population and simulation models of the system that incorporate the parameter estimates can clarify the interpretation of how those factors act. There is little evidence suggesting that intermediate and long-term evolutionary relationships explain current levels of virulence. That is, it appears that virulence can change rapidly relative to speciation events, and that the nematodes do not tend to become benign over time'. Instead, it appears that host population structure can influence the evolution of parasite virulence by affecting the relative opportunities for horizontal to vertical transmission, which, in turn, influences the relative costs and benefits of virulence to the nematodes. At one level, increased opportunities for horizontal transmission decouple the reproductive interests of the individual nematodes from those of the individual hosts that they are directly parasitizing, thereby reducing the cost of virulence to individual nematodes. At another level, increased opportunities of horizontal transmission also increases the relative frequency of hosts infected by multiple strains of nematodes. This promotes the evolution of more virulent forms by increasing the relative importance of within-host competition among nematode strains, thereby favouring strains that eat more host sooner. An interesting property of the fig-nematode systems is that the proportion of infected hosts does not change dramatically through time. This finding implies that there can be considerable negative effects on survival of infected hosts in addition to the previously documented reductions in fecundity of infected foundresses, because the latter are insufficient to account for the observed stability of wasp infection rates. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

A high positive correlation (r = 0·90; P < 0·01) has been revealed between the pollen fertility level and the total rain precipitation during the microgametophytogenesis.

In this context, quantitative estimates of 2n-pollen formation were made in two type of diploid potato populations. One population set consisted of the progeny from diallel crosses of five well-known diploid potato clones (A=US-W 5293.3, B=US-W 5295.7, C=US-W 5337.3, D=US-W 7589.2 and E=772102-37). Another population set was obtained by pollinating three genotypes of Solanum phureja, IvP35, IvP48 and IvP101 with clones A, C and E. It was observed that the behaviour of the parental clones with respect to 2n-pollen grains formation in different environments, such as in Europe and China, was stable. The correlation coefficient between means of 2n-pollen grains frequency of combinations and percentage of genotypes with more than 5% 2n-pollen grains in a given combination were estimated and that between mean and maximum frequency of 2n-pollen grains formation in each combination. The results showed that the former coefficients were significant wheareas the latter were not. The combining ability analysis revealed variation in 2n-pollen grains formation between families. Specific combining ability (SCA) effects contributed much more than general combining ability (GCA) to the variation in 2n-pollen grains formation. The broad-sense heritability of 2n-pollen grains formation was estimated to vary between 0.45 and 0.53 and the narrow-sense heritability was calculated to be 0.15 and 0.20 in the two types of populations. This means that additive variance was relatively low. Two to four genes were estimated to control the inheritance of 2n-pollen grains formation. © 1996, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

We have measured the amount of Japanese cedar pollen in the air, using Durham's standard pollen sampler method, at seven observation sites in Ishikawa prefecture. The total seasonal pollen count was greater at five observation sites in 1992 and 1993, while they were not as high at the other two sites each year. This finding suggests that the pollen count is influenced by the surroundings. Although there was no difference in the duration of the pollination season among the seven observation sites, The daily changes in the pollen count in the Noto area differed from those in the Kaga area. Therefore at least two observation sites, in the Noto and the Kaga areas, are necessary to investigate the daily changes in the pollen count. With regard to pollen counts and meteorological factors, this study was in agreement with previous reports: there was a good correlation between the total seasonal pollen counts and meteorological factors the previous summer, and between the beginning date of pollen scattering and meteorological factors in January and February. We hope that a forecast of Japanese cedar pollen count in Ishikawa prefecture will be started in the near future. © 1995, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

The capacity for accumulation of storage material in endosperms is thought to he partially determined by the extent of cell division and endoreduplication (post?mitotic nuclear DNA synthesis). To gain a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved, we have examined the effect of water deficit on cellular development during the post?fertilization period. Greenhouse?grown maize was subjected to water?limited treatments during rapid cell division [from 1 to 10days after pollination (DAP)] or rapid endoreduplication (9 to 15 DAP). The number of nuclei and the nuclear DNA content were determined with flow cytometry. Water deficit from 1 to 10 DAP substantially decreased the rate of endosperm cell division in apical?region kernels, but had little effect on middle?region endosperms. Rewatcring did not allow cell division to recover in apical?region endosperms. Water deficit from 9 to 15 DAP also decreased cell division in apical?region endosperms. Endoreduplication was not affected by the late treatment in either region of the car, but was inhibited by the early treatment in the apical region. In particular, the proportion of nuclei entering higher DN A?content size classes was reduced. We conclude that cell division is highly responsive to water deficit, whereas endoreduplication is less so. We also conclude that the reduced proportion of nuclei entering higher DNA?content size classes during endoreduplication is indicative of multiple control points in the mitotic and endoreduplication cycles.

The number and sex of breeding individuals in populations are central factors in evolutionary theory, but the quantitative effect of plant population size on pollinator-mediated mating is understudied. We investigated variation in pollen removal (male function) and fruit set (female function) among flowering populations of different size of two bumblebee-and one butterfly-pollinated, rewardless, pollen-limited, hermaphroditic orchid species in Sweden. As the amount of pollen removed from plants by insects (either absolute or proportional) increased, so did the number of pollinations, whereas the proportions of plants with different pollinator-designated functional sex (male, female, hermaphrodite) depended primarily on the ratio between the amount of fruit set and pollen removed within populations. A larger population size was found to have several effects: (1) the total numbers of pollinia removed and fruits set increased; (2) the proportion of pollen removed from plants decreased; (3) the proportion of flowers pollinated decreased in the butterfly-but was not affected in the bumblebee-pollinated species; (4) the ratio between fruits set and pollinia removed increased linearly in the bumblebee-pollinated species but reached a maximum at c. 80 individuals in the butterfly-pollinated species; (5) the numbers of pollinator-designated pure male and hermaphrodite individuals increased; and (6) the variance in pollinium removal, but not fruit set, increased among individuals. These findings empirically verify the basic importance of population size for the mating structure of outcrossing plants, and indicate that selection for female sexual traits is reinforced when population size is smaller while selection for male sexual traits is reinforced when population size is larger. © 1994 Springer Verlag.",Orchids; Pollen waste; Pollinator limitation; Pollinator-mediated mating; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028166057

This holds for mutualisms as diverse as plant associations with mycorrhizal fungi or nitrogen-fixing bacteria, animals and endosymbionts, and obligate plant-pollinator associations1-6. Prevailing models of interspecific cooperation predict that mutualistic interactions are evolutionary stable only when both interacting species possess mechanisms to prevent excessive exploitation3-6. In light of this, it is paradoxical that some of the classical examples of coevolved obligate mutualism seemingly do not meet this criterion. In mutualisms involving seed parasites that actively pollinate their hosts, such as yucca/ yucca moth and fig/fig wasp interactions, there is no apparent means of retaliation on behalf of the plant. Predictions from theory suggest that a cryptic mechanism, such as selective abortion of flowers with heavy egg loads, could stabilize these interactions 4,6-9. Here we present the first empirical evidence that such a mechanism in fact exists in the yucca/yucca moth interaction. A strong nega-tive effect exists between moth egg number and probability of flower retention. Furthermore, we show a strong positive effect between the number of pollinations received and the probability of flower retention. Selective maturation of fruit with low egg loads and high pollen loads provides a mechanism to increase the quantity and possibly quality of seeds produced, and simultaneously select against moths that lay many eggs per flower or provide low-quality pollinations4,6,8,10. Not only can these results explain the stability of this type of interaction, but selection for high-quality pollination also provides a mechanism to help explain the evolution of active pollination among yucca moths. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163505

Although H. minor is a Korean endemic species and most populations of the species are scattered, the species maintains considerably high levels of genetic variation within the species, with a moderate level of variation (14%) found among populations. Nineteen of the 29 putative loci resolved (66%) were polymorphic within the species, the mean number of alleles per locus was 2.10 across all populations and averaged 1.68 within populations. In addition, genetic diversity was a considerably higher (for species and population level, mean estimates of genetic diversity were 0.275 and 0.230, respectively) than the average for other long-lived herbaceous perennials. Indirect estimate of the number of migrants per generation (Nm=1.03, calculated from mean GST) was moderate. Factors contributing to the high levels of genetic diversity found within populations of H. minor include population maintenance via sexual and asexual modes of reproduction, primarily outcrossing breeding system, long generation time, probable ancient polyploid origin of the species, and moderate levels of seed dispersal by wind.

Of the four functional genes identified, only the previously reported Arabidopsis AtS1 gene was expressed specifically in papillar cells and may function in pollination. The remaining three genes, including two novel genes designated ARK2 and ARK3, encode putative receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinases that are expressed predominantly in vegetative tissues. ARK2 promoter activity was detected exclusively in above-ground tissues, specifically in cotyledons, leaves, and sepals, in correlation with the maturation of these structures. ARK3 promoter activity was detected in roots as well as above-ground tissues but was limited to small groups of cells in the root-hypocotyl transition zone and at the base of lateral roots, axillary buds, and pedicels.

These genes encode for zeins of apparent molecular mass (MWapp) 16 and 28 kDa, respectively, which accumulate in the endosperm during seed maturation. Binding assays revealed specific binding of a nuclear protein to three A/T-rich elements, 0.9-1.0 kbp upstream from the initiation codon. One of these elements (41 bp, 88% A/T), present in Zc1, contained a 13 nucleotide duplication. The other two (28 bp, 86% A/T; 42 bp alternating A-T) are consecutive elements in Zc2. Competition experiments strongly suggest that the three elements bind to the same protein. Protein-DNA interaction was detected in endosperm nuclear extracts of 8 to 21 days after pollination (DAP), as well as in 25 DAP embryos and in different tissues from plantlets. The protein factor has an MWapp of ca. 30 kDa. This factor has properties suggesting it is an HMG-like protein.

Pigmentation can also be affected by the shape of epidermal cells, especially those facing prospective pollinators3,4. A conical shape is believed to increase the proportion of incident light that enters the epidermal cells, enhancing light absorption by the floral pigments, and thus the intensity of their colour. We have identified a gene (mixta) that affects the intensity of pigmentation of epidermal cells in Antirrhinum majuspetals. The cells of the corolla lobes fail to differentiate into their normal conical form in mixta mutants. We have cloned the mixta gene by transposon tagging; its sequence reveals that it encodes a Myb-related protein that probably participates in the transcriptional control of epidermal cell shape. © 1994 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028340607

In the anther, competence of pollen to germinate and to produce pollen tubes in situ occurred late in development. In the pistil, competence to support pollen germination and tube growth extended over a broad developmental window, and abundant as well as efficient pollen tube development was observed on pistils at anthesis and for a period of 1-2 days prior to flower opening. In contrast, pollen tube growth on immature pistils was found to proceed at low efficiency, at reduced growth rates, and with lack of directionality. Based on the pattern of pollen tube growth at different stages of pistil maturation, temporally regulated signals emanating from specialized cells of the pistil are inferred to be operative in each of the four identified phases of pollen tube growth. In the stigma and the stylar transmitting tissue, these signals directed the path of intra-specific pollen tubes as well as pollen tubes from another cruciferous genera, Brassica. By contrast, in the ovary, signaling by the ovule was effective only on intra-specific pollen tubes and was thus identified as the basis of inter-specific incompatibility. Furthermore, the acquisition of reproductive function was found to involve, in addition to the induction of a variety of stimulatory signals, a heretofore unrecognized developmental restriction in the capacity of epidermal surfaces of the flower to support pollen tube growth.",Arabidopsis reproductive biology; Incompatibility; Pollen tube development; Pollen-pistil interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028113566

Flowers of some species live less than one day (morning glory), whereas others live for several weeks (orchids)1-3. By viewing floral longevity as a resource allocation strategy2,4, we now incorporate the study of its evolution into the well developed theoretical framework provided by evolu-tionarily stable strategy models that address variation in life history5,6. Flowers must remain open to contribute to plant fitness through ovule fertilization and pollen dissemination, when they require resources for respiratory maintenance and pollinator attraction. Accordingly, floral senescence should occur when the expected fitness gain per unit of floral maintenance investment diminishes to the point where it becomes more profitable to construct a new flower than to maintain an existing one. Our experimental evidence supports floral longevity as an adaptation that balances rates of pollen receipt and removal against the cost of floral maintenance. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163372

These wasps are very sensitive to heat and die at temperatures only a few degrees above ambient. Such temperatures are expected and observed in objects exposed to full sunlight, as fig fruits frequently are. In detailed field and experimental studies of 11 species of Panamanian figs with fruit ranging in size from 5 mm to 50 mm in diameter, we found that both the relative and absolute contribution of transpiration to maintaining non-lethal fruit temperatures increased with fruit size. Small and large fruits reached temperatures of 3 and 8°C, respectively, above air temperature in full sunlight when transpiration was prevented by grease. The temperature reached by large, nontranspiring fruits was sufficient to kill their pollinators. Control fruits which transpired reached temperatures of 2-3°C above air temperature in sunlight, regardless of size. An analysis of the solar energy budget of fruit revealed that large fruits must transpire to maintain tolerable temperatures for the wasps because heat diffusion from fruit to air was too low to balance net radiation in sunlight. By contrast, small fruits do not need to transpire to maintain tolerable temperatures for the pollinators. © 1994 Springer Verlag.",Coevolution; Ficus fruit; Mutualism; Wasp lethal temperatures Energy budgets,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028165155

Pollen that was largely covered with tapetal fluid could not be removed by vibration, whereas dehydrated pollen was easily removed, even without vibration. The late desiccation of A. deliciosa anthers after anthesis meant that pollen removed by vibration depended on the anther maturity. The presence of the droplets gives insects which vibrate while foraging advantages over insects which do not.

This was further supported by in vitro studies which showed that pollen developed significantly shorter pollen tubes at low temperatures and a strong positive correlation between the capacity of male parents to induce seed set in basal ovule positions and the length of pollen tubes in vitro. Female age, determined by days relative to anthesis, was also found to have a significant influence on seed set, i.e. when pollination was delayed until the fifth day of flowering, seed set decreased by an average of 60% when compared to florets pollinated on the first day of anthesis. Pollen age did not influence seed set. Ageing of pollen decreased in vitro germinability, tube elongation and the percentage of pollen tubes with sperm cells.

In Hordeum vulgare cv. Bomi, three antipodal cells are originally developed chalazally but because of differential growth of the embryo sac they soon become laterally situated and their number increases to 35-50 cells and the shape, size and structure of the cells change in the time before as well as after fertilization. The cells persist until about 60-70 h after pollination. At that time, the embryo consists of about 12-15 cells and a cellularization of the nuclear endosperm has started peripherally. The size of nuclei, and especially nucleoli, in the antipodal cells increases tremendously in the investigated period and the amounts of organelles also change. The walls of antipodals are diversified depending on which cells they are separating, and wall invaginations are developed especially between antipodal cells and surrounding nucellar cells in the placental region. The mitochondria appear in various shapes in section view, very often as cups or dumbbells with a rim in the ends containing cristae and a thin cristae-free base. These bases are sometimes stretched out as thin parts and at last a simple parting occurs. Binary fissions of the plastids happen especially in the hours before and just after egg fertilization. ER is extraordinarily well developed in the whole period of investigation and many ribosomes are attached to the membranes. Dictyosomes form numerous vesicles, especially in the antipodals near the nucellar cells in the placental region. These ultrastructural details support the opinion that antipodal cells may play an important role in the embryo sac and are able to be responsible for the supply of nutrition for the whole gametophyte and take part in the supply of nutrition during embryo formation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Antipodal cells; Gramineae; Hordeum vulgare; Ultrastructural changes Functions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028309990

This fraction of the genome is maternally and stoichiometrically inherited. In contrast, some additional restriction fragments specific to regenerated plants display a more complex mode of sexual transmission: one of the additional fragments was stoichiometrically and systematically inherited whereas two others were detected only in certain F1 hybrids. Assuming that the detection, by Southern analysis, of such a fragment in regenerated plants is due to the amplification of a pre-existing substoichiometric molecule generated by the activation of a rare recombination event, our results suggest that the probability of detecting a novel fragment in the F1 hybrids could be determined by the length of the repeated sequence at which recombination occurs. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Mitochondrial DNA variability; Reciprocal crosses; Regeneration; Somatic tissue culture; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028321195

The last three floras have been in continuous contact with hummingbirds since some time early in the Tertiary, and ornithophily is old in this subset of western ornithophilous plants. The Arcto-Tertiary flora had no contact with hummingbirds in Eurasia or in its early history in North America. Ornithophily is a new condition in Arcto-Tertiary plant groups, dating from the first significant contact of these plants with hummingbirds in the Eocene. Buildup of the hummingbird pollination system in the Arcto-Tertiary flora is expected to be gradual and stepwise for several reasons. Ornithophilous plant groups with Arcto-Tertiary affinities in the modern western flora form a graded series with respect to taxonomic rank, taxonomic size, and ecological diversity. The series consists of one large genus (Castilleja), three small genera (Zauschneria, etc.), species groups in several genera (Penstemon, Aquilegia, etc.), single ornithophilous species in otherwise nonornithophilous genera (seven genera - e.g., Pedicularis, Monardella), and ornithophilous races in otherwise nonornithophilous species (known in two species). It is suggested that the gradations in size of the groups approximately reflect stages in their development, with the largest ornithophilous genus being oldest, with single ornithophilous species being relatively recent, and with ornithophilous races being most recent. The observed distribution of numbers of ornithophilous species among genera is in agreement with the expectation of a gradual and stepwise development of ornithophily.",Arcto-Tertiary floristic elements; evolution of mutualism; hummingbird pollination system; Madro-Tertiary floristic elements,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028000032

Almost all the pollinators stayed on both female and hermaphrodite heads only to collect nectar. The female plants of this species may be more specialized in their gender by saving the cost of not only pollen grains but also stamens, and may be maintained by sufficient pollinators in natural populations.

Prior application of self pollen, followed after 2, 4, or 6 h by compatible pollen, was conducted on five genotypes of each of the three style morphs under uniform glasshouse conditions. The greatest reductions in seed set occurred in pollinations of the long-styled (L) morph at the 6 h time interval. Smaller reductions were also found for this treatment in the mid-styled (M) morph. No significant reductions in seed set were observed in the short-styled (S) morph or in the other morphs at shorter time intervals. Observations of pollen germination and pollen tube growth indicated that the lack of inhibitory effects in the S morph may occur because relatively few pollen grains adhered to stigmas in selfpollinations. In the L and M morphs, early germination of self pollen may cause physical clogging of the stigma and style, resulting in a reduced number of compatible pollen tubes in styles. Observations of the structural integrity of styles indicated that prior germination of self pollen resulted in more rapid onset of pistil senescence, particularly in the L morph. These influences may contribute to the morph-specific differences in seed set observed following prior self-pollination of outcrossed flowers. The negative effects of incompatible pollen are likely to be most evident where ecological factors cause delays in the delivery of outcross pollen to stigmas. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Pollen-pistil interference; Prior self-pollination; Self-incompatibility Stylar senescence; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028005585

Wilting of the flowers was accompanied by a loss of water from cells of the upper layer of the petals, leading to their upward folding.

An obvious increase in sensitivity to ethylene could already be detected 4 h after pollination and reached its peak 10 h after pollination.

Flowers influence pollen dispersal and fertilization probabilities by determining the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits (dispensing schedule). We model male reproductive success to identify optimal dispensing schedules, which characteristically involve monotonic increases in the proportion of remaining pollen removed during successive visits. These schedules balance the benefits of restricted removal, which counteracts the diminishing returns associated with animal pollination (e.g. pollinator grooming, local mate competition), with the advantages of increased removal to avoid time-dependent losses in fertilization ability (e.g. pollen precedence, declining viability). Because pollinator availability mediates this balance, the most effective dispensing schedule allows dynamic adjustment of removal to the prevailing frequency of visits experienced by individual plants. As an example of such dynamic removal we demonstrate that the dispensing mechanism of Lupinus sericeus flowers allows facultative adjustment of removal to the interval between visits. Because optimal control of pollen removal can increase a plant's mating opportunities by an order of magnitude, dispensing mechanisms should be a common component of floral design. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.",floral evolution; Lupinus sericeus; male function; pollen dispersal; pollen removal; sexual strategies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028160480

Two bulks of DNA were made in each cross, one from males and one from females, by pooling an equal weight of fresh leaves from each individual contributing to the bulk prior to DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from each bulked sample and from each of the contributing individuals. DNA was also extracted from 14 cultivars of P. vera and from 94 open-pollinated, fewweeks-old P. vera seedlings of unknown sex. Seven hundred different decamer oligonucleotide primers were used to perform DNA amplification, with 1 of these (OPO08) producing a 945 bp amplification band that was present only in the bulked female samples and absent in the bulked male samples of the two crosses. The relationship between band presence and female sex expression was conserved in every individual obtained from the two crosses and in the 14 cultivars unrelated to the crosses.

Although certain patterns that reoccur have been important in the development of ecological theory, the optimization of cost-benefit equations involving two or three trophic levels, each with large numbers of individuals, populations, and species in erratic and complex interactions, produces unexpected and fascinating scenarios. The development of rapid colorimetric and chromatographic analyses for several types of plant allelochemicals, notably certain groups of alkaloids, cardiac and cyanogenic glycosides, phenolics, terpenes, and glucosinolates, has permitted a detailed investigation of the variation and flow of these substances in natural organisms and ecosystems. The results of these analyses, in our hands mostly for pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), do not suggest a straightforward 'classical' choice by the aposematic insect to simply sequester or synthesize its defences. Rather, they reveal a confusing variety of diffuse and complex patterns that become increasingly closer to chaos as they are multiplied across structures, species, sexes, stages, sites, seasons, and selective regimes. We present a model reflecting results of analyses at this chemoecological interface. Depending upon an initial option, involving the recognition (or not) of a plant allelochemical, the herbivore will face thereafter options to ingest it (or not), and then to tolerate and absorb (or detoxify and excrete), modify (or not), passively, actively or selectively accumulate, turn over (or not), distribute (or concentrate), and use this compound in a variety of growth, defense, or reproductive functions. The herbivore can also quantitatively or qualitatively regulate the intensity or dispersion of its attack on the plant tissues, in order to modify feedback loops of selection on the plant and its chemicals which exist in most of the earlier steps, or those with its predators and parasites that occur in the later ones. Options that lead to mutualism through positive feedback loops will tend to accumulate and become rapidly fixed by natural selection. Additional variations and 'anomalies' such as automimicry, chemical mimicry, sexual dimorphism and communication, selective sequestration and passing-up of allelochemicals, special glands and structures, and synergism effects, are among the secondary complications of this model that have occupied much thought, time, experimental labor, and polemical space in chemical ecology journals and meetings. Examination of the tendencies and results at various points in the model can be used to explain these features and to make further predictions, plan experiments, and devise activity-based bioassays and new chemical analyses. These may lead some day to new and more robust visions of the major patterns of chemical transfer at this widespread and important natural interface. © 1995 Birkhäuser Verlag.",aposematism; aristolactams; aristolochic acids; cardenolides; coevolution; cyanogenic glycosides; magnoflorine; mimicry; mutualism; palatability spectrum; pheromones; plant-herbivore interface; pollination; predation; pyrrolizidine alkaloids; sequestration; sesquiterpenes; tropane alkaloids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005316745

The objectives of this study for ex-situ conservation of maize (Zea mays L.) are to review and describe: (1) practical regeneration methods that are based on population genetic theory; (2) practical problems encountered in choosing core subsets of a maize collection. Whenever possible, regeneration procedures should control the number of pollen parents (male gametes; through controlled hand pollination) and the number of female parent gametes (by harvesting equal numbers of kernels from each seed plant). When the number of pollen and seed parents are controlled during regeneration, the effective population size (Ne) is twice the size of the original population (N). Examples of practical methods for controlling the number of male and female parents are presented. The procedure involves random-paired plant crosses and taking equal numbers of seeds from each maize ear. To form a core subset, accessions of a maize race are subdivided through a stratified sampling procedure. Delineation of a core subset from a Tuxpeño racial collection is described as an example. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028140971

Fertilization occurs during the first 24 h after pollination. The endosperm is a coenocyte, which is eventually consumed by the embryo. By 10 DAP the inner integument is degraded and the outer integument adjoins the embryo sac boundary. The heart-shaped embryo approaches the embryo sac boundary at two sites, which here are named contact zones. Small integument cells in the neighbourhood of the first formed contact zones become separated by prominent intercellular spaces. A heterogenous scattering material, probably representing secretion products accumulates in these spaces. By 14-16 DAP the integument exudate disappears, and the suspensor degenerates. As the contact zones increase in size, wall ingrowths form a bridging network in the narrow space between the embryo sac boundary and the extra-embryonic part of the endosperm wall. The epidermal cells of the embryo separate adjacent to these zones, and develop conspicuous wall ingrowths. At 20 DAP vacuoles showing various stages in formation of protein bodies appear in the cells of the embryo.","Vicia faba, broad beans, ovule, seed, nutrient transport",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028011336

An analysis of sexual systems and temporal variation of sex expression showed that of 29 monocot species, 14 (48.3%) were hermaphrodite and adichogamous, 14 (48.3%) monoecious and dichogamous, and one (3.4%) dioecious. The combination of monoecy and dichogamy prevented autogamy in 11 (91.7%) of the 12 self-compatible and monoecious species; one (8.3%) was autogamous. Of all species, 24 (82.8%) were obligate outbreeders, 2 (6.9%) spontaneously autogamous, and 3 (10.3%) partially autogamous. Ovule and flower abortion were not significantly different between the different groups. Pollen-ovule ratio was significantly different between monoecious and hermaphrodite species. The number of pollen grains and ovules per flower and the pollen-ovule ratio were variable among various pollination types. The average pollen-ovule ratio was higher in beetle-, dipteran-, and wind-pollinated species than in bee-, bird-, and bat-pollinated species. The first three pollination types were restricted to monoecious species, and the second three groups were restricted to hermaphrodite species. Of 33 plant species investigated, 12 (36.4%) displayed vegetative reproduction.

A method is described for isolation of deficiencies in the Arabidopsis genome which encompass specific loci and other extended chromosomal regions. The technique employs pollen mutagenized by ?-irradiation to pollinate marker lines homozygous for recessive mutations. Deficiencies at specific loci were detected by screening for marker phenotypes in the F1. Screening for lethal mutations in the F1/F2 confirmed specific deficiencies and revealed other deficiencies that did not overlap the marker loci. Further evidence for such mutations was provided by distorted F2 segregation of the chromosomal markers linked to putative deficiencies.

The flowers of both sexes are dimorphic: the female flower has a vestigial calyx; the male flower consists only of a calyx that opens at anthesis. The anthers always dehisce after anthesis. The anthesis of male flowers seems to be temperature dependent, whereas anther dehiscence is related to relative humidity. The pollen grains vary in volume according to the season: they are smaller when relative humidity is low and vice versa. They always decrease in volume after anther dehiscence and have the capacity to vary in volume and reach equilibrium with a changing environment. Viability is high, but may drop suddenly during heavy rain or hail that damage the exposed male flowers. The number of pollen grains per stigma varies from 0 to 300. The data is discussed in relation to the type of pollination and environmental characteristics.","Mercurialis annua, dioecism, anthesis, anther dehiscence, pollen volume, pollen viability, anemophilous pollination, pollination ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028039527

The progeny (after self-pollination) of 14 transformed plants, which expressed GUS above a threshold of 1 nmol/min per mg protein, were found to fall into two distinct groups. In the seedlings of 10 lines (group A) GUS expression was enhanced by exposure to light. In 4 lines of this group maintenance for 3 days in the dark eliminated GUS activity. The seedlings of group B expressed GUS regardless of the light/dark regime. In plants of group A, GUS expression was also developmentally regulated: high GUS activity in young leaves, low activity in mature leaves and no activity in the roots. The results suggest that this short chloroplastic Cu,Zn SOD promoter contains motifs for developmental (spatial) regulation as well as motifs responsive to light (or to oxygen radicals resulting from light-driven photosynthesis). © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",gene regulation; light; SOD; tobacco; wounding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028486025

Cultivars have been developed for many growing regions, however little is known about genetic diversity in B. napus germ plasm. The purpose of the research presented here was to study the genetic diversity and relationships of B. napus accessions using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Eighty three B. napus accessions were screened using 43 genomic DNA clones which revealed 161 polymorphic fragments. Each accession was uniquely identified by the markers with the exception of the near-isogenic cvs 'Triton' and 'Tower'. The RFLP data were analyzed by cluster analysis of similarity coefficients and by principal component analysis. Overall, there were three major groups of cultivars. The first group included only spring accessions, the second mostly winter accessions and the third, rutabagas and oilseed rape accessions from China and Japan. These results indicate that within B. napus, winter and spring cultivars represent genetically distinct groups. The grouping of accessions by cluster analysis was generally consistent with known pedigrees. This consistency included the grouping of lines derived both by backcrossing or self-pollination with their parents. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Genetic diversity; Oilseed rape; Restriction fragment length polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028005248

Spring climatic conditions induced significantly longer ovaries at anthesis with an autonomous fruit set as in natural parthenocarpy. Autumn climatic conditions induced smaller ovaries with fruit set influenced by the pollination stage of the female flower. These differences involve, during fruit development, a regulation of the empty seed number especially at both ends of female receptivity period. Indeed, seasons have no effect on ovule receptivity and fertility measured by full seed number. It is supposed that priority is given to seeds with an embryo in the competition for limited maternal resources in spring as well as in autumn. In spring, the use of irradiated pollen during the whole female receptivity period did not modify the seed set profile. Moreover, a cytological study of 6-day-old ovules pollinated by irradiated pollen has revealed a similar precocious embryogenesis compared to the control. In cucumber, pollination with irradiated pollen involves stenospermocarpy rather than 'induced parthenocarpy.'

The purpose of the investigation was to determine the frequency of cross-pollination between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants at different distances, using a kanamycin resistnace transgene (nptII) as a selectable marker. All potato plants were from the variety Désirée. Non-transgenic potato plants, used as potential recipients of transgene-containing pollen, were planted in 12 sub-plots, at distances of 0-20 m from the nearest transgenic potato plants. Seeds harvested from the non-transgenic plants were screened for resistance to kanamycin, and molecular methods were used to confirm that resistant progeny contained the nptII gene. Where transgenic and non-transgenic potato plants were in alternate rows (leaves touching), 24% of seedlings from the non-transgenic parent plants were kanamycin-resistant. Comparable seedlings from plants at up to 3 m distance had a resistance frequency of 2%, at 10 m the frequency was 0.017% and at 20 m no resistant progeny were observed. Plants of the weed species S. dulcamara and S. nigrum were also planted close to the transgenic potatoes to test for evidence of hybridization, and no kanamycin-resistant seedlings were observed among progeny from S. dulcamara and S. nigrum. This investigation provided evidence that the extent of gene dispersal from transgenic potatoes to non-transgenic potatoes falls markedly with increasing distance, and is negligible at 10 m. There was, also, no evidence of transgene movement from potato to S. dulcamara and S. nigrum under field conditions. These data will be valuable in defining genetic isolation procedures for the early field evaluation and the use of novel transgenic potato genotypes. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.",gene transfer; genetic isolation; genetic modification; risk assessment; Solanum tuberosum; transformation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028010498

We demonstrate, by analysing O2 mRNAs in different organs of maize plants, that the O2 gene is only active in the endosperm. Its transcription is precisely controlled during seed development: O2 mRNAs are first detected 10 days after pollination and accumulate in the endosperm over a period of 20 days. When introduced into tobacco plants, the O2 promoter directs the expression of the ?-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in endosperm, but also in the embryo, cotyledons and pollen. The first 185 by of the O2 promoter is sufficient for developmentally regulated expression in tobacco seeds. A distinct cis-acting element, located between positions -185 and -520, directs expression in the cotyledons of tobacco seedlings.

In the present study, yield and growth data were collected on 12 southwestern US maize open-pollinated populations. These populations, originally cultivated by the Indians of the southwestern US for both human and animal consumption and adapted to various altitudes, were grown in replicated plots at the University of Illinois Agronomy-Plant Pathology South Farm. All growth and yield parameters were found to be negatively correlated with nuclear DNA amount. The negative correlations of nuclear DNA amount and growth parameters were more pronounced at 60 days after planting (DAP) than 30 DAP. Agronomically-important yield parameters, such as ear or seed weight and seed number per plant, also exhibited a significant negative correlations with nuclear DNA amount. These correlations demonstrate how the nucleotype may exhibit a high degree of influence on the agronomic phenotype. Although the results presented here represent only three replications at one location in 1 year, the observations noted suggest that nucleotype plays an integral role in determining the agronomic performance of maize.

Some domesticated plants (C. argyrosperma and C. moschata) expressed cucurbitacin bitterness whereas some sympatric free-living plants produced non-bitter fruits. This reversal of typical cucurbitacin expression suggested gene flow between crop and weed at the site. Isozyme analysis provided little insight as to taxa involved in gene exchange, although progeny from a single free-living plant carried IDH allozymes that are associated with Mexican landraces of C. pepo. Synthetic hybridization revealed that fertile F, hybrids are produced from crosses involving C. fraterna as the pistillate parent and C. argyrosperma as the staminate parent. Interspecific crop/weed hybrids can produce viable progeny upon self-pollination or backcrossingto either parent, andF2 families display normal allozyme segregation. Hybrid fertility, as indicated by pollen stainability, increases in progeny produced by backcrossingfrom the C. argyrosperma parent. Interspecific hybridfertility represents a potential for crop/weed gene flow that would be realized under natural conditions if pollen flow occurs between C. fraterna and C. argyrosperma in the fields of Tamaulipas. Oligolectic ""squash bees"" (Teponapis), efficient Cucurbita pollen vectors, are present at the site.

Before fertilization, the synergid is a highly polarized cell with dense longitudinally aligned arrays of microtubules adjacent to the filiform apparatus at the micropylar end of the cell associated with major organelles. The cytoskeleton of the central cell is less polarized, with dense cortical microtubules in the micropylar and chalazal regions and looser, longitudinally oriented cortical microtubules in the lateral region. In the synergid and central cell, F-actin is frequently found at the surface of the organelles and co-localizes with either single microtubules or microtubule bundles. Egg cell microtubules are frequently cortical, randomly oriented and more abundant at the chalazal end of the cell; actin filaments are associated with microtubules and the cortex of the egg cell. At 48 h after pollination and before the pollen tube arrives, the onset of degeneration is evident in one of the two synergids: the electron density of cytoplasmic organelles and the ground cytoplasm increases and the nucleus becomes distorted. Although synergids otherwise remain intact, the vacuole collapses and organelles degenerate rapidly after pollen-tube entry. Abundant electron-dense material extends from the degenerated synergid into intercellular spaces at the chalazal end of the synergid and between the synergids, egg and central cell. Rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-actin immunogold labeling reveal that electron-dense aggregates in this region contain abundant actin forming two distinct bands termed ""coronas"". This actin is part of a mechanism in the egg apparatus which appears to precisely position and facilitate the access of male gametes to the egg and central cell for fusion. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Actin; Cytoskeleton; Embryo sac; Fertilization; Microtubule; Nicotiana; Synergid degeneration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028056181

Temporal and morphological observations revealed distinct differences of pollen tube behavior among these incongruous crosses. Pollen tubes of N. repanda were arrested in stigma and those of N. rustica in the middle of the style. On the other hand, pollen tubes of N. trigonophylla continued growing at a slow rate. Tubes of N. repanda and N. rustica showed morphological abnormalities such as swelling, thick wall, and irregular callose deposition. In addition, tubes of N. rustica often elongated in reverse direction and wound about in the middle of the style. Although the tubes of N. trigonophylla were apparently normal in morphology, they were distributed throughout the transmitting tissue, differing from the self-pollination of N. tabacum in which they were confined to the peripheral region of it. The diversity of pollen tube behavior indicates that physiological causes of incongruity are different among the three crosses.

When foraging, bees do not sample flowers randomly as they encounter them, but rather they exhibit a strong preference for one species of flower, and will ignore other species that they encounter. The species favoured depends on previous foraging success: ifa species of flower has previously provided a high reward, it will be favoured to the exclusion of others. Various models have been developed to describe the optimal foraging pattern of flower feeding insects, which explain, at least in part, observed behaviour. However, they do not consider the importance consequences of flower constancy for competition between plants dependant upon insects for pollination. Bees are most likely to favour a common species which they encounter frequently, and will fly directly between individuals of the favoured species, and thus provide efficient pollination. Conversely, they are unlikely to develop a preference for a scarce flower which necessarily is rarely encountered. A simple two-flower species model is developed which predicts the proportion of insects which will favour each of the two species for particular flower densities, assuming that individual insects favour the species which provides them with the greatest reward per time. The model predicts that scarce plant species will receive no pollinators below a threshold density of reward, and that scarce plants must provide a relatively huge reward per flower to achieve pollination. The threshold is lowered at high insect densities when the reward offered by the more common species becomes depleted. The implications of flower constancy to plant communities are discussed. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028166052

Pollination experiments indicated that C. ambigua is self-incompatible and that seed set was significantly affected by the behavior of the pollinating queens. Plants with larger inflorescences were visited more often than those with fewer flowers. Fecundity also increased with increasing size of inflorescences.

However, the role of terpenoid mixtures, either constitutive or induced, their intraspecific qualitative and quantitative compositional variation, and their dosage-dependent effects are emphasized in subsequent discussions. It is suggested that little previous attention to these characteristics may have contributed to terpenoids having been misrepresented in some chemical defense theories. Selected phytocentric examples of terpenoid interactions are presented: (1) defense against generalist and specialist insect and mammalian herbivores, (2) defense against insect-vectored fungi and potentially pathogenic endophytic fungi, (3) attraction of entomophages and pollinators, (4) allelopathic effects that inhibit seed germination and soil bacteria, and (5) interaction with reactive troposphere gases. The results are integrated by discussing how these terpenoids may be contributing factors in determining some properties of terrestrial plant communities and ecosystems. A terrestrial phytocentric approach is necessitated due to the magnitude and scope of terpenoid interactions.

For the B. napus-R. raphanistrum hybrids, high chromosome pairing and the presence of multivalents (in 9.16% of the pollen mother cells) indicate that recombination is possible between chromosomes of different genomes.

Aquilegia is also known for the large degree of intercompatibility among its species, which has led to the suggestion that the genus has arisen recently. However, intercompatibility does not always imply recent divergence and the widespread distribution pattern of the genus has suggested an older age. We constructed phylogenies for Aquilegia plus its close relatives by using nucleotide sequence data from both nuclear and chloroplast DNA. The sequence data averaged over 1250 bp per species. Among the 14 columbine species sampled from Europe, Asia, and North America only 16-bp changes and one insertion/deletion event were detected. In contrast, related genera had from 3 to 45 times this level of variation. The phylogenies derived from the chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences were highly concordant and suggest that the columbines are the result of a recent, rapid radiation. In contrast to other examples of species flocks, Aquilegia has radiated on a widespread geographical scale.

The recombinant cytoplasmic domain of PRK1 autophosphorylated on serine and tyrosine, suggesting that PRK1 may be a dual-specificity kinase. Monospecific immune serum to the recombinant extracellular domain of PRK1 detected a 69-kD protein in microsomal membranes of pollen and pollen tubes. The characteristics of PRK1 suggest that it may play a role in signal transduction events during pollen development and/or pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028427876

Box 16, 6700 AA Wageningen, The Netherlands","Exudate production in the pistil of Lilium longiflorum was studied in relation to pollen tube growth, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. In contrast with conventional fixation for SEM, during which the exudate of L. longiflorum largely washes away, the exudate remains present through freezing in case of cryo-SEM. Using the latter method we observed that exudate production on the stigma and in the style started before anthesis. Just underneath the stigma the exudate was first accumulated at the top of each secretory cell, followed by a merging of those accumulations as exudate production proceeded. Exudate is also produced by the placenta. It was however not possible to determine whether any of this fluid originated from the micropyle. Apart from the cell shape and the cuticle present in between the secretory cells, the ultrastructure of the secretory cells covering the placenta was comparable to those of the stylar canal. The transfer wall of the secretory cells of the placenta originated from fusing Golgi vesicles but the endoplasmic reticulum seemed to have an important role as well. After pollination the pollen tubes grew across the stigma and entered the style through one of the slits in the three stigma lobes. The pollen tubes grew straight downward through the style and were covered by exudate. As the pollen tubes approached the ovary their growth was restricted to the areas with secretory cells. In the cavity the pollen tubes formed a bundle and they bent from this bundle in between the ovules towards the micropylar side. There they bent again to stay close to the secretory cells. After bud pollination the pollen tube growth was retarded. Later arriving pollen tubes had a tendency to grow close to the secretory cells of the style, which resulted in a growth between these cells and preceding pollen tubes. If there was still a little exudate produced, it resulted in a lifting up of the pollen tubes, out of the exudate. The relationship between exudate production and pollen tube growth is discussed. Both the speed and the guidance of the pollen tube seemed determined by the properties of the exudate.","Cryo-scanning electron microscopy, exudate, Lilium longiflorum, lily, ovary, pollination, pollen tube growth, secretory cell, stigma, style",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028005813

Both traits appear to be highly heritable and, as expected, were strongly genetically correlated, with narrow-sense individual heritabilities near 0.50. Expected gain in the first generation following individual selection in the trials of one tree in 10 for either trait is about 25-32%. Genetic correlations between growth traits and 1,8-cineole yield were small. This indicates that both traits might be improved concurrently thus enhancing the economics of growing Petford E. camaldulensis for wood and medicinal oil. However, the presence of moderate and unfavourable genetic correlations between growth traits and total yield of monoterpenes warrants further study. It was not possible to gauge the significance of apparent family × site interaction for 1,8-cineole yield in this study. However, a test of rank correlation showed an association (Ip<0.01) between family rankings on each site and the highest-yielding trees on both sites came from the same families.

Interspecific hybrids between three breeding lines of O. sativa (2n=24, AA) and four accessions of O. australiensis (2n=24, EE) were obtained through embryo rescue. The crossability ranged from 0.25% to 0.90%. The mean frequency of bivalents at diakinesis/metaphase I in F1 hybrids (AE) was 2.29 to 4.85 with a range of 0-8 bivalents. F1 hybrids were completely male sterile. We did not obtain any BC1 progenies even after pollinating 20,234 spikelets of AE hybrids with O. sativa pollen. We crossed the artificially induced autotetraploid of an elite breeding line (IR31917-45-3-2) with O. australiensis (Acc. 100882) and, following embryo rescue, produced six F1 hybrid plants (AAE). These triploid hybrids were backcrossed to O. sativa. The chromosome number of 16 BC1 plants varied from 28 to 31, and all were male sterile. BC2 plants had 24-28 chromosomes. Eight monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) having a 2n chromosome complement of O. sativa and one chromosome of O. australiensis were selected from the BC2 F2 progenies. The MAALs resembled the primary trisomies of O. sativa in morphology, and on the basis of this morphological similarity the MAALs were designated as MAAL-1, -4, -5, -7, -9, -10, -11, and -12. The identity of the alien chromosome was verified at the pachytene stage of meiosis. The alien chromosomes paired with the homoeologous pairs to form trivalents at a frequency of 13.2% to 24.0% at diakinesis and 7.5% to 18.5% at metaphase I. The female transmission rates of alien chromosomes varied from 4.2% to 37.2%, whereas three of the eight MAALs transmitted the alien chromosome through the male gametes. BC2 progenies consisting of disomic and aneuploid plants were examined for the presence of O. australiensis traits. Alien introgression was detected for morphological traits, such as long awns, earliness, and Amp-3 and Est-2 allozymes. Of the 600 BC2 F4 progenies 4 were resistant to BPH and 1 to race 6 of BB. F3 segregation data suggest that earliness is a recessive trait and that BPH resistance is monogenic recessive in two of the four lines but controlled by a dominant gene in the other two lines. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Alien gene transfer; Introgression; Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs); O. australiensis; Oryza sativa; Resistance to bacterial blight; Resistance to brown planthopper; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027951267

The columbine genus Aquilegia contains species that have been used as classic examples of reproductive isolation due to ecological and floral factors. In this analysis Aquilegia formosa, Aquilegia pubescens, and natural hybrid populations between these two species were assayed for genetic and morphological variation. Clinal variation was evident for three 'random amplified polymorphic DNA' loci and five morphological characters along a transect extending from a lower altitude A. formosa population, through an intermediate hybrid population, to a higher altitude A. pubescens population. Similar clinal variation was also discovered for a transect that included A. formosa-like, hybrid, and A. pubescens-like populations at a single elevation. The change in the frequency of both sets of markers was closely associated with change in habitat. The molecular markers indicate the presence of bidirectional introgression between these two species. In contrast, there was apparently selection against introgression of four of the five alternate floral characters. Selection against the incorporation of floral characters from one species into the other species was suggested by the introgression of the DNA markers with little or no introgression of the four floral characters. These findings suggest the importance of adaptations associated with both pollination syndromes and habitat preference on species integrity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028223252

Such intensive nectar-feeding by monkeys of up to 8 kg body weight probably developed in these basically frugivorous primates as an alternative strategy to cope with a shortage of fleshy fruits. This would have been possible due to the high density of the plant species, the synchrony and abundance of its flowering (Fig. 2), and the large size of the nectar drop and its nutritional value. Patterns of monkey movements among Daniellia trees show that one flowering tree may receive up to 10 species visits and 30 individual visits per day, for a total of up to 141 min. (Table 1). A monkey troop can visit 12 trees in succession over less than 3 h (Fig. 4). This suggests that monkeys are able to promote pollen transfer both among flowers of the same tree and between conspecific trees. The individual tree fruiting index is positively correlated with its flowering index and with the amount of visits by monkeys, indicating at least that monkeys do not inhibit the reproductive ability of flowers (Fig. 5). These results suggest that monkeys can be considered as a guild of effective pollinators. Long-term coevolution between the plant and its present-day pollinators seems unlikely, and we suggest that monkeys replaced other pollinators, such as Lepidoptera. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that tubular flowers adapted for pollination by Lepidoptera are found in affine species of the same genus and of affine genera, the latter being known to be pollinated by these insects. In contrast, D. pynaertii flowers typically meet the pollination syndrome currently defined for attracting large mammals: notably conspicuousness and open morphology of the flowers, nectar colour and abundance. These characteristics suggest that coadaptation between monkeys and plant or at least one-sided adaptation has operated. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Caesalpinioideae; Feeding ecology; Monkeys; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028176610

Overall, 91% of the resistant seeds resulted from the first four flowers that were visited after the bumblebee left the transgenic plant, and none was found beyond the 14th successively visited flower.

Fruit quantity and quality was assessed following self-and outcross-pollination manipulations. Twenty percent of outcrossed flowers set fruit, compared to only 1% of flowers fertilized with self-pollen. Fruits produced by self-fertilization were 72% of the weight of cross-fertilized fruits. Fruits produced by self-fertilization were significantly fewer in number and lighter than fruits following natural pollination of unmanipulated flowers (17% fruit set), but outcrossed and naturally pollinated fruits were equivalent. Flower to fruit demography suggested that a post-zygotic mechanism may be preferentially selecting the most vigorous zygote genotypes, as ovary abscission occurs mostly between 4 and 30 weeks after pollination, regardless of pollen source. Self-pollen tube growth was found to be inhibited within the styly, while pollen tubes were found in the ovary for 50% of all outcrossed flowers. These data suggest that a pre-zygotic ""pseudo"" self-incompatibility mechanism is the cause of low fruit set following self-pollination. The breeding system of P. mollis was found to promote outbreeding, with an emphasis on flexibility and post-zygotic choice following pre-zygotic ""pseudo"" self-incompatibility. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding systems; Mate choice; Pollen tubes; Pollination manipulations; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028160033

Flowering extends from the second week of May to early July. The small, whitegreenish, entomophilous flowers are incompletely protandrous and last 8-10 days, but pollen transfer takes place only on days 1-3. A very weak, pleasant odour along with nectar and pollen attract over 45 insect species, of which 21 are probable pollinators. These are mainly Diptera but also include Hymenoptera and the unusual (as flower visitors)Mecoptera. Reproduction is exclusively sexual and strictly xenogamous, with pollen transfer depending solely on insect vectors. Although flower morphology and individual flower phenology do not fully prevent self-pollination, and geitonogamy can easily take place, the level of autogamy was negligible. Therefore, some self-incompatibility mechanism is operative in this species. Only 2.8% of open-pollinated flowers set fruit. At the flower level, fruit initiation was apparently limited by availability of cross-pollen, which in turn seemed influenced by the structure of the population. The seed/ovule ratio in ripe fruits was ca. 50%. Predispersal (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming filled seeds) was 1.42%. For mature individuals this corresponded to ca. 430 to 1560 potential offspring per year. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Coleoptera; Diptera; Frangula; Hymenoptera; Mecoptera; phenology; pollination biology; protandry; reproductive success; Rhamnaceae; self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028312313

Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, United States","It is widely believed that mutualisms, interspecific interactions that benefit both species, have been grossly neglected relative to their true importance in nature. I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22 % of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90 % of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028595244

During this interval, the fraction of lipid contributed by linoleic and palmitic acids decreased, and the fraction contributed by stearic and oleic acids increased. After 115 DAP, stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids accumulated at nearly the same rate, and the fatty-acid composition resembled that of cocoa butter. The ratio of C-18 unsaturated fatty acids to stearic acid decreased between 95 and 115 DAP, then leveled-off. Thus, lipid composition changed from membrane-like to cocoa-butter-like in only 20 d out of the 170 d required for embryos to reach maturity. Levels of stearoyl-ACP desaturase were determined by Western blot analyses using antibodies to avocado stearoyl-ACP desaturase. Western blots revealed a single 38-kDa band - corresponding to the expected size of the stearoyl-ACP-desaturase monomer - in extracts from 95- and 105-DAP embryos. Although the amount of stearoyl-ACP-desaturase protein was 2.3-fold higher at 95 than at 105 DAP when equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane, no difference in the abundance of stearoyl-ACP desaturase was observed when the protein loaded per lane was standardized for equal amounts of DNA. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Cocoa butter; Fatty acid biosynthesis; Stearoyl-ACP desaturase; Theobroma (fatty acids); Triacylglycerol (plant),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028119444

Offspring of flies feed solely on thistle seeds and seed production is pollen-limited. Thus, female flies risk reduced offspring fitness when committing large clutches to hosts (female flower heads) occurring in localities where male plants are locally absent. We therefore predict that attacked hosts will contain fewer eggs in such localities, a prediction that is consistent with data obtained in the field: large clutches are never laid in flower heads in low-pollination localities. However, larvae reared from such low-quality hosts are significantly smaller on average and will therefore carry smaller egg loads as adults. Small clutches in poor-quality hosts may thus be an expression of lower per-adult fecundity. Nevertheless, sufficient numbers of large, fecund flies are produced in low-pollination localities to make this last explanation less convincing. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.",Canada thistle; pollen limitation; tephritid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163463

Loss of SI in self-compatible (SC) mutants was associated with a significantly decreased basic phosphorylation activity in untreated pollen grains as compared to SI genotypes.

In compatible intermorph pollination, pollen tubes were found at the base of the transmitting tract of the style at 8 h and 24 h after pollination in both the pin and thrum morphs. With thrum flowers, selfing resulted in pollen tubes being uniformly arrested at the junction between the stigmatic and stylar tissues. Penetration of pollen tubes into the upper portion of style was observed in thrum intramorph pollination and, when the second member was treated as the gynoecial tissue under the same pollination, penetration of tubes was further enhanced. Pin flowers, on selfing, resulted in pollen tube penetration farther down the style than was the case with thrum selfing. Intramorph pollination of pin morph behaved in a similar manner to selfing and was not affected by genotypes. Beside the stamen-style dimorphism, the receptive surface of the cob stigma was larger in pin than thrum flowers.

The introduction of major genes for resistance from the wild species S. demissum into potato cultivars is the earliest example of breeding for resistance using wild germplasm in this crop. Eleven resistance alleles (R genes) are known, differing in the recognition of corresponding avirulence alleles of the fungus. The number of R loci, their positions on the genetic map and the allelic relationships between different R variants are not known, except that the R1 locus has been mapped to potato chromosome V The objective of this work was the further genetic analysis of different R alleles in potato. Tetraploid potato cultivars carrying R alleles were reduced to the diploid level by inducing haploid parthenogenetic development of 2 n female gametes. Of the 157 isolated primary dihaploids, 7 set seeds and carried the resistance alleles R1, R3 and R10 either individually or in combinations. Independent segregation of the dominant R1 and R3 alleles was demonstrated in two F1 populations of crosses among a dihaploid clone carrying R1 plus R3 and susceptible pollinators. Distorted segregation in favour of susceptibility was found for the R3 allele in 15 of 18 F1 populations analysed, whereas the RI allele segregated with a 1:1 ratio as expected in five F1 populations. The mode of inheritance of the R10 allele could not be deduced as only very few F1 hybrids bearing R10 were obtained.

From progeny of crosses with Stella as pollinator, 56% (Vittoria × Stella) and 46% (Schüttler × Stella) of the seedlings were self-compatible, of which 14 were high yielding with good fruit size and quality. From the data recorded it can be concluded:fruit set is a recessive character; only 5 to 20% of very good yielding seedlings were obtained in different progeny, even if the parental plants were both very good croppers. Fruit juice and skin colour was in most progenies 'black' even if they were from combinations with 'white' varieties, e.g., Merton Glory or Schüttler. Only from the combination Schiittler ('white') × Stella ('black'), 50% of the seedlings were 'white'; Stella therefore is heterozygous for the character of fruit juice and skin colour. Fruit size is evenly distributed in progeny with respect to the fruit size of their parent plants. Abscission layer formation and non-bleeding is a genetically complex character. In combinations where both parent plants formed fruits with complete abscission layers and which were not bleeding after fruit removal from the stalk, this character was inherited only to 50% (Vittoria × Schüttler) or 85% (Vittoria × Frühe von der Weid) in the progeny. For the genetical control of this character further studies are necessary. Bacterial canker susceptibility was evenly distributed in seedlings from all combinations even if the highly resistant cv. Vittoria was used as one parent plant, thereby not confirming the expected results of a higher proportion of resistant seedlings from combinations with Vittoria. Flowering and harvest time of the seedlings from different combinations was within the range of the parent plants. Only in the combination of Vittoria × Stella (mid-to late-ripening season) one seedling out of 99 was found to form ripe fruits two weeks earlier than the parental plants.

The most important restrictions were seed set, embryo germination and green plant recovery from germinated embryos. The efficiency of green plant production was strongly influenced by irradiation dose, picking time and quality of the irradiated pollen. 250 Gy pollen was more efficient for green plant production than 500 Gy pollen. Using 250 Gy pollen with reduced germination capacity resulted in a five-fold lower green plant yield. Delaying picking of the fruits (140 instead of 70 days after pollination) had a significant positive effect. Up to 20 plants per 1000 pollinated flowers, showing no expression of a marker gene present in the pollen parent, were obtained in some treatments. Induction efficiency was high when seed weight was high. This offers the possibility of selecting seeds with the best chances for haploid plant production. Heavy seeds generally contained visual normal developed embryos, which germinated better than those from lighter seeds and gave normal plant development. Delayed picking increased the proportion of large seeds, suggesting that pollination with irradiated pollen retards embryo development. From treatments with irradiated pollen of poor quality more small seeds were harvested. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Apple; haploid induction; Malus domestica; parthenogenesis in situ; picking time; pollen irradiation; pollen quality; seed selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249167933

Out of the 2400 accessions now collected, one quarter was recovered from old public collections, and three quarters came from farms or gardens. The initial intention was to screen the material for disease resistance and other characters of agronomic interest with a view to using the best cultivars as breeding parents. However, as the collection developed, genetic resources conservation also became an objective per se. The collection presently contains 1150 apple, 850 pear and 300 plum accessions, and smaller numbers of other fruit species. Each accession is evaluated in an experimental orchard for at least ten years. In view of the growing public interest in old fruit-tree cultivars, the Plant Pathology Station has for several years been releasing to the nursery trade the better cultivars emerging from the evaluation, namely nine apple and four plum cultivars, and one peach cultivar. The principal features of the apple cultivars are presented in this paper. Since 1988, old apple and plum cultivars have been being used at the Station as parents in a breeding programme, with both controlled and open pollination. In some instances, old apple cultivars have also been crossed with a modern parent carrying the Vf gene for scab resistance.

The protein sequence deduced from the pG31 transcript shows substantial sequence homologies to bacterial glucose dehydrogenase and ribitol dehydrogenase. Biochemical analysis indicates that glucose dehydrogenase activity is present in protein extracts from embroys 18d after pollination.

The highly elongate pollinaria become attached to the underside of the pollinator's thorax. The bees showed strong fidelity towards the orchid, despite the lack of nectar in its flowers. The orchid does not appear to mimic other rewarding species. It was concluded that the pollination system of D. tenuifolia depends on exploitation of instinctive foraging and territorial behaviour of male megachilid bees. The fruiting success of D. tenuifolia at the study site was pollinator?limited as supplementary hand?pollinations resulted in a two?fold increase in the percentage of flowers which set fruit.

For studies of evolution by sexual selection, it is especially important to determine the degree to which variation in mating success is dictated by environmental versus genetic variation. It is extremely difficult to discriminate between male-male competition and female choice during postpollination interactions, but male-male competition commonly occurs during pollination itself. Male-male competition will reduce average male fertility, but asymmetrical competition should be evolutionarily advantageous to some individuals and lead to the evolution of traits that confer a competitive advantage during pollination. Pollen-producing plants can compete for pollinator visits and access to receptive stigmas, even when average seed set in the population is not pollen limited. Variation in male mating success should depend on the abundance and distribution of pollinator visits and fertilizable ovules, the potentially limiting resources. Pr-emptive competition for rare fertilization opportunities or consumptive competition for pollinators can increase variation in male fertility. When pollinators are abundant, synchronous floral presentation is likely to favor attractive plants that export pollen more rapidly than their competitors. In contrast, gradual floral presentation should select for high pollen production and greater efficiency of pollen delivery. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028561428

Several pollination syndromes have been suggested to occur within the genus, including anemophily, epihydrophily (pollen transfer at the water surface), and hypohydrophily (entirely submersed pollination). However, cross-pollination has only recently been unequivocally documented in the family. Terrestrial species appear to be geitonogamous, and produce distinctly tricolpate pollen, with a well-defined, intectate exine. In the various amphibious species, fertilization can occur in two different ways: typical geitonogamy, as in terrestrial species, or by internal geitonogamy, whereby pollen grains precociously germinate within indehiscent anthers and pollen tubes subsequently grow through nodal and pistillate tissues directly to the ovules. Anemophily is also likely in these amphibious species. Pollen grains have weakly differentiated apertures, but well-developed, intectate exines. Molecular data confirm that the obligately submersed C. hermaphroditica is hypohydrophilous. The actual mechanism of pollen transfer has not yet been observed, but several features suggest that pollen grains are effectively dispersed by the water. Pollen of C. hermaphroditica is exineless in perennial forms of the species, and has only a rudimentary exine in annual forms. Callitriche represents the only infrageneric system in which both aerial and underwater pollination co-occur, and provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the evolution of hypohydrophily from aerial systems. © Société botanique de France 1994.",Callitrichaceae; Callitriche; Evolution; Hydrophily; Pollen; Pollination; Ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21844498391

Stingless bees mainly collected pollen and this activity resulted in intimate contact with the stigma. Honey bees mainly collected nectar and came into contact with the stigma less often. Racemes which were enclosed in cages which excluded honey bees but allowed visitation by the smaller stingless bees yielded a nut set equal to that on open-pollinated racemes, showing that these bees are efficient pollinators. Honey bees worked flowers more quickly than stingless bees, visiting more flowers in a given time. Both bee species responded to racemes rich in pollen and nectar by remaining longer at those racemes and visiting more flowers on them. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.",Apis mellifera; Australia; Foraging; Honey bees; Macadamia integrifolia; Nectar; Pollen; Pollination; Pollinators; Proteaceae; Stingless bees; Trigona carbonaria,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028191369

Zygaenidae are the main transferring means for the pollinaria of this orchid. They are attracted to nectarless flowers of A. pyramidalis as a result of the mimetic likeness of orchid inflorescences to the red inflorescences of food plants of these Lepidoptera. The fruit production of the orchid increases when A. pyramidalis is grown with these plants. Zygaena species contribute considerably more to pollination than do Adscita species. At the same time males prevail over females as pollinators. A correlation was found between the square of red spots on the upper wings of females and the ratio of males and females among pollinators. -from Journal summary,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028683757

Plants flowered during the hot season (May-October), and flowers opened for one night only. Variations were observed in the flowers opening time, with the early-opening plants beginning to open two hours before sunset, and the late-opening plants opening close to sunset. Flowers were visited only by day-active insects: the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the carpenter bee (Xylocopa pubescens). The visitors behavior indicated that they were involved in pollination. Early-opening flowers were visited both in the evening and in the morning, whereas late-openers were visited only in the morning. C. peruvianus was found to be self-incompatible, and fruit set did not occur when flowers were hand self-pollinated. Hand cross-pollination resulted in very high fruit set (92%) and heavy fruits with a high seed number. Fruit set, seed number, and fruit weight were lower in open-pollination than in hand cross-pollination. This indicates limited pollination or fertilization in open-pollination and might be related to the briefness of the bee visits, reduced pollen germinability, and stigma receptivity during part of the visit period. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028179183

Examination of flowers collected 7 d after pollination indicated that the cross-pollination treatment generally induced a small (13-19%) but significant increase in the number of pollen grains per stigma. All flowers possessed some pollen grains, but in all cases cross-pollination approximately doubled the percentage of flowers with a pollen tube at the base of the style (42-68% of flowers on cross-pollinated racemes compared with 21-35% of flowers on control racemes). Fruit set after 14 d was always improved by cross-pollination, and this translated into increased final fruit numbers on two out of four occasions. In these two cases, kernel weights were increased by 24 and 31% in the cross-pollinated treatments. This indicates a possible xenic (paternal parent) effect in macadamia. Flower removal resulted in retention of a greater percentage of flowers as fruits, so that only severe reductions in flower number decreased final fruit numbers. Improved efficiency of cross-pollination in macadamia may increase both nut numbers and nut size. © 1994 Academic Press.",Flower number; Fruit drop; Fruit set; Macadamia; Macadamia integrifolia Maiden and Betche; Macadamia tetraphylla L.

Bumblebee claw marks were found on the flower petals of 68% of the flowering ramets of the species. Scanning?electronmicroscopy revealed that pin and thrum pollens of P. sieboldii were deposited in different positions along the proboscis of a B. diversus tersatus queen (n=38400 grains). On the glossa, all the observed pollen was of the pin type, while more than half of the pollen grains observed on the upper part of the proboscis, galea, stipes, and maxillary palpus were of the thrum type. In the field, high fruit and seed sets were recorded for both pin and thrum morphs, indicating the occurrence of sufficient legitimate pollination during the flowering season. In addition to the effectiveness of queen bumblebees as pollinators for P. sieboldii suggested in this study, phenological and morphological matches, i.e., early spring flowering during the queen bee emergence season and the similar lengths of the corolla tube and the bee proboscis, also support the inference that queen bumble bees play an important role in legitimate pollination of P. sieboldii.

In an in vitro test, the germination of pollen from three B. pubescens trees, increased with increasing pollen density (r2= 0·82, 0·81 and 0·82, respectively). Pollen tubes grew at different rates in styles when testing different paternal/maternal combinations. Evidence was obtained to suggest that these differences might be attributed to both maternal and paternal effects. Further, increasing the number of tubes per style tended to increase the length of the longest tube per style, but had no significant effect on the mean length of the tubes. The r values, for the correlations of lengths with numbers of pollen tubes per style, were lower in two natural B pubescens populations than in the data from a controlled pollination experiment, is concluded that selection among male gametes may occur after supplementary pollination in B. pubescens, but in natural situations, pollen deposition is usually too low for pollen Selection to be a common occurrence.

At the same time, a pollination cage was placed over a block of plants in each greenhouse to establish a control (no bees). For 'Plutona', the effect of bumble bees as pollinators was significant (P < 0.05) for fruit weight, fruit width, fruit volume, pericarp volume, seed weight and days from fruit set to harvest. Bee pollination also improved fruit grade, resulting in a greater percentage of extra-large and large fruit, and fruit with four locules. For 'Cubico', pollination by bumble bees significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the number of days from fruit set to harvest and increased the percentage of extra-large and large fruit.

Pollination was prevented by covering plants with floating row covers at the time of first female flowering. Plants were left covered for either 6 or 12 days and then exposed to honey bee visitation. Cultivars used in the 1992 season were Cruiser, Explorer and Primo. Cruiser, Mission and Primo were used in 1993. Twelve colonies of honey bees were placed on the border of the test plots in 1992 and two in 1993. In 1992, Primo plants which had pollination delayed for six days produced heavier fruits and a greater total fruit weight per plant than those not delayed or delayed 12 days. Cruiser and Explorer produced smaller fruits when pollination was delayed 12 days but were unaffected by a 6-day delay. In 1993, Mission delayed for 12 days produced more fruits per plant. No differences in fruit quality (percentage culls, soluble solid content and size) or number were observed in other cultivars when pollination was delayed. In both trials, the median harvest time was about the same as controls when pollination was delayed for six days. These results suggest that the time honey bee colonies need to be in the field for cantaloupe pollination could be reduced. Pollination could be delayed by about one week without negatively affecting productivity or harvest time. This would provide growers additional time in which to apply insecticides should they be needed, and reduce honey bee exposure to insecticides. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.",Apis mellifera; Cantaloupes; Cucumis melo; Honey bees; Melons; Pollination; Productivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028119047

The behaviour and activity patterns of Apis mellifera and of five species of Bombus were analysed in relation to climatic variables and nectar quality on three varieties of unsprayed cultivated raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in eastern Scotland. Stages of floral morphology and reward were similar for the three varieties: young flowers offered both nectar and pollen, but medium and old flowers offered nectar only, in diminishing quantities. A wide range of insects visited raspberry flowers, but bees were dominant, bumblebees being responsible for about 60% of all visits and honeybees making up most of the remaining percentage. All bees had substantial pollen deposited on their bodies during visits, though few specifically collected it. Bombus spp. were found to favour young (receptive) flowers strongly, especially early in the morning when pollen was most abundant: whilst Apis visited unselectively. Bumblebees also foraged over substantially longer periods of the day, and in poorer weather, some being present at most times of observation; and they foraged more quickly in terms of flower visits per minute. Bombus carried more pollen on their bodies than Apis, and also deposited more pollen on raspberry stigmas, with B.lapidarius and B.terrestris being particularly effective and also being the most abundant species. All bumblebees also foraged over a longer range, moving between canes and rows more frequently than did honeybees. Bumblebees are therefore likely to be substantially more important as pollinators of raspberries than are honeybees, especially as raspberries though moderately self?fertile may exhibit metaxenia. Reasons why Bombus may be the preferred pollinator in most sites of raspberry cultivation are discussed, together with implications for present and future growers. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

In addition, figs have a suite of non-pollinating parasitic wasps whose basic ecology is largely undescribed. Figs therefore present the interesting situation of a host that has two closely related taxa associated with it, one of which is mutualistic, the other parasitic. We show that the wasps belonging to the most abundant genus of New World parasites, the Idarnes wasps, develop at the expense of the pollinating wasps and not the viable seeds. However, the Idarnes wasps are not true parasitoids. We interpret these results to mean that the Idarnes wasps are in direct competition with the pollinator wasps for the same pool of flowers in which the larvae of either group can develop. Further, we infer that there is also a pool of flowers that cannot be exploited by either of these taxa. The observation that the pollinators and the parasites oviposit from different sides of the fruit strongly suggests that the basis for preserving some of the flowers to develop as viable seeds is not a direct result of spatial position of the ovaries or style length, as has been previously suggested. This idea is corroborated by detailed observations in many other fig systems. Taken together, these findings suggest an explanation for the stability of the fig-fig-pollinating wasp mutualism, as well as the structure of its parasite community.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028576077

Microscopic observations on early structural changes in the embryo sac indicated that fertilization occurred shortly after pollination (within 5 days). In unpollinated ovaries, the two polar nuclei also fused during this period, leading to a 2n endosperm which started cellularization (wall formation) about 5 days later. Zygote division in pollinated ovaries started approximately 9 days after fertilization while the endosperm at this stage was still in the free?nuclear phase. Gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC?MS) analyses of GAs in pollinated and unpollinated ovaries demonstrated the presence of all members of the 13?hydroxylation GA pathway (GA53, GA44, GA17, GA19, GA20, GA29, GA1, and GA8). In addition, GA4, GA9, and an unknown monohydroxy?GA12 were also detected. Endogenous GAs were quantified by selected ion monitoring (SIM) from pollination up to 13 days later. At the end of this period, pollinated ovaries contained high levels of C20 GAs whereas C19 GAs had declined. Gibberellins A44 and A19 increased slightly shortly after fertilization, then decreased, and lastly accumulated. Gibberellin A20 followed the same step?by?step trend albeit in an opposite manner. Gibberellin A1 showed a transitory increase immediately after fertilization and decreased gradually subsequently. The pattern of GA change in unpollinated ovaries differed mostly as follows: (1) within 13 days after the time of pollination GA53 and GA44 decreased; (2) GA19 increased continuously; (3) GA20 decreased also continuously following the opposite pattern to GA19; and (4) the brief rise in GA1 was higher (2?fold) than in pollinated ovaries, although 13 days after the time of pollination its levels were much lower in unpollinated ones. These results suggest that the sequence pollination/fertilization modulates GA1 levels, first reducing them immediately after fertilization, and subsequently, stimulating moderate amounts shortly thereafter at the beginning of embryogenesis. In unpollinated ovaries the lowest GAI levels coincided with ovary growth arrest, the onset of a rapid and heavy abscission (100%), and an accelerated 2n endosperm cellularization. However, repeated exogenous GA3 applications did not suppress the growth arrest and abscission. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Both species have homogamous, one?day flowers pollinated by bumblebees. The abdomens of the bees touch the stigma on the extended style when they land on the anthers inside the herkogamous flower, and autogamy is effectively prevented. However, the flowers are fairly self?compatible, and geitonogamy may occur rather frequently because two or more flowers on a scape very often bloom at the same time and many ramets are contiguous. The pollen/ovule ratios suggest that these species are facultative outbreeders. The flower of H. sieboldii seems completely suited to bumblebee pollination. In H. sieboldiana the stigma of the flower, whose style strongly protrudes, is not always touched by bumblebees, but frequent visitation of bumblebees results in pollination of almost all the flowers. Both species have similar pollination systems but seem reproductively isolated by blooming times and habitats. Their common pollinators, however, may sometimes cause introgressive hybridization in contiguous populations. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

The evidence supports the prediction of the importance of generalist insect dominated pollination systems, at least for trees and large shrubs, but attention is drawn to a number of cases where specialist interactions have been demonstrated.

Post-pollination mechanisms may, however, buffer the mating system against ecological variation. We combined an examination of mating-system variation with experimental studies of pollen competition in a clonal, self-compatible, tristylous plant, Decodon verticillatus (Lythraceae), to assess proximate mechanisms influencing the mating system in natural populations. Outcrossing rates (t) were estimated for 10 populations in a variety of habitats and exhibiting a wide range of size, density and patchiness. We also investigated whether self-compatibility results in departures from disassortative mating, by estimating morph-specific rates of outcrossing and disassortative mating (d). All population-level estimates of t indicated significant self-fertilization (average t= 0.72) and weak disassortative mating (average d?0.30). There were small but significant differences in outcrossing rates among style morphs, with the mid-styled morph outcrossing at a lower rate (0.62) than the short-styled morph (0.81) and the long-styled morph intermediate (0.71). The expectation of wide variation in t among populations was not supported. Population- level estimates were distributed over a narrow range (0.63-0.86) with few significant differences. A possible mechanism underlying this pattern was revealed by mixed-donor pollinations. Outcross pollen experienced a substantial siring advantage over self pollen.

Spikelets pollinated with pollen of the 4x plant at 1 DPA gave rise to only 4x seedlings, indicating a 2n + 0 parthenogenetic origin. When pollination was achieved 2 DPA, 46% of recovered seedlings were considered to be B, progenies produced through fertilization of the unreduced egg cell of an aposporous embryo sac with a reduced sperm nucleus (2n + n = 40 + 20 = 60). Few seedlings were recovered from 3 DPA, and all were tetraploid, originated through parthenogenesis (2n + 0). When diploid Pensacola Bahiagrass was the pollen donor, all seedlings from 1 DPA were parthenogenetic tetraploids (2n + 0), whereas most from 2 or 3 DPA were B. progenies (2n + n) and had 50 chromosomes (2n = 40 + n = 10) Control seedlings, from pollinations at anthesis time, were all tetraploid (2n + 0), as expected. These results indicate that time of pollination may be manipulated in an apomictic species to increase the production of B, progenies Early pollinations, in some cases, prevent parthenogenetic development of the unreduced egg cell in an aposporous embryo sac, allowing its fertilization. © 1994 The American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028169791

Guanosine?5?0?(2?thiodiphosphate) which does not affect the activity of GTP?binding proteins, had no affect on the sensitivity to ethylene. Western blot analysis of microsomal proteins, revealed that a peptide with a molecular mass of ca 42 kDa cross?reacts with antibodies against a well?conserved amino acid sequence (G??commun peptide) of mammalian G?proteins. Calcium ions, known co?factors of protein kinases, also increased the sensitivity of the flowers to ethylene, while EGTA, a chelator of calcium, decreased it. Phorbol 12?myrisate 13?acetate, a phorbol ester, had no effect on the sensitivity to ethylene. Protein phosphorylation in petal microsomal membranes was doubled in the presence of calcium ions, but was unaffected by phorbol ester. Ten h after pollination, at the peak of ethylene sensitivity, a significant increase of ca 20% was measured in the binding of GTP to the membranes. Protein phosphorylation in flowers increased significantly following pollination, with a single peptide of ca 30 kDa most heavily phosphorylated. These observations may indicate a direct involvement of GTP?binding proteins, and protein phosphorylation, two major components of the cellular signal transduction pathway, in the regulation of pollination induced ethylene sensitivity in phalaenopsis petals.

The wet season was more favourable for the population build-up of E. kamerunicus. As the weevil population in the male inflorescence did not represent the actual numbers present at a given time, an estimation of pollinator force as well as the population size is recommended. Fruitset increased significantly after the introduction of E. kamerunicus, but fluctuated widely between seasons. However, the fluctuation in populations in the male inflorescences, as well as the variation in the number visiting the female inflorescences, did not have any impact on the fruitset. During the dry season when the weevil population was very low, fruitset was high, but during the wet season when the weevil population was very high, the fruitset was lower. Availability of male inflorescences as well as climatic factors such as rainfall, number of rainy days and relative humidity affected the pollinating efficiency of the weevil by reducing the pollen load and its viability. Even though there was a population decline of E. kamerunicus during the dry season there was no reduction in pollinating efficiency and hence there is no need to introduce additional pollinators such as E. subvittatus Faust, which is more efficient during dry seasons. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Foraging honey bee workers were able to discriminate between untainted sugar syrup and syrup containing formulated NSE at concentrations as low as 0.1 ppm azadirachtin, the principal active ingredient of NSE. However there were no significant differences in the numbers of foraging bees collected in neem-treated, solvent-treated, or untreated canola plots.

In an earlier report from Denmark, seed set was said to be low, the species reproducing mainly vegetatively by means of bulbils. Furthermore, investigations in northern England have shown inbreeding depression in gynodioecious 5. granulata populations. The present study, however, demonstrates that 5. granulata is fully self?compatible in Denmark; seed set per flower in hand?selfings was on average 70%, compared to ca. 80% in control plants. Nevertheless, despite high seed set, reproduction by bulbils is probably the most important mode of reproduction. Saxifraga granulata has typically opportunistic flowers which are white, UV?neutral compared to the background reflexion, and offering only a small standing crop of nectar. Optical attraction by the massive flowering over a relatively short period is regarded as a way of overcoming competition from co?occurring, simultaneously flowering species. Saxifraga granulata flowers received visits from at least 27 different insects species. Based on number of recorded flower visits, records on foraging time, and investigations of body surface pollen loads, Rhamphomyia sulcata (Empididae), Cheilosia spp. (Syrphidae), Polyblepharis opaca (Empididae), and Halictus spp. (s.

Pollination of flowers by field-bees and the development of colonies used for pollination in confined environments are closely related. The structural characteristics and the type of covering of the artificial environment, as well as the time when the colony is placed in situ and the length of the residences often influence the activity and survival of these insects. Observations made during the period of strawberry blossom have shown the possibility of colony adaptation to particular semicircular tunnels and plastic film covered greenhouses with side openings. Colonies with small numbers of adults and brood cells adapted better than stronger ones to protected conditions over a 3-week period. Colony growth was inversely proportional to the initial size of the nucleus. Among factors inhibiting flight and colony development was relative humidity above 80%, which causes the protozoon Nosema apis to proliferate, giving rise to nosemiasis. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Confined environment; Honey bees; Insect behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847189564

This study used single-locus electrophoretic surveys of maternal plants and their progeny arrays to test the prediction that this apparent preference for outcross pollen would produce high levels of outcrossing within natural populations. We found instead that plants within three of four populations were almost completely selfed. Outcrossing rates (t) in each of these populations (based on the progeny arrays of a minimum of nine plants) ranged from 0.07 ± 0.03 to only 0.33 ± 0.08 and showed little variation among years, ranging from 0.07 ± 0.03 to 0.10 ± 0.03 for a population sampled in each of two breeding seasons. Furthermore, examination of the progeny arrays from plants in the most intensively studied population revealed virtually no exchange of genes between immediately adjacent plants. Three pairs of alternative homozygotes were near neighbours (separated by less than 2 m) and yet detectable outcrosses comprised only seven of the 108 seeds sampled. In contrast, the fourth population of G. barklyana appeared highly outcrossed (t = 0.85 ±0.2) which is typical of the realized mating system reported for other Australian Proteaceae. These data show that the realized mating system may vary widely among populations and may often be less than optimal. The occurrence of very low outcrossing rates within some populations may reflect the presence of introduced pollinators or other disturbances. © 1994 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Inbreeding; Mate choice; Mating system; Pollination; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028162713

The adult female wasp lives only a few days, and must usually fly to a different tree than her natal tree to locate receptive figs. Trees in receptive phase often occur at very low densities. Reproductive success of both fig and wasp depends on transmission of a very strong signal by the plant. Some evidence exists for the role of olfaction in location of receptive hosts by fig wasps, but very little work has been done on the chemical ecology of host location and host specificity. Here the first experimental evidence is presented for long?distance olfactory attraction of wasps by volatile substances produced by receptive figs, and for short?distance or contact chemostimulation by host volatiles that elicit entry of the wasp into the fig. In studies using Ficus carica L., pentane extracts of receptive?phase figs attract the pollinator Blastophaga psenes L. from distances of at least 5 m in the field. Short?distance chemostimulation was demonstrated in laboratory bioassays. Pentane extracts of receptive figs, when painted onto the ostiole of non?receptive figs, elicit entry of pollinator wasps. Figs emit volatile compounds attractive to pollinating wasps only during the period of receptivity; pentane extracts of non?receptive figs are not attractive. A simple reliable procedure is described to compare the attractivity of different types of extracts (total, internal, and external extracts) and of different fractions, in the first step towards identifying attractant substances. 1994 The Netherlands Entomological Society",bioassays; Blastophaga psenes; chemostimulation; Ficus carica; fig wasps; host orientation; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163512

In natural populations, estimates of the outcrossing rate in hermaphrodites were near to one and ranged from 0.84 ± 0.07 to 1.12 ± 0.11. The effect of plant density on outcrossing rates was studied in two experimental populations of 27 individuals. Contrary to expectation the estimates of the outcrossing rate in hermaphrodites were about 100% for both densities. However, in the sparse population, the fraction of developed seeds of plants used to estimate outcrossing rates was significantly lower than of plants in the dense population (0.41 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.08, respectively). Artificial pollinations of these plants in the greenhouse showed that the fraction of developed seeds was 0.60 ± 0.01 and 0.83 ± 0.05 after self? and cross?pollination, respectively. The combined results suggested that the differential success of self? and cross?pollination might have caused equalization of the outcrossing rates in the experimental populations, despite different plant densities.

They occur in only five families of monocotyledons and 20 families of the dicotyledons. Presenters in 15 families are described here. In the largest plant family (Asteraceae) all taxa have pollen presenters, while in others (e.g. Myrtaceae) they occur in only some species in a few genera. Most presenters are associated with the gynoecium and there is a wide range of forms involving hairs or outgrowths of the stylar tissue. Despite the placement of self pollen close to the stigma most taxa are outcrossing and avoid self fertilization by protandry, with the stigma being covered at anthesis, or by precise placement of pollen so that is does not contact the stigma. Likely selective advantages in the development of pollen presenters include greater accuracy in pollen transfer than in the normal anther to stigma movement and avoidance of interference between male and female organs in the flower. In some groups there is enhanced ability for female choice because effective pollen delivery enables a choice from among many pollen grains, while in others pollen presenters enhance male reproductive success. Study of the pollination biology of plants requires a knowledge of which plants have pollen presenters and a full understanding of the structures in the flower which are associated with the pollen presentation action.

Possibly the red or brown pollen might be a crypto?mimetic adaptation to the dark coloured bill of the pollinating hummingbird (Trochilidae) and secures safe transport to a receptive stigma without being removed by the bird immediately.

Early?blooming plants had a high queen/worker pollinator ratio, while workers predominated on later?blooming plants. No altitudinal difference in distribution of Bombus species occurred. Analysis of 955 corbicular pollen loads from 1158 bumblebees collected yielded 49.5% monolecty for queens and 34.5% for workers with a wider range for queens than for workers. Colors of corollas photographed in visible and ultraviolet light corresponded to the visual spectra of animal pollinators. In the stable plant?pollinator community investigated, pollinating insect activity appears phenologically controlled by floral anthesis and behaviorally related to floral form and function. Bumblebee tongue length, however. Is not a valid determinant for foraging niche separation except in Castilleja with a deep corolla tube accommodating long tongues of hummingbirds and bumblebees. It is concluded that in a biotic community well?coordinated with the physical environment, limited flower constancy of pollen?foraging pollinators appears to contribute a necessary degree of adaptive versatility through sharing of insect and floral resources. Flower constancy is primarily a function of the circumstance in which a pollinator operates and not simply a characteristic of the pollinator itself. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

On HPLC analysis of the aqueous extract of whole unground berries or of the ground pulp, only non-molluscicidal bidesmosidic saponins can be detected. On addition of ground seed to these aqueous extracts the transformation of the naturally occurring saponins to the monodesmosidic molluscicidal saponins can be monitored by HPLC. This confirms earlier conclusions of the confinement of the bidesmosidic saponins to the fruit pulp and hydrolysis to the highly molluscicidal monodesmosidic saponins only after release of an enzyme contained in the seed by crushing the berries. Presence of saponins and enzymes is then determined by two separate genetic systems. Saponins in the pulp are maternally determined only, whereas enzymes in the seed as a result of the pollination also are dependent on the paternal source. Consistent saponin concentrations were obtained in extracts of berries from the same plant pollinated through controlled experiments using male flowers of different origin. It was then concluded that the origin of the pollen was not critical in determining the activity of the enzyme. As a result of an investigation of the optimal extraction time we found, that when finely crushed berries were extracted with water at room temperature almost all of the monodesmosidic saponins were released within 2 h, while coarsely crushed berries took 3 h to release the molluscicidal compounds. Thus, soaking the berries for a longer period of time in the hope of achieving higher concentration of the active saponins was deemed unnecessary. © 1994.",bidesmosidic; esterase; extraction; molluscicidal saponins; mono-demosidic; Phytolacca dodecandra; pollination; triterpene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028052508

The species is common throughout the southeastern United States in marshes, along streams, edges of lakes, and in the understory of moist forests. The clonal species exhibits sexual and vegetative reproduction. Wind and insects both play important roles in pollination. Pollen may be borne by insects directly. Alternatively, the pollen may be borne by wind after its release is triggered from pendulous floral spikes (the Lizard's Tail) by either wind or insect landings (insect?mediated wind pollination). The plants are self?incompatible and seed set results from a combination of pollination modes with wind pollination being the primary mode (rare in the Magnoliidae). Inflorescence and floral structure exhibit adaptive features that facilitate the various modes of pollen transfer, viz., numerous, small scented, protogynous flowers with no perianth, ultraviolet patterns produced by stamen filaments, small pollen grains, curved inflorescences, and exerted stamens, etc. Fruit production and seed germination are documented and plant growth and densities are compared in sunny versus forest sites.

These theoretical explorations assume that proportional allocation to pollen, ovules, and seeds, as well as to secondary features such as showy petals and nectar rewards, can evolve independently within the limits set by total resource availability. In populations of California wild radish, we have shown previously that petal size, a strong determinant of visitation by honey bee pollinators, is positively correlated with both pollen and nectar production, but not with ovule or seed number per flower. These phenotypic associations may reflect selection, environmental correlation, and/or genetic constraint. By exerting selection on the petal size : pollen number ratio over two generations, we eliminated the positive correlation between petal size and pollen production, with both characters showing significant change after a single selection episode. Once these two floral traits became uncoupled, nectar sugar production was significantly correlated only with petal size. Our results suggest that natural selection could readily alter reproductive allocation in these flowers, and that the phenotypic correlations observed in nature may be maintained by selection for effective reproductive phenotypes.

Today, resource matching is restricted to a proximate role, and predator satiation is only one of many theories for the ultimate advantage of masting. Wind pollination, prediction of favourable years for seedling establishment, animal pollination, animal dispersal of fruits, high accessory costs of reproduction and large seed size have all been advanced as possible causes of masting. Of these, wind pollination, predator satiation and environmental prediction are important in a number of species, but the other theories have less support. In future, Important advances seem likely from quantifying synchrony within a population, and examining species with very constant reproduction between years. © 1994.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028165061

Francesco di Sales 2, Gallina, Reggio Calabria, 89061, Italy","The role played by beekeeping within agrarian and natural ecosystems is analyzed, in relation to honey production and, above all, to bees as pollinators. In natural ecosystems, pollinating insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Cole-optera, Diptera and Hymenoptera carry out pollen transport in a great number of plants, belonging to several families (Liliaceae, Cruciferae, Rosaceae, Legumino-sae, Compositae, etc.)- In particular, the spread of Leguminosae, which is helped by wild Apoidea and by Apis mellifera L., creates a symbiosis between these plants and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, with a consequent increase in soil fertility. Agrarian ecosystems are extremely unfavourable to wild pollinators, due to crop specialization and the consequent biotic simplification. Pollination is ensured, both in self-sterile and self-fertile plants, by honey-bees, which may be easily bred and subsequently transported. This leads to an appreciable increase in production, which is roughly estimated in Italy to be of about 2,000 billion lire. By contrast, honey and all the other beekeeping products (wax, pollen, royal jelly, propolis), though representing the economic basis of apiarian farms, give a total profit of about 30 billion lire. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Biotic pollination; Entomogamous cultivated species; Honeybee; Melliferous flora,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042275685

In each orchard, bees were offered the same choice of paper straws of four different lengths (12, 15, 18, and 21 cm) inserted in milk?carton nesting materials. Releasing methods used differed between orchards: bees of orchard A were released within their natal straws; bees of orchard B were released by inserting individual cocoons in new straws; bees of orchard C were mass?released in emergence boxes. Nesting bees at each orchard were counted, and the results showed that significantly more females dispersed in orchard C (79.10%), than in orchard B (51.04%) or orchard A (28.34%). Females preferred to nest in longer straws (15 to 21 cm) than in 12 cm straws in the three orchards. In general, the number of cells built per nest increased, and sex ratio (males/females) of progeny decreased with straw length. Previously occupied straws were preferred to previously unoccupied straws in both orchards A and B. Comparison of these results with results obtained in other studies indicates that O. cornuta females select new holes when attractive nesting materials are offered, and previously occupied holes when less attractive nesting materials are available. Osmia cornuta Latr. (Hym., Megachilidae) als möglicher Bestäuber in Mandelbaumkulturen. Freisetzungsmethoden and Nestlänge In drei Mandelbaumkulturen in der Nähe von Reus (Nordostspanien) wurden Osmia cornuta?Populationen freigesetzt. In jeder Plantage wurden den Bienen Papierstrohhalme in 4 verschiedenen Längen (12, 15, 18 und 21 cm Länge) zum Nestbau angeboten. Die Freisetzungsmethoden unterschieden sich in den 3 Plantagen: in Plantage A wurden die Bienen in ihren Brutzellen ausgesetzt; in Plantage B wurden die Kokons in neue Strohhalme überführt und in diesen ausgesetzt; in Plantage C erfolgte die Freisetzung in Schlüpfboxen. In jeder Versuchsfläche wurden die nestbauenden Bienen gezählt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, daß sich in C signifikant mehr Weibchen ausgebreitet hatten (79,10%) als in B (51,04% und in A (28,34%). Die Weibchen bevorzugten zum Nestbau längere Strohhalme (15 bis 21 cm). Die Zahl der Zellen pro Nest stieg, und das Geschlechterverhältnis (Männchen/Weibchen) der Brut nahm mit zunehmender Länge der Strohhalme ab. In Fläche A und B wurden zuvor bereits genutzte Strohhalme neuen gegenüber bevorzugt angenommen. Der Vergleich dieser Ergebnisse mit denen anderer Versuche ergab, daß die Weibchen von O. cornuta neues Material für den Nestbau bevorzugen, wenn attraktives Material angeboten wird. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028050827

A. mellifera visited significantly more flowers (mean, 164193) than A. cerana (mean, 129172) during single foraging trips at each site. There was no significant difference between the two species for number of flowers visited per minute. More bees of both species and at all sites foraged for pollen as top workers in the morning than later in the day, when side working (for nectar) was more prevalent. A. mellifera and A. cerana did not differ in the proportions of top or side worker bees at the three observation times, 09.00, 12.00 and 15.00 h. On average, more bees were seen foraging on sunny than on shady sides of trees but these differences were not significant at all sites. Both species at each location preferred to forage on trees nearer to their hives. Bees tended to move to trees located in different rows rather than in same rows, presumably because rows were oriented up and down slopes. Both species showed the same floral fidelity during pollination: bees in all orchards carried pollen loads that were more than 95% apple pollen. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.",Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Apple; Foraging; Honey bees; India; Malus pumila,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028119046

An introductory chapter provides an evolutionary context and introduces tropical flowers. Six chapters then deal with general structural and biological features of flowers and illustrate facets of their diversity: floral organization (structural units and floral symmetry, perianth, androecium, gynoecium, and floral phyllotaxis); floral construction/architecture; adaptation to different pollinators; differentiations associated with pollinator attraction (for example - nectaries, resin glands/flowers, optical displays, and tactile guides); differentiations associated with breeding systems (for example - sex expression, dichogamy, herkogamy, heterostyly, and agamospermy); and the process of anthesis. Chapter eight then outlines floral diversity and evolution of selected tropical systematic groups: Magnoliales (Magnoliidae); Laurales (Magnoliidae); Aristolochiales (Magnoliidae); Lecythidales (Dilleniidae); Violales (Dilleniidae); Fabales (Rosidae); Gentianales (Asteridae); Scrophulariales (Asteridae); Zingiberales (Zingiberidae); and Orchidales (Liliidae). Next, the salient aspects of flower evolution are reviewed. To conclude, the author underlines the need for research synthesis at all levels. -S.R.Harris",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041146496

The betalain products, alkaloids called betacyanins and betaxanthins, are found only in one group of Angiosperms, the Caryophyllales, while anthocyanins are widely distributed. However, their distribution within the plant and both their vegetative and reproductive functions are essentially identical. Whereas the functions in pollination and seed dispersal of both pigments are well known, their vegetative functions are ill-defined. The structural and many of the regulatory genes of the anthocyanin pathway are now well known, but our knowledge of the betalain pathway is severely restricted. Future needs in physiological and molecular genetic studies of the evolutionary mechanism of the mutual exclusion of these two pathways, as well as the vegetative functions of the two groups, are emphasized in this review. © 1994.",Anthocyanin; Betacyanin; Betalain; Betaxanthin; Enzymes; Molecular genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027974462

HPLC?chromatograms of bean extracts were recorded at two wavelengths (254 and 275 nm) and the ratio between the absorbances of these chromatograms was used in combination with retention times to identify phenolics in the relatively complex extracts. Formation of vanillin, the major flavour compound, started around 16 weeks after pollination and reached maximum values around 26 weeks after pollination. Other phenolic vanilla flavour components detected were 4?hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4?hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillyl alcohol and vanillic acid.

In P. farinosa we discovered positive relationships between seed number per capsule and capsule number per inflorescence. As capsules are formed in most flowers, scapes with few flowers set the fewest seeds per capsule. This suggests that conspicuousness to pollinators and/or plant resource play an important role in reproductive success in this species. Seed size and seedling performance were also positively associated. For P. farinosa, which has multi?seeded fruits, we discovered an inverse association between seed size and seed number for capsules containing more than 65 seeds. We suggest that stabilizing selection may occur for flower number per inflorescence in this species, as inflorescences with 811 capsules tend to set many seeds which may be inefficiently small. This tends to confirm our hypothesis. However, for A. maritima there is a positive association between seed size and seed number per inflorescence. For such plants with single?seeded fruits there should be directional selection for large flower number pet?inflorescence, a trend which may have led to the evolution of the capitulum.

The female cones broke dormancy in mid?April. Anthesis took place at the end of April. No micropylar?pollination droplet was observed. After pollination the female cones developed quickly. The most important loss of cones occurred during the pollination period. The number of archegonia varied from one to three but two was most common. Fertilization took place at the end of June.

Particular attention was paid to the years 1989, 1990 and 1991, since there were marked climatic abnormalities during this period, especially in the form of an increase in the mean temperature for February and March compared with the means for 1803-1988. The onset dates of the principal pollination period (PPP) and the thermal sums (T sums) for 1989-91, both from 1st January and over the 30 days prior to the onset of pollination, were compared with the corresponding data for 1984-1988, published in a previous study. The amount of pollen collected for each taxon in each year was calculated. In 1989-91, the dates for the onset of pollination were almost always earlier than in the years when temperatures lay within the mean range, although they were not always accompanied by constant T sum values close to those of 1984-88. In some cases, the T sums were higher (Alnus, Betula, Cupressaceae, Oleaceae, Populus). These taxa would seem to be able to begin flowering when a particular threshold is reached. The extent to which this critical value is exceeded, however, does not appear to be in proportion to the time taken to reach the moment when pollen is first released. By contrast, for Platanus and Juglans, a close correspondence between the T sums and PPP onset was noted. Late flowering taxa (Castanea, Artemisia and Ambrosia) were more constant with respect to their pollen distribution periods and T sums. © 1995 Scandinavian University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028191478

It is shown that LAT52 encodes a heat?stable, glycosylated protein that traverses the secretory pathway when expressed in a baculovirus expression system. The LAT52 protein shows some similarity with Kunitz trypsin inhibitors and with pollen proteins from maize, rice and olive, but the biological function of these pollen proteins is unknown. To test whether the LAT52 protein plays an important role during pollen development, tomato plants were transformed with an antisense LAT52 gene driven by the LAT52 promoter. Because the LAT52 gene is expressed gametophytically, only 50% of the pollen of the primary transformants would be expected to express the antisense construct. Self?progeny of 19 of the primary transformants showed the predicted 3:1 segregation for a single locus insertion of the linked kanamycin?resistance gene. However, the self?progeny of the other 32 primary transformants showed a 1:1 segregation pattern and could not transmit the linked kanamycin?resistance gene through the male. A subset of these 1:1 segre. gation class plants was examined in detail. The pollen showed lower levels of LAT52 mRNA and LAT52 protein when compared with wild?type. In vitro, approximately 50% of the pollen grains appear to hydrate abnormally; this anomaly is not present when the same pollen grains are Incubated in a medium with higher water potential. In vivo pollination experiments showed that the growth of around 50% of the pollen tubes is arrested in the style. The 3:1 segregation class plants showed no significant differences from untransformed control plants. Taken together, the results show a direct correlation between the reduced expression of LAT52 protein and abnormal pollen function, and suggest that the LAT52 protein plays a role in pollen hydration and/or pollen germination.

Twenty-two traits derived from leaf, stem, and flowering measurements were analyzed in 90 F2 individuals that were also classified for genotype by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Seventy-two RFLP loci, which covered the mapped genome at an average of 10 map-unit intervals on all nine linkage groups, were tested individually for associations to phenotypic measurements by single factor ANOVA, and markers with significant associations (P&lt;0.05) were used to develop multilocus models. These data were utilized to describe the location, parental contribution of alleles, magnitude of effect, and the gene action of trait loci. Single marker loci that were significantly associated (P&lt;0.05) with trait measurements accounted for 6.742.7% of the phenotypic variation. Multilocus models described as much as 60.1% of the phenotypic variation for a given trait. In some cases, different related traits had common marker-locus associations with similar gene action and genotypic class ranking. The numbers, action, and linkages, of genes controlling traits estimated with marker loci in this population corresponded to estimates based on classical genetic methods from other studies using similar, or similarly-wide, crosses. There was no evidence that genome duplication accounted for a significant portion of multiple genes controlling trait loci over the entire genome, but possible duplications of trait loci were identified for two regions with linked, duplicated marker loci. © 1994, Springer-Verlag.

Limnanthes show genetic variation patterns to be predictable from the geographical range of various metapopulation units and breeding systems; the wide-ranging species (L. alba, L. douglasii) are more variable and heterozygous than the inbreeding and narrowly distributed species (L. floccosa, L. bakeri). Life history comparisons showed a critical role of seed bank and early flowering in the lower amplitude of population numbers, correlated with greater persistence of even small populations in L. floccosa than its closest outbreeding relative L. alba. Populations of several Orcuttia species provided evidence for the critical role of early seeding establishment in their persistence. Conservation programs have focused on the habitat protection by setting up several nature reserves and on monitoring the vernal pool communities. Populations of the introduced rose clover Trifolium hirtum have been studied during their colonizing phase of pastures and along roadsides. Pollinators account for gene flow among such colonies and genetic variation is significantly ubiquitous even under higher rates of selfing. Input high levels of variability helped in colony success. Gynodioecy seems to have evolved and increased in relative frequency in the areas of new range expansion. The serpentine sunflower Helianthus exilis has become a sort of cause celebre due to its biosystematic status change.

In addition, samples of infructescences emitted none or lower amounts of the compounds above. The difference in scent composition was large enough to distinguish three studied populations from each other, and from the blanks, in a principal component analysis.

Several studies have addressed the response of C3 cereals to CO2, but the interactive effect of nutrient supply and CO2 on apical development and spikelet set and survival has not been investigated thoroughly. Hence, an experiment was conducted in the greenhouse to evaluate the effect of high (700 ?mol CO2mol?1 air) and low (400 ?mol mol?1) levels of atmospheric CO2 on apical development, spikelet set and abortion, and pre? and post?anthesis growth in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown under high N (0.3 g N pot?1 before sowing ?10.11 g N pot?1 week?1) and low N (0.3 g N pot?1) regimes. The plants were grown in 5 L pots. Development of spike was hastened due to CO2 enrichment, and the C+ plants pollinated few days earlier than the C plants. Carbon dioxide enrichment had no effect on date of ripening. Development of spike slowed following application of extra N, and plants pollinated 10 days later and matured 2 weeks later when compared with plants under low N. Carbon dioxide enrichment did not affect the number of spikelets at anthesis. Excess N decreased spikelet abortion and the increased maximum number of spikelets under both [CO2]. Barley plants did not tiller when grown in low [CO2] and low N. Increased endogenous IAA concentration in those plants, recorded three days before tillers appeared in other treatments, may have contributed to this. Carbon dioxide enrichment increased the C concentration of plants, but decreased the N concentration under high N regime. Both the C and N concentration of plants were increased under high N regime. Carbon dioxide enrichment increased the total dry matter of mature plants by 9 % under high N regime and by 21 % under low N regime. Under high [CO2] increased kernel number on tiller spikes, and increased kernel weight both on main stem and on tiller spikes resulted in a 23 % increase in kernel yield under low N regime and 76 % increase in kernel yield under high N regime. The rate of N application influenced growth and yield components to a greater extent than CO2 enrichment. At maturity, plant dry matter, kernel weight, the number of kernels per spike, and the number of spikes per plant were higher under high N regime than under low N regime. Long days (16 h), low light intensity (280 ?mol m?2s?1), and at constant temperature of 20 °C high [CO2] increased kernel weight and the number of kernels on tiller spikes under high and low N application rate, but did not increase the number of kernels on main stem spike, or the number of tillers or tiller spikes per plant.

Major problems underlying this lack of use are the very high standards of quarantine and quality demanded of export produce, the relatively high cost of Bt and its shortcomings in efficacy and persistence. A substantial increase in use appears unlikely unless there is a significant reduction in synthetic pesticide use on export crops. In contrast, rapid progress on research into plant transformation in New Zealand has led to proposals to insert Bt genes into an increasing range of crops. Although transgenic plants show great potential for pest control, there is concern that continual expression of Bt proteins in plant tissue will increase the intensity of selection for pest resistance. A particular concern is the possibility that Bt-resistant cosmopolitan pests may spread between different transgenic crops. A plan to combat this problem through the integrated use of different Bt genes in different crops is suggested. © 1994.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949148510

Isoelectric focusing under denaturing conditions followed by immunoblotting revealed the presence of five GS subunits from intact endosperm changed strikingly with development. Developmental changes in the isozyme patterns were less dramatic in the EDSC. Culturing the EDSC on alternative nitrogen sources changed the relative proportions of isozymes and affected growth and zein accumulation. It was concluded that while the EDSC do resemble intact endosperm in that they express the same GS subunits, the differences in the relative proportions of those subunits and the corresponding isozymes and differences in developmental changes make extrapolations of results obtained from studies of nitrogen metabolism using the endosperm suspension cultures to the intact endosperm inappropriate. © 1994, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

The effect of temperature on the rate of nectar secretion was significant in all clones. The optimum temperature for secretion in three clones varied from 10°C for a clone of Icelandic origin, to 18°C in a clone selected from a Danish variety. Similarly, the average nectar yield varied significantly among clones of different geographical origin. One clone secreted two to four times more than others at 10°C. The optimum day temperature for nectar secretion was higher when the plants were exposed to low night temperature, presumably a result of decreased night respiration. Nectar accumulated at the floret base until senescence. Evidence for reabsorption of nectar was obtained in four clones. Sucrose, fructose and glucose were identified as the major sugars in the nectar. High night temperatures led to decreased sucrose percentage in favour of glucose and fructose. The frequency of new florets opening per day was not influenced by temperatures between 10 and 22°C in one clone, whereas low temperatures significantly decreased the number of new florets in another. Few or no modified stomata were observed in the epidermis of the nectary. The high variation with respect to nectar secretion at low temperatures, along with the high heritability of this quality, suggests that breeding for high nectar production at low temperature is plausible.

We tested these two predictions in plants since flowers are subjected to strong directional selection and are involved in signalling to pollinators, whereas leaves are supposed not to be directly involved in signalling. The overall level of fluctuating asymmetry in a number of plant species with bilaterally or radially symmetric flowers was not generally higher in floral traits than in leaves. The level of fluctuating asymmetry in plants was sometimes significantly consistent within individuals. The absolute degree of individual fluctuating asymmetry in floral traits was generally negatively related to the size of the trait, while there was a positive relationship for leaves. The degree of individual fluctuating asymmetry in floral traits was marginally negatively related to the degree of individual fluctuating asymmetry in leaf traits. These patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in plants suggest that (i) the degree of asymmetry in flowers signals different aspects of quality than does the degree of asymmetry in leaves, and that (ii) fluctuating asymmetry in flowers often reflects the phenotypic quality of individual plants.

The persistence of such a mating heteromorphism is in direct contrast to the theoretical expectation that mixed-mating strategies are evolutionarily unstable. Studies designed to detect fitness advantages of chasmogamous reproduction find only slight differences in the fitness of seed from the two reproductive modes. Inbreeding in chasmogamous flowers could cause these results. This hypothesis was tested by estimating the parameters of the correlated matings model for each of three generations in a natural population of I. pallida using multilocus electrophoretic data from 8934 chasmogamous seed sampled from 1080 individuals. Effective selfing in chasmogamous flowers averaged more than 0.50, changing from 0.66 to 0.54 to 0.48 over three generations. Geitonogamous selfing comprised approximately 80 per cent of this inbreeding in each generation: the remainder was mating among relatives. The correlation of selfing and the correlation of outcrossed paternity within and among the chasmogamous flowers of individuals were moderate in each generation, ranged within + 0.11 to + 0.21 and changed little over three generations. Individuals that were further from their nearest neighbour or were shorter produced a greater proportion of inbred chasmogamous seed. Those that produced more chasmogamous flowers had higher rates of geitonogamous selfing. Taken together these results are strong evidence that substantial inbreeding occurred in chasmogamous flowers through both geitonogamous selfing and biparental inbreeding, that this inbreeding caused the genetic correlation of chasmogamous sibs to be more similar to the genetic correlation among completely selfed sibs than to the genetic correlation among completely outcrossed sibs, that effective selfing within chasmogamous flowers can change over generations and be influenced by plant architecture and pollinator behaviour, and that chasmogamous flowers of I. pallida have a stable, partially selfing mating strategy. © 1994 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Cleistogamy; Correlated matings; Genetic covariance; Impatiens; Inbreeding; Sibs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028160494

The polymorphic region of the chloroplast genome is located near duplicated psbA genes. Fourteen length variants were found in the survey, and these variants distinguished the two species qualitatively. Variant diversities were high in both species (h(es) = 0.43 in jack pine; h(es) = 0.44 in lodgepole pine). Population subdivision was weak within and among lodgepole pine subspecies and in jack pine (i.e., ? values were less than 0.05). This weak subdivision is compatible with theoretical predictions for paternally inherited markers in wind-pollinated outcrossers, as well as for polymorphisms with high length mutation rates.

In one of these strains, a deletion generated a null allele of the SRK structural gene. This deleted haplotype exhibited typical interactions when combined with other normal haplotypes in heterozygotes indicating that other functions of the haplotype were retained.

In 1990 and 1991 two populations were reared in the laboratory. Bees were incubated at 2530 °C during the summer and overwintered in refrigerators at 37 °C for 112 and 167 days respectively. In spring bees were released in the field and provided with nesting materials with holes of different diameters. Bees that had been exposed to longer over?wintering periods emerged sooner and expressed lower overwintering mortality than bees exposed to shorter over?wintering periods. Females preferred to nest in holes of 7 mm i.d. The nesting season lasted from 2 to 2,5 months. O. tricornis is a highly polylectic species and collected pollen mainly from flowers producing little or no nectar (Quercus, Cistus, Papaver, Ranunculus, etc.).

Seedlings that had been preconditioned to drought survived 14 days longer than seedlings that had been well watered before being subjected to drought. Seed sources varied in their ability to survive drought and this variation was accentuated by drought preconditioning. Seedlings from a South Dakota source and a Nebraska source generally survived the longest under drought. Seedlings from a Montana source and a New Mexico source succumbed the fastest after water was withheld. Significant family within source variation in drought survival was observed for some sources. In general, drought survival was poorly correlated to climate indices of the seed sources. Allocation of biomass to roots, stems, and needles varied significantly among the seed sources with the most drought-sensitive sources (Montana and New Mexico) showing the most divergent allocation patterns. The relation between drought survival and shoot/root ratio suggested that there is an optimum pattern of allocation for drought survival. A comparison of the most and least drought-tolerant sources indicated that needle gas exchange (net photosynthesis and needle conductance to water vapor) and predawn needle water potential were similar among the sources regardless of their relative ability to survive drought. Needle morphology traits often associated with variation in drought tolerance, such as stomatal density and specific leaf area, did not differ among the seed sources. However, seedlings from the drought-tolerant sources had shorter needles, less surface area per needle, and fewer stomata per needle than seedlings from the drought-sensitive sources. The results suggest that drought tolerance of ponderosa pine may be improved through seed source selection and, within certain sources, family selection. Allocation patterns and needle morphology appear to play a larger role than needle gas exchange patterns in determining drought tolerance in this species. © 1994 Heron Publishing.",Biomass partitioning; Genetic diversity; Genotypic selection; Needle morphology; Preconditioning; Shoot/root ratio; Stomatal density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001195694

A field experiment was conducted under irrigation to evaluate effects of changes in nitrogen and carbon supplies on development of yield components in plants having similar ear size at anthesis. Attention was given to silk extrusion of distal ovaries and to endosperm growth and development. Two levels of nitrogen of fertilizer at planting (0 and 167 kg N ha-1; n and N) and two plant densities (36 600 and 73 200 plants ha-1; d and D), imposed at initiation of silking, were used to manipulate nitrogen and carbon supplies. Although nitrogen stress reduced whole-plant nitrogen concentration ([N]) and area, phenology and aboveground dry mass per plant at silking were not affected. Spikelet number and initial mass of developing kernels were also similar among treatments. Nitrogen stress led to fewer kernels due mainly to reduced emergence of distal silks through less cell division; subsequent abortion was more density dependent. Unfertilized and high-density treatments resulted in less kernel mass per ear and smaller kernel [N]. Only density affected individual-kernel mass. In treatments where distal kernel mass varied, maximum endosperm length, 25 days after silking (DAS), was correlated with kernel volume and individual-kernel dry mass. The greater endosperm cell number in high-nitrogen treatments was accompanied by a smaller cell size. In most cases, maximum cell number in endosperm of proximal kernels was apparently not achieved by 25 DAS. Constant carbon/nitrogen ratio in apparent fluxes of substrates to the ear during the exponential phase of kernel growth was observed with all treatments. Crop parameters were strongly affected by density, and compensatory growth was evident in the grain yield of the low-density treatments. Harvest indices were similar. © 1994.",Density; Endosperm development; Maize; Nitrogen; Silk emergence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028042267

Self?incompatibility prevailed both in original and in inbred and crossbred plants, as judged from seed?setting data in situ under greenhouse conditions. Of the intercrosses (no complete diallels) among I1 and F1 siblings, 13.8% and 0%, respectively, were judged to be incompatible. Parental plants pollinated by backcross families (P × BC, 308 combinations tried) had 4.2 % cases of cross?incompatibility. Calculations were applied to these data, aiming at minimum degrees of cross?incompatibility to be expected in different intercrosses at different numbers of S?loci, considering (1) pure disomic inheritance, (2) an autotetraploid with chromosome or (3) random chromatid assortment, (4) an amphidiploid with two S?gene systems brought together, acting independently of one another, or (5) interdependently, with functional incompatibility specificities being formed through interaction not only within but also between the two systems. It was concluded that the data indicate an S?gene system with disomic inheritance of one team of at least 4 loci with complementary cooperation. To explain the presence of such an S?gene system in a tetraploid, it is speculated that self?incompatibility genes on a polysomic level are accompanied by too high degrees of cross?incompatibility to be retained in the long run and have gradually to adopt disomic formation of incompatibility specificities.

ProRIP is synthesized coordinately with the major storage proteins and requires a functional allele of the transcriptional activator, Opaque-2 (O2)3 for maximal accumulation. RIP1 gene expression was characterized by developmental RNA gel blot analysis. RIP1 RNA was first detected at 10 days after pollination (DAP), and increased in abundance to reach maximal levels at mid-maturation of the kernel. In four W64A maize lines with independently-derived opaque-2 (o2) alleles, RIP1 RNA still accumulated in a developmentally specific pattern, but showed qualitative and quantitative changes from normal. RNA gel blots reprobed with an O2-specific probe provided evidence for coordinate accumulation of RIP1 and O2 RNAs throughout normal kernel development. The pleiotropic endosperm mutations brittle-1 (bt1), brittle-2 (bt2), shrunken-2 (sh2), sugary-2 (su2), Mucronate (Mc), Defective endosperm-B30 (De*-B30), and floury-2 (fl2), affected RIP1 and O2 RNA accumulation to varying degrees. None of these mutations, however, resulted in RIP1 RNA reductions comparable to that seen in W64Ao2. When coupled with o2, bt1 and bt2 mutations showed synergistic interactions in their effects of reducing RIP1 RNA levels. Thus, RIP1 gene expression and relative RNA levels are controlled by multiple factors including O2, and o2-independent component(s), genetic background, and the presence of other pleiotropic mutations. © 1994.",Cereal; Endosperm; Maize; Ribosome-inactivating protein; Zea mays; Zein,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011561206

All characters with the exception of pollen number showed significant amounts of additive genetic variance indicating a potential to respond to selection.

However, most characters still displayed heritable variation after the flower size effect was removed by analysis of covariance. Families showed considerable variation in the ability to self in glasshouse conditions. Only a weaK relationship between autofertility and herKogamy was detected, suggesting that an unidentified mechanism was responsible for differences in selfing ability.

It is postulated that the heritable variation observed is maintained in this population through disruptive selection on autofertility in response to seasonal variation in the onset of spring drought and pollinator availability. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Additive genetic variances; Autofertility; Floral traits; Male-female trade-offs; Mimulus guttatus; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027949631

The flowers of D. ferruginea contain no food reward and, instead, appear to secure pollinator visits by imitating flowers which are nectar sources for the butterfly. A red?flowered form of D. ferruginea appears to mimic the red nectar?producing flowers of Tritoniopsis triticea (Iridaceae) in the south?western Cape, while an orange?flowered form of D. ferruginea appears to mimic the orange nectar?producing flowers of Kniphofia uvaria (Asphodelaceae) in the Langeberg Mountains. Reflectance spectra of the orchid's flowers closely match those of its putative models. Analysis of foraging movements of the butterfly in a mixed stand of D. ferruginea and T. triticea indicated that it does not discriminate between the nectarless orchid and the nectar?producing model. Populations of D. ferruginea which are sympatric with T. triticea have relatively high levels of pollination and fruit production, compared with populations where the orchid grows alone. Although other studies have reported relatively low fecundity in deceptive orchids, pollination and fruiting success in D. ferruginea compares favourably with a nectar?producing congener, Disa uniflora, which is also pollinated solely by M. tulbaghia.

We have, therefore, studied the growth response of a tree species (Prunus avium L. Stella (wild cherry)) to elevated CO2 and characterized the associated changes in photosynthetic machinery of the leaf tissue. Self-pollinated seedlings and mature cuttings (clones) from the same parent plant off. avium were grown for two consecutive growing seasons (about 60 days each) in ambient CO2 (350 ?mol mol-1 CO 2) or elevated CO2 (700 ?mol mol-1 CO 2) with a high or low nutrient supply. The degree of acclimation of leaf biochemistry and growth response to elevated CO2 was dependent on the plant material (seedling or mature cutting) and nutrient supply. There was little or no growth response to elevated CO2 in seedlings or cuttings in the low nutrient supply treatments, whereas, in both seasons, there was a strongly positive growth response to elevated CO2 in seedlings and cuttings in the high nutrient supply regimes, resulting in increases in the root/shoot ratio and in carbon allocation to the roots. In contrast, the protein content and activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) were down regulated in elevated CO2. The loss of Rubisco on an area basis in plants in the elevated CO2 treatments was compensated for at the canopy level by increased leaf area. The loss of Rubisco protein was accompanied by decreases in the contents of chlorophyll and the thylakoid membrane proteins D1, D2 and cytochrome f, which are involved in light harvesting and photo-electron transport. We conclude that, in the medium- to long-term, the initial stimulation of biomass production by elevated CO2 may be increasingly offset by a lower photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area in perennial plants. © 1994 Heron Publishing.",Mineral nutrition; Rubisco; Thylakoid membrane,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001080261

Propagation is easily achieved by seed, coppice, or cuttings. Coppicing can produce faster and cheaper regeneration than seedlings, but taper becomes more pronounced with age of the felling stool. Intercropping is often practised: this reduces weed competition and benefits soil fertility and microbial activity. Mixed stands provide protection from pests and diseases. Favored stocking rates are 3000-3600 stems ha-1 although 1800-2500 stems ha-1 produce better volume growth. Intensively managed short rotations and a high nutrient requirement of the species necessitates application of fertilizer to maintain site productivity. Short rotations of 15-20 yr are acceptable, although rotation ages are typically 20-25 yr. Growth variation between regions is attributed to temperature and length of growing season, which are related to latitude. Mean annual increments at age 20 for good production areas are 12.5-17.5 m3ha-1, while high yield areas can be 20 m3 ha-1. Distribution and provenance studies demonstrate differences, with best productivity occurring in the Nanling-Fujian area. Tree breeding research has shown significant productivity gains from open pollination of plus trees and controlled crosses (eg up to 30% volume). High family heritability indicates that early mass selection can be an efficient method for increasing productivity. Genetic gains from clonal orchards have been estimated as 27% for volume. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028553720

Because fig crop development on any one tree is usually synchronised, the small and short?lived female wasps have to migrate and find other trees bearing figs which are at suitable stage of development for oviposition. However, the likelihood of successful location and subsequent arrival at a new host tree is dependent on distance and the effect of environmental factors such as wind and temperature. This study examines the relationship between ambient temperatures and the timing of fig wasps emergence from their natal figs and the commencement of their dispersal flight. The behaviour of the wasps arriving at figs which were ready to be pollinated was also examined. The female wasps did not appear to distinguish between the figs and other parts of the tree when in flight. However, after landing on the tree their search for figs was more directed as they visited more figs than leaves. Short?range recognition of figs appears to be by contact chemo?reception, but the wasps showed a preference for entering figs which did not already contain a female wasp. 1994 The Netherlands Entomological Society",Agaonidae; dispersal; Ficus; host choice; migration; Moraceae; take off; temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028183713

These sorghums were therefore also investigated under natural and artificial disease pressures in Zimbabwe where unadapted development and inappropriate long daylength prevented flowering in 18 accessions. Of the remaining 16 Ethiopian and 10 Rwandan accessions which flowered, only one from each country remained free of ergot. The susceptibility expressed was ascribed to observed asynchrony of stigma exsertion with anthesis. In the Rwandan accession that persistently remained free of ergot in Zimbabwe, histology of ovules showed pollination before floret gaping, so that a general principle of disease escape due to efficient pollination is proposed for the Ethiopian and Rwandan sorghums in their native climates. The findings emphasize that cleistogamy is a desirable character for avoiding ergot infection in self?fertile sorghums and suggest that the Ethiopian and Rwandan sorghums may not generally be useful for breeding ergot?resistant male?sterile female lines. However, a few accessions deserve more detailed study as a potential genetic resource, before a firm conclusion that all apparent resistance is disease escape owing to efficient pollination.

Hawkmoth flowers are typically white to the human eye. As the retinas of hawkmoths contain ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors, flower patterns reflecting ultraviolet wavelengths might be significant to sphingid feeding behavior. The flowers of ten hawkmoth-pollinated species were examined with an ultraviolet sensitive video system in Monteverde, Costa Rica. All lacked ultraviolet reflectance. A common hawkmoth species, Manduca sexta, was used in free choice experiments to determine which wavelengths elicited proboscis extension, probing and drinking of sugar water. When offered a choice between artificial flowers or backlighted filters, Manduca strongly preferred to feed at those reflecting or transmitting only wavelengths >400 nm, avoiding those that also included ultraviolet wavelengths. Feeding behavior was thus best elicited by stimuli that mimicked the reflectance of typical hawkmoth flowers. Feeding behavior must be primarily activated by either the green- or violet-sensitive mechanisms (or both) of the hawkmoth visual system, while concurrent activation of the ultraviolet-sensitive mechanism interferes with it. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028553697

Experiments were done in a growth chamber at 18°C. Increases in daylength shortened the period of apical development. The oat cultivars were especially responsive to increase in daylength from 15 h to 18 h. The increase in daylength resulted in a 45 % reduction in number of fertile florets and a slight increase in the proportion of incompletely development and stunted florets. Fertility of florets was most reduced on the lower primary and secondary branches of the panicle. Total number of leaves and phyllochron decreased as daylength increased. Moreover, the longer the day, the lower the number of green leaves per main stem until developmental stage 11. However, at pollination, oats exposed to 15?h days had the lowest number of green leaves. Results of study indicated that delayed sowing, when associated with longer days at pre?anthesis, hastened apical development and decreased yield potential in oats. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

But aside from providing rewards, flowers can be risky places to visit, for example if a predator ambushes during the feeding/pollination process. Here, we show that pollination may also involve the transmission of pathogens for the pollinators. Experimental evidence is given that a trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted within populations of its hosts, the bumblebees Bombus spp., through the shared use of flowers. Important floral characteristics such as nectar availability or inflorescence architecture may also affect transmission rate. Therefore, in addition to energetic considerations, pollinator strategies could also be governed by the risk of contracting pathogens.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028554067

The genotypes included 37 broccolis (var. italica), five cauliflowers (var. botrytis) and three cabbages (var. capitata) which represented a wide range of commercially-available germplasm, and included open-pollinated cultivars, commercial hybrids, and inbred parents of hybrid cultivars. Fifty-six polymorphic RFLP bands and 181 polymorphic RAPD bands were generated using 15 random cDNA probes and 62 10-mer primers, respectively. The objectives were to compare RFLP and RAPD markers with regard to their (1) sampling variance, (2) rank correlations of genetic distance among sub-samples, and (3) inheritance. A bootstrap procedure was used to generate 200 random samples of size n (n=2,3,5,... 55) independently from the RAPD and RFLP data sets. The coefficient of variance (CV) was estimated for each sample. Pooled regressions of the coefficient of variance on bootstrap sample size indicated that the rate of decrease in CV with increasing sample size was the same for RFLPs and RAPDs. The rank correlation between the Nei-Li genetic similarity values for all pairs of genotypes (990) based on RFLP and RAPD data was 0.745. Differences were observed between the RFLP and RAPD dendrograms of the 45 genotypes. Overlap in the distributions of rank correlations between independent sub-samples from the RAPD data set, compared to correlations between RFLP and RAPD sub-samples, suggest that observed differences in estimation of genetic similarity between RAPDs and RFLPs is largely due to sampling error rather than due to DNA-based differences in how RAPDs and RFLPs reveal polymorphisms. A crossing algorithm was used to generate hypothetical banding patterns of hybrids based on the genotypes of the parents. The results of this study indicate that RAPDs provide a level of resolution equivalent to RFLPs for detemination of the genetic relationships among genotypes. © 1994, Springer-Verlag.

Most (77-80%) of the total (phenotypic) variation in growth traits occurred within families. The genetic variation between families within localities (within c. 10 krn; 13-15% of the total variation), between localities within regions (within c. 100-150 km; c:4%) and between regions (3-8%) was generally highly significant. However, regional and locality components together accounted for only a small proportion of the total phenotypic variation. Little differentiation was detected between separate sampling sites within localities. Estimates of individual narrow-sense heritabilities were markedly higher than previous reports and were 0.38 for conic volume and 0.41 for height at 4 years, assuming a coefficient of relatedness of 0.4 amongst open-pollinated sibs. On average, progenies from the Otway Ranges region were the fastest growing at the test site, followed by those from King Island. Parent trees with high breeding values were concentrated in the Otway Ranges, Strzelecki Ranges and far southeastem Tasmania with the Bass Strait island localities having intermediate frequencies. Forest fragmentation through clearing for agriculture appears to have had a deleterious effect on the quantitative genetic structure of intergrade populations consistent with high levels of inbreeding. Remnant populations tended to have higher levels of severely abnormal seedlings, higher mortality and poorer growth, and higher heritability estimates and variability both within and between families. Advanced generation hybridisation and inbreeding due to long periods of isolation in small, relict populations may also have had similar effects. Populations sampled are, therefore, likely to have markedly different levels of inbreeding which may have inflated differences between localities and may have important consequences for the exploitation of this material for breeding. © 1994 CSIRO.

A potential problem with the use of such crops is the possibility of insects adapting to overcome the resistance mechanism. Strategies to minimize this risk have included concepts of seed mixtures and crop rotations. This may involve genotypes transformed with a series of genes encoding different resistance mechanisms and/or manipulating the manner in which these genes are expressed. The aim of this paper is to put these strategies into perspective with respect to the limitations imposed by the nature of plant transformation, the traditional approaches to plant breeding for cultivar development and seed marketing options for commercial release of transgenic crops.

Ten accessions from recently acquired germplasm were investigated for ploidy level. Eight were tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) and two were hexaploid (2n = 6x = 60). This is the first report of tetraploid plants in P. durifolium. The 4x accession Q?3947 was chosen for cytological and embryological studies. It showed regular meiosis with primarily bivalent chromosome pairing. Embryological surveys demonstrated that this tetraploid reproduces sexually. Studies on pollen germination and pollen tube growth, after self and after open pollination, suggest that the tetraploid cytotype has a genetic system to prevent self?fertilization. A controlled interspecific hybrid (2n = 3x = 30) was obtained among diploid P. intermedium (genome formula II) and tetraploid P. durifolium. The mean meiotic chromosome association for the hybrid was 8.7 I, 7.5 II, and 2.1 III with a range per cell of 514 I, 410 II, and 05 III. These results indicate that the parents of the hybrid have one homologous genome. However, some chromosomes of the P. intermedium genome may have some residual homology with chromosomes of the second genome of P. durifolium. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Burd M.,Bateman's principal and plant reproduction: the role of pollen limitation in fruit and seed set,1994,Botanical Review,60,1,,83,139,,316,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028562313&partnerID=40&md5=732e0802a3ea41bc32d78f8021b61569,"Dept Botany, Univ of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","Burd, M., Dept Botany, Univ of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA","Bateman's prinicpal states that male fitness is usually limited by the number of matings achieved, while female fitness is usually limited by the resources available for reproduction. When applied to flowering plants this principle leads to the expectation that pollen limitation of fruit and seed set will be uncommon, but if male searching for mates (including pollen dissemination via external agents) is not sufficiently successful, then the reproductive success of both sexes (or both sex functions in hermaphroditic plants) will be limited by number of matings rather than by resources, and Bateman's principal cannot be expected to apply. Using published data on 258 species in which fecundity was reported for natural pollination and hand pollination with outcross pollen, the author found significant pollen limitation at some times or in some sites in 159 species (62%). Nor is the pollination environment constant. Across species, supplemental pollen leads to increased fruit set more often than increased seed set within fruits, pointing to the importance of gamete packaging strategies in plant reproduction. Highly self-incompatible species obtain a greater benefit relative to natural pollination from artificial application of excess outcross pollen than do self-compatible species, suggesting that inadequate pollen receipt is a primary cause of low fecundity rates in perennial plants, which are often self-incompatible. Because flowering plants often allocate considerable resources to pollinator attraction, both export and receipt of pollen could be limited primarily by resource investment in floral advertisement and rewards. Whatever investment is made in attraction, pollinator behavioural stochasticity usually produces wide variation among flowers in reproductive success through both male and female functions: the optimal deployment of resources among megaspores, microspores, and pollinator attraction may often require more flowers or more ovules per flower than will usually be fertilized, in order to benefit from chance fluctuations that bring in large number of pollen grains. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028562313

Capsules from the lower (first?formed five capsules), upper (last five fully?developed capsules) and middle portions were harvested separately and the frequency of appearance of progenies with dominant markers was used as the criterion for NCP. The degree of inter?genotypic NCP was similar in the three genotypes and at the two locations (4.025.10 % NCP) when the total number of hybrid seeds per plant was considered. The lower portion of the early (1.031.31 % NCP) and medium (1.512.08%) flowering genotypes and the upper portion of the late?flowering genotype (2.272.49 % NCP) recorded less NCP than the total plant. The NCP in the lower portion of the early?flowering genotype due to pollen from the late?flowering genotype was negligible (00.7 %). The results indicate the need for controlled self?pollination for purity maintenance in sesame. However, contamination due to NCP can be reduced by sampling seeds from the lower capsules of early and medium?flowering genotypes and from the upper capsules of late?maturing genotypes when pollination control is not practised.

This paper examines this aspect of fig ? fig wasp biology. The flight speed of insects is closely linked to their size, and directional flight is difficult for small insects, such as fig wasps, in all but the lightest of winds. We investigated the movements of fig wasps between trees using sticky traps placed around fig trees or near cotton bags containing figs. Away from the trees, the densities of flying wasps at different heights was also determined. When the wasps disperse from their natal figs they take off near?vertically. They are unable to exert directional control once they enter the air column and are subsequently blown downwind. Near receptive host trees the wasps appear to lose height and then fly upwind at speeds of around 25 cm/sec. 1994 The Netherlands Entomological Society",Agaonidae; attractants; dispersal; Ficus; flight; wind,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028183714

Patterns of activity at a large nesting aggregation and at foraging sites are described for females of the solitary bee Anthophora plumipes (Pallas). Changes in the quality and quantity of the resource collected by females provisioning cells are related to variation in female body mass and microclimate. Activity at the nest site demonstrated relationships with aspects of the thermal environment experienced by A.plumipes. Measures of temperature showing significant relationships differed for females in different stages in the nesting cycle exhibiting characteristically different behaviour patterns. Larger females emerged from nest tunnels earlier in the morning and provisioned cells at lower ambient temperatures than smaller individuals. Body size therefore predicts reproductive success at low ambient temperatures. Pollen and nectar loads carried by females increased with ambient temperature. Because only one cell is completed per day and the size of offspring is determined by the quality and quantity of resource provided by the mother, the body size of individuals emerging in the following season will depend on interactions between climate and body size, in addition to any heritable component. Variation in activity levels at foraging sites is attributed not only to thermal considerations, but also to variation in the quality of rewards available at different floral sources.

The calli were then transferred into a liquid medium of the same composition, in which they turned into compact cell clumps which consisted of meristematic nodules.

No significant difference was found between the performance of offspring from pollinations by neighbouring plants and offspring pollinated by plants further apart but within the same population. A lower fitness of offspring from pollinations between neighbours would be expected if these matings, on average, yielded inbred offspring which suffered from inbreeding depression. These results imply that either a tight neighbourhood structuring is not present, or that the inbreeding depression for offspring by neighbours is too low to detect, although these are inbred. Crossings between populations produced offspring with a significantly higher fitness than offspring sired within populations. There were no significant differences in response to inbreeding among the populations, and differences in mean fitness among populations had no clear relation to the population size or degree of isolation.

From analyses of 5-allelic interactions in heterozygous plants which were generated from cross-pollinations between plants possessing different 5-alleles, a linear dominance hierarchy with six levels has been established among 28 5-alleles in both pollen and stigma.

The diversity of the multiple 5-alleles observed in the present study also suggests that the southern area of Mexico to Guatemala is a centre of genetic variation in diploid I. trifida. © 1994 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Allele frequency; Allelic interaction; Dominance relationship; Ipomoea trifida; S-alleles; Sporophytic self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028050808

In contrast, nectar sugar concentrations of other hummingbird flowers on Caribbean islands are 17-37% and those of Puerto Rico visited by the C. falcata pollinator have standing crops averaging 2.0-6.2 ?l and daily secretion rates of 3.1-10.6 ?l. In the Toro Negro Forest Reserve, in 1991, the authors clipped the spur tips of all flowers at one site rendering them nectarless. Visitation frequencies and measures of male and female fitness were adjusted for site differences in pollinator activity, and all were significantly lower at the site where flowers were nectarless. In 1992, the authors abandoned one site and manipulated the other by clipping the floral spurs of a randomly chosen subset of plants so that 25% of the flowers in the population were nectarless. Pollinarium removals from intact flowers were significantly different from those with cut spurs and total visits were nearly significant as well. However, the difference in female success was not significant between the two treatments. Number of visits per flower dropped dramatically from previous years despite the highest level of bird activity yet censused. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that the pollinator (Puerto Rican emerald Chlorostilbon maugaeus) perceives the nectar reward despite its small quantity and low sugar content, this to the advantage of Comparettia flacata. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028571697

All flowers of these species are potentially bisexual in function and male flowers result when pistil development ceases after floral initiation. All male flowers possess vestigial pistils. The proportion of male flowers within three populations was recorded over three seasons. In both species, the proportion of male relative to bisexual flowers increased as the flowering season progressed. A strong relationship exists between flower sex and branch position, with bisexual flowers tending to occur on upper and outer positions on plants. Fruit set is not limited by pollination but by some other resource, possibly nutrients. Whilst andromonoecy sets the upper Limit of the number of fruit which may be formed, the number of fruit set on a plant is always less than the number of bisexual flowers. It is suggested that andromonoecy in L. myrsinoides and L. continentale is an evolutionary response to low resource availability allowing optimal resource allocation to reproduction in these species. © 1994 CSIRO.

Burd M.,Batemans principle and plant reproduction: The role of pollen limitation in fruit and seed set,1994,The Botanical Review,60,1,,83,139,,338,10.1007/BF02856594,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028008070&doi=10.1007%2fBF02856594&partnerID=40&md5=2c794c2f5a174d009e62ccda2b8e0c9b,"Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, 53706-1381, United States","Burd, M., Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, 53706-1381, United States","Batemans principle states that male fitness is usually limited by the number of matings achieved, while female fitness is usually limited by the resources available for reproduction. When applied to flowering plants this principle leads to the expectation that pollen limitation of fruit and seed set will be uncommon. However, if male searching for mates (including pollen dissemination via external agents) is not sufficiently successful, then the reproductive success of both sexes (or both sex functions in hermaphroditic plants) will be limited by number of matings rather than by resources, and Batemans principle cannot be expected to apply. Limitation of female success due to inadequate pollen receipt appears to be a common phenomenon in plants. Using published data on 258 species in which fecundity was reported for natural pollination and hand pollination with outcross pollen, I found significant pollen limitation at some times or in some sites in 159 of the 258 species (62%). When experiments were performed multiple times within a growing season, or in multiple sites or years, the statistical significance of pollen limitation commonly varied among times, sites or years, indicating that the pollination environment is not constant. There is some indication that, across species, supplemental pollen leads to increased fruit set more often than increased seed set within fruits, pointing to the importance of gamete packaging strategies in plant reproduction. Species that are highly self-incompatible obtain a greater benefit relative to natural pollination from artificial application of excess outcross pollen than do self-compatible species. This suggests that inadequate pollen receipt is a primary cause of low fecundity rates in perennial plants, which are often self-incompatible. Because flowering plants often allocate considerable resources to pollinator attraction, both export and receipt of pollen could be limited primarily by resource investment in floral advertisement and rewards. But whatever investment is made is attraction, pollinator behavioral stochasticity usually produces wide variation among flowers in reproductive success through both male and female functions. In such circumstances the optimal deployment of resources among megaspores, microspores, and pollinator attraction may often require more flowers or more ovules per flower than will usually be fertilized, in order to benefit from chance fluctuations that bring in large number of pollen grains. Maximizing seed set for the entire plant in a stochastic pollination environment might thus entail a packaging strategy for flower number or ovule number per flower that makes pollen limitation of fruit or seed set likely. Pollen availability may limit female success in individual flowers, entire plants (in a season or over a lifetime), or populations. The appropriate level must be distinguished depending on the nature of the question being addressed. © 1994, The New York Botanical Garden. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028008070

The large C. aquatica chromosomes could be distinguished from the small C. gigantea chromosomes in the F1 hybrids. Formation of 5 heteromorphic bivalents suggests strong homologies between the chromosomes of the two species which indicates that the C. gigantea genome has 2 sets of 5 chromosomes each, one of which is homologous to the C. aquatica genome. Occurrence of association of 3 chromosomes (2 C. gigantea on either side of C. aquatica) and intragenomic bivalents in C. gigantea suggest that the second genome is partially homologous to the first one and to that of C. aquatica. Formation of associations of 3 and a bridge and a fragment at anaphase I suggest that the two genomes are differentiated by at least one translocation and one inversion.

Intraspecific crossability between 2x female and 4x male cytotypes was investigated using classical methods of crossing in P. almum, P. brunneum, P. rufum, P. intermedium and P. quadrifarium. Expected triploid BII hybrids were obtained in P. intermedium (crossability:0.004%) and in P. brunneum (crossability:0.015%). In P. rufum, only tetraploid BIII hybrids were achieved with a crossability of 0.025% Looking for a better performance, in vitro ovary rescue was attempted 5 days after pollination in intraspecific 2x × 4x crosses of P. almum, P. quadrifarium, P. intermedium and P. rufum. The method was useful to recover some triploid BII hybrids in P. almum (success rate:0.49%) and in P. rufum (0.59%), but failed in P. intermedium and P. quadrifarium. Pollen tube growth was usually inhibited at the stigma or style levels after self-pollination in 2x plants, confirming that diploids are self-incompatible. Pollen of 4x cytotypes germinated and penetrated the pistils of diploid conspecific cytotypes. This indicated that no incompatibility system exists in these species to keep the 2x cytotypes from hybridising with 4x conspecific cytotypes as pollen donors. However, after pollination of 2x cytotypes with pollen of 4x counterparts, most ovules showed embryo and endosperm development, but a few days later, endosperms collapsed and embryos stopped their development. As a result of these processes, sexual self-incompatible 2x cytotypes of Paspalum species produced very few triploid hybrids when pollinated with pollen of their apomictic 4x counterparts. Thus, the low diploid-tetraploid crossability was due to the existence of a post-zygotic abortive system and not caused by pre-fertilisation barriers. © 1994 CSIRO.

Results of the palynological analysis of the interval 2-158 m with sample distances of 1 m are presented. Time control of the Funza II core is based on zircon fission-track datings of intercalated volcanic ash horizons. In addition, pollen r cord Funza II could be correlated in detail with pollen record Funza I, located at 1 km distance. The Funza I pollen record has been graphically correlated with the oxygen isotope record of ODP Site 677 (East Pacific). Oxygen isotope stages 19.1 to 3.0 have been tentatively recognized in the pollen record, indicating that the interval 158-2 m represents approximately the period of 735-28 ka. The average calculated time resolution is 4550 yr with considerable fluctuations depending changes in accumulation rate. The interval 158-131 m core depth (estimated age 735-569 ka) shows warm climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 19.1 to 15.1. The pollen spectra have no direct modern analogues because of the absence of Quercus and related conditions. The upper forest line oscillated mainly from 2100 to 2700 m during most of the interval. The corresponding average annual temperature on the high plain is 6.5-11°C. The high plain was situated in the Andean forest belt most of the time. The upper limit of the subandean forest belt (Acalypha, Alchornea) was situated some hundreds of meters below the modern elevation. Podocarpus was most important in the lower part of the Andean forest belt. Weinmannia forest, the precursor of the modern Weinmannietum, included a substantial contribution of Hedyosmum as well as lower frequencies of Myrsine (= Rapanea) and Eugenia. A type of Vallea-Miconia forest, including low frequencies of Ilex and Myrsine (= Rapanea), could have occurred on the drier parts of the high plain. The lake was shallow most of the time, with local marsh vegetation of cyperaceous reed swamp and Hydrocotyle. Myrica thickets M. parvifolia) a nd Alnus carr (swamp forest) covered the wet flats around the lake. Myrica (M. pubescens) and Alnus possibly contributed also with low frequency to the zonal Andean forest belt. Dwarf forest of Polylepis, Myrica and Compositae scrub occurred at the upper forest line. The interval 131-100 m core depth (estimated age 569-350 ka) shows cold climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with oxygen isotope stages 14.4 to 11.1. The upper forest line oscillated mainly from 1800 to 2500 m. The corresponding average temperature on the high plain is ca. 5-9.5°C. The high plain was situated in the grassparamo belt most of the time. Apart from Gramineae (e.g. Calamagrostis, Chusquea) and woody stem rosettes of Espeletia (Compositae) a variety of paramo herbs (Valeriana, Caryophyllaceae, Geranium, Aragoa, Lycopodium) were present with substantial frequencies, and abundant cushion bogs of Plantago were present. The water level in the lake was high and marsh vegetation limited. Polylepis dwarf forest occurred in the subparamo belt, along with shrub of Compositae, Hypericum and Ericaceae. In the Andean forest belt Vallea-Miconia forest and Weinmannia-Hedyosmum forest were most important. The interval 100-57 m core depth (estimated age 350-186 ka) shows warm climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 10.2 to 7.1. The upper forest line oscillated from 2000 to 2600 m in the first part and from 2600 to 2900 m in the last of this interval. The corresponding average annual temperature is 6-10° and 10-12°C, respectively. The high plain was in the first part of this interval most of the time situated in the paramo and in the last part of this interval in the Andean forest belt. During this interval Quercus migrated into the area of the high plain. Quercus forests occurred in a wide altitudinal range (1000-2800 m) and constituted at first local patches of forest, but at the end of this interval zonal Quercus forests were a major part of the Andean forest belt. Acalypha and Alchornea reached higher elevations in the Quercus forests, and the upper limit of subandean forest rose to modern elevations. Weinmannia dominated in the Weinmannia-Hedyosnum forest type. At the end of this interval the contribution of Vellea-Miconia forest increased markedly and replaced Weinmannia forest. Podocarpus-rich forest occurred in the lower part of the Andean forest belt. Alnus carr and Myrica thickets were abundant around the lake, which was of a shallow type. Algae (Botryococcus) became very abundant from the beginning of this interval to the top of the record. The interval 57-2 m core depth (estimated age 186-24 ka) shows for the first time in the record abundant presence of zonal Quercus forests. The composition of the Andean forest belt had changed dramatically. Based on arboreal percentages, climatic conditions seem warm most of the time, but the high frequency of Quercus, a wind-pollinated tree that produces large amounts of pollen, exaggerates real conditions. This is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 6 to 3.0. The forest line oscillated from 2000 to 3000 m most of the time. The corresponding average annual temperature is 6-12.5°C. Quercus forests, resembling the modern Saurauia-Quercus humboldtii forest, and Weinmannia-Hedyosmum forest, resembling the modern Weinmannietum, dominated in the Andean forest belt. Vallea-Miconia forest probably resembled the modern Xylosma-Duranta-Vallea forest, but the latter is palynologically difficult to recognize. Eugenia, Ilex and Myrsine (= Rapanea) contributed substantially to this rather dry forest type of low stature. Polylepis dwarf forest was frequent at the forest line and possibly also in the paramo belt up to 4000 m. Alnus carr dominated completely the flat parts of the high plain. Myrica thickets and marsh vegetation diminished in the last part of this period. Sediment accumulation was very rapid (up to 60 cm per 1000 yr). Supposedly, erosion of the Tequendama Falls in the Bogotá River, the only outlet of the high plain, led to the final draining of the lake between ca. 28 and 22 ka. The Andean biozones VI and VII are represented in this part of the record. Biozone VI (158-94 m core interval; estimated age 735-350 ka) is characterized by the presence of Alnus and absence of Quercus. Biozone VII (94-0 m core interval; estimated age 350-0 ka) is characterized by the presence of Alnus and Quercus, both from northern hemisphere origin. © 1994.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028588893

Further development was signalled by clumping of the carpels as the underlying tissue expanded. The time taken to reach fruit maturity from this 'take-off' point was found to be 15-21 weeks. Fruit growth was double sigmoidal. Maturity could be reliably detected when the density of the spurs on the fruit surface reached a minimum value (6 per 12 cm2) and a slight paling of the initially darkgreen skin occurred. This lightening of the skin probably reflected declining chlorophyll concentrations which fell to about 15% of their initial value. Mature fruit produced a biphasic respiratory climacteric, with CO2 production reaching 100 ml kg-1 h-1 and then 350 ml kg-1 h-1 at 25-30°C. Peak ethylene production (250-350 ml kg-1 h-1) occurred between the two respiratory maxima. The respiratory climacteric of harvested immature fruit tended to be higher and later than that of mature fruit. © 1994.",Annona muricata; Fruit growth; Guanabana; Maturity; Ripening; Soursop,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027947751

Box 16, Wageningen, 6700 AA, Netherlands","Flavonols form an important class of flavonoids which serve an essential function during plant reproduction. Flavonoid biosynthesis is initiated by the enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS). A high abundance of flavonols and chs mRNA was demonstrated in male and female reproductive organs of Petunia hybrida. Detailed analyses revealed precise spatial and temporal regulation of the chs promoter and flavonol synthesis in the stigma, style and ovules. Transgenic plants were generated with a complete block of flavonol biosynthesis as the result of anti?sense inhibition of chs gene activity. The absence of flavonols by this dominant mutation rendered these plants self?sterile. Pollination experiments with wild?type and mutant plants revealed that the production of flavonols in either the anthers or the pistils was required for pollen tube growth and seed set. Mutant pollen without flavonols in their exine germinated normally. However, after a short period of in vitro pollen tube growth the tips of these tubes disrupted and the protoplasm was disloaded leading to the death of the pollen grain. Addition of flavonol aglycones but not other flavonoids complemented this phenotype. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the localization of high levels of flavonols throughout the wild?type pollen tube. These compounds were not detected in the exine or cell wall of growing tubes. In addition, it was observed that the flavone apigenin could completely inhibit pollen tube growth. Taken together, it is shown that flavonols play an important role in the growth of the pollen tube and their mode of action is discussed. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Percent fruit set was found to be approximately equivalent to the additive inverse of percent aborted flowers, as the effect of shot berries was small and not significant. In interspecific crosses, barriers were manifested as reduced fruit set and seed number per berry. These two characters were used to create an index of reproductive efficiency. Nine F1s from crosses of most divergent class, V. riparia × V. vinifera (R × V), displayed significantly tower reproductive efficiency, percent fruit set, and seed number per berry. Four female F1s from the least divergent class, V. riparia × V. riparia (R × R), had the highest reproductive efficiency, percent fruit set and seed number per berry, when pollinated by two V. riparia pollen sources. Seventeen F1s from the highly-intercrossed class, V. riparia × French Hybrid (R × FH), displayed intermediate levels of reproductive efficiency, percent fruit set, and seed number per berry. The R × FH class involved V. vinifera, V. rupestris, V. aestivalis, V. labrusca, V. berlandieri, V. cinerea, and V. riparia. It is proposed that the complex intercrossing in the pedigrees of the R × FH class ameliorated incongruity. In the most divergent class, R × V, progenies of one of the V. riparia parents displayed fewer incongruity effects than progenies of the other V. riparia parents. Progeny testing of many proposed parental combinations may be used to uncover useful congruent combinations. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",grapes; incongruity; interspecific barriers; interspecific hybridization; reproductive efficiency; Vitis spp.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028312048

Merced was studied using eight polymorphic isozyme loci as genetic markers and two progeny samples from a large population: 20 emasculated mother plants (obligately cross-pollinating) and 100 non-emasculated mother plants. Merced rye showed a significant frequency of self-fertilization (s=1-t) in a previous generation, but in the generation under study the outcrossing frequency was not significantly different from t = 1. This fact suggests that environmental factors can affect the rate of outcrossing vs. selfing (self-fertilization). In spite of the outcrossing rate of t= 1, the large progenies from emasculated plants (100 seeds per plant) demonstrated that pollination was not completely at random. This represents a violation of the generally accepted mixed-mating model on which most methods used to estimate mating parameters are based. Temporal heterogeneity and the differential ability of gametophytes to fertilize are possible causes of the non-randomness of mating. It is concluded that, although violations of the assumption of the mixed-mating model can bias the estimates, most of the estimated outcrossing values clearly differ from complete outcrossing. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Isozymes; Mating-system; Mixed-mating model; Rye; Secale cereale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028165693

First, isolation experiments failed to confirm the existence of a widespread, truly self-compatible and predominantly self-pollinating breeding system in Israeli populations of S. vernalis. However, a single S. vernalis plant derived from a natural stand at Jerusalem was found to be self-compatible and strongly self-pollinating. In its progeny, there were signs of inbreeding depression commonly associated with selfed offspring of outbreeding species. Selfing ability ratios in this progeny indicate a single dominant gene for selfing ability in S. vernalis. The implications of these observations for the origin of S. vulgaris are briefly discussed. Second, the occurrence of gynodioecy in S. vernalis populations from Israel is reported. Although male sterile plants are recognizable by the complete absence of pollen on their exposed stigmas, there probably exists a large amount of variation within and between plants for pollen production. Infertile pollen grains of male steriles differ in size, shape, and sculpturing from those of hermaphrodites. At the Mt. of Olives, in Jerusalem, the frequency of male steriles was found to be 9.1%. There is some preliminary evidence for differences in floret (= ovule) number between the two gender tvpes. Although the inheritance of male sterility appears to be predominantly cytoplasmically controlled, additional mechanisms restoring male fertility have to be postulated to account for the data observed in one of the crosses. The male sterility system in 5. vernalis should therefore be referred to as nuclear-cytoplasmic.© 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027966581

Cultivated ryegrass (L. perenne and L. multiflorum), meadow fescue, and the annual L. rigidum, are true outbreeders. The other species are true inbreeders, except for L. canariense, which shows a moderate level of cross fertilisation (20%). Hierarchical clustering from Nei's unbiased distance leads to four groups. The three self-pollinating, weed species, L. temulentum, L. remotum and L. persicum, belong to the first cluster, which is the most differentiated one. The second cluster comprises L. multiflorum, L. subulatum and most populations of L. rigidum. All L. perenne populations belong to the third cluster, as do two of L. rigidum. The average genetic distance within the L. perenne group is very low. Surprisingly, the fourth cluster groups together L. canariense and Festuca pratensis. The data suggest that L. rigidum is the species with the greatest diversity, and could be a common ancestor of the genus.

During the planning and design stage, the wide genotypic variation in natural plant populations must be recognized and exploited. This will ensure that genotypes used on a site are best adapted to local conditions and have a greater probability of survivorship than arbitrarily chosen material. Also, certain unusual genotypes can be located using the principles of evolutionary ecology and can be installed in areas with extreme conditions, such as soils contaminated with heavy metals, in areas where rapid colonizing ability (high seed set and/or clonal growth) is particularly advantageous, or where soils are of poor quality. Similarly, where high herbivore pressure is a threat to restoration, genotypes that are well defended, chemically or mechanically, against animal enemies should be selected to initiate the restoration process. The nursery industry can be encouraged to supply an ecologically wider selection of material for restoration, originating from local biological reserves and natural habitats. During the management phase of a restoration, local natural habitats are critical as reservoirs of biological control agents, seed sources for plant species, and members of higher trophic levels and additional plant species needed during succession. Mutualists such as pollinators, seed dispersers, and mycorrhizal fungi are vital to the success of a restoration project, and these must invade from nearby natural habitats or must be deliberately introduced. During the evaluation phase of restoration, local natural areas should be used as templates of community composition and structure from which one measures success. A functioning restoration project will interact biologically with surrounding areas, the exchange of species and genes being particularly important. Analysis of the microbial and invertebrate communities that have invaded the installed plant community may be useful and accurate determinants of ecological function. For these latter stages of the restoration process, the value of preserving local habitat remnants is high and complements their usefulness as a source of ecologically precise material for installation.

Tropical flower visitors take an amount comparable to herbivores, exceeding 3% of net primary production energy. Therefore herbivory and aboveground net primary production have been underestimated. Comparing pollinators to other herbivores, harvest in mature forest by tropical bees is greater than leafcutter ants, game animals, frugivores, vertebrate folivores, insect defoliators excluding ants, flower-feeding birds and bats, but not soil organisms. The ratio of total aboveground net primary production to investment in pollen, nectar and resin used by pollinators suggests wind pollination is several times more efficient in temperate forests than is animal pollination in neotropical moist forest. Animal pollination may be favoured by habitat mosaics and an unpredictable or sparse dispersion of conspecifics - consequences of fluctuating abiotic and biotic environments. Natural selection evidently favours diminished direct reproductive costs in forests, for example by wind pollination, regardless of latitude and disturbance regime. An example is ""wind pollination by proxy"" of dominant trees in seasonal southeast Asian forests. They flower only occasionally and their pollen is dispersed by tiny winged insects that are primarily carried by the wind - rather than the nectar-hungry bees, bats, birds and moths used by most tropical flora. Increasing evapotranspiration is associated with greater net primary production; I show its correlation with species richness of social tropical bees across the isthmus of Panama, which may indicate increasing forest reproductive effort devoted to flowering, and its monopolization by unspecialized flower visitors in wetter and less seasonal lowland forests. © 1993 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Bees; forest reproduction; pollinators; primary production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027704728

Pollen source was controlled by hand-pollinating flowers with cross- or self-pollen. Resource availability to developing fruits was controlled by adjusting fruit loads (heavy versus light) on each plant and exposing plants to different photoperiod cycles (16 vs 12 h of light; short days favor fruit growth at the expense of vegetative growth). In mature fruits the proportion of ovules expanding (showing some development over virgin ovules) ranged from 89-95% and did not increase with resource availability, suggesting that unexpanded ovules were either unfertilized or obligately aborted shortly after fertilization. The proportion of expanded ovules maturing in mature fruits was near 97% for both self- and crosspollinations in the treatment with highest resource availability (light load, short days) and lower in the remaining treatments, where self-pollination resulted in up to 9% lower seed maturation than cross-pollination. In the latter three treatments a pollen source effect was dependent upon the maternal plant; in some plants selfing increased abortion and in others it did not. Collectively, the results suggest that (1) both pollen source and resource availability affect ovule abortion, (2) at least some abortion is facultative, and (3) when resources are limited, self-pollination increases abortion in some but not all maternal plants. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Cassia fasciculata; Ovule abortion; Pollination; Resources,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027870930

The species assemblage is depauperate, and long-tongued pollinators are absent or rare on the islands. Bumblebees, one of the most important pollinators in Japan, are generally absent. Plants depending strongly on bumblebee pollination are absent on Izu Islands, but those depending on varied pollinators including bumblebees display smaller flower sizes and accommodate smaller pollinators than their mainland counterparts. Breeding systems of these species also shift to partial inbreeding, possibly an evolutionary result of the decrease in pollinator availability. Changes in flowering phenology between mainland and island populations also occur. Plants in the islands tend to reproduce vegetatively less frequently and produce greater numbers of smaller seeds than those in the mainland. The possibility of evolution on the side of island pollinator species is also discussed, although there are few data on this topic. © 1993 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Bombus; evolution of plant characteristics; island populations; pollination; pollinator availability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027704807

Br.) Merr., a locally abundant dioecious tree pollinated by small, unspecialized insects in northern Queensland rain forest, Australia. The population consisted of a clustered group of trees with a mean male-to-female distance of 4.5 m and more isolated individuals, including females more than 90 m away from the nearest pollen source. A map of all reproductive trees was produced to determine accurate male-to-female distances. The size of the pollen source available to females was defined as a function of the distance to the nearest ten male trees and their sizes (male neighbourhood index). The rate of pollen movement to females was measured by counting pollen tubes (and the number of tubes per style) in female trees 6 days after the commencement of population flowering. The pollination rate decreased steeply to less than half when the nearest male was only 6.5 m away. Although pollen reached a female 330 m away from the nearest pollen source, only 10% of receptive flowers had been pollinated. The short flowering period (2-3 weeks) combined with the the slow rate of pollen movement means that a large proportion of flowers in isolated trees are unpollinated, confirming an earlier finding that isolated females set fewer fruits than gregarious females. The reliability of pollen transfer to females was determined by quantifying insects and their pollen loads trapped at female trees with a range of male neighbourhood indices. Quantities of insects and pollen were significantly correlated with the size of the male neighbourhood index, indicating a strong density-dependent response by vectors to flowering. Pollen was also collected from insect visitors to non-flowering trees. Females with large male neighbourhood indices received more pollen than non-flowering trees with equivalent male neighbourhood indices. However, when the male neighbourhood indices were small for both female and non-flowering trees, the changces of pollinators encountering female and non-flowering trees were similar, suggesting random movements of pollinators in sparse-flowering sub-populations. The dioecious breeding system, brief, synchronous flowering period, clustered population structure and random, opportunistic foraging behaviour of vectors interacted in a way that reduced reproduction in relatively isolated trees. These results demonstrate a mechanism for differential breeding success between trees in natural populations and emphasize the possible impact of logging regimes on pollen flow between trees. Large interconspecific distances in species-rich environments may have been a factor in the selection for synchronous flowering between trees in outcrossing tree species with generalist insect pollinators. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Insect density; Male neighbourhood index; Pollen density; Pollination success; Tree density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027333454

During a heavy flowering almost half the mature individuals and over 80% of the canopy and emergent tree Species in a forest may flower. This involves over 200 tree species in a forest flowering over a short period of 3-4 months. The pollination needs during a mass flowering appears to be overcome in several ways. A rapid increase in the number of pollinators seems to occur in the forest. This is partly caused by the migration of pollinators from the fringes of the forest to forage on the superabundance of flowers. At the same time, some groups of plants which share common pollinators appear to reduce pollinator competition by flowering in interspecific sequence. Many members of the family Dipterocarpaceae have evolved sequential flowering too. They also share unique pollinators, common flower thrips which appear to build up rapidly in numbers by feeding and breeding on the millions of dipterocarp flower buds which are present several weeks before the flowering. The environmental cue for this irregular, but widespread mass flowering can be traced to a small dip of about 2° C below mean night-time temperature for 4 or 5 nights. The conditions for such temperature drops occur during El Nino events. © 1993 Indian Academy of Sciences.",dipterocarps; environmental cue; Mass flowering; pollinators; sequential flowering; thrips,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027705298

In this study, we investigated the role of four sequential factors which may differentially influence fruit and seed set in the two floral morphs: (1) differences in flowering phenology, (2) a limitation of pollen transfer towards pins, (3) a differential capacity of the two morphs to act through famale and male function and (4) differential fruit abortion in the two morphs. Fruit set was significantly influenced by differences in flowering phenology although there were no differences in flowering time between the two morphs. supplementary pollinations in a natural population significantly increased fruit set and reduced the difference in fruit set between the two morphs in relation to controls, indicating a limitation on pollen transfer which was most severe towards pin stigmas. In reciprocal crosses, seed set was significantly dependent on the paternal and maternal identity of the pin parent. There was no significant variation among thrums for their performance as male or female parent. Furthermore, individual pin plants with relatively high percentage seed set as female parents gave poor seed set as male parents and vice-versa. Whereas fruit removal had no effect on seed number in thrum plants, a greater proportion of viable seeds were produced on pin plants which were left to naturally mature their fruits than on pins which had fruits artificially removed, suggesting the occurrence of selective fruit abortion in pins but not in thrums. The initially greater maternal fitness of thrums due to their greater success as pollen recipients may thus be opposed by increased viable seed set in the pins due to factors acting after the pollination stage. The relative reproductive success of floral morphs in the distylous J. fruticans is thus differentially influenced by ecological factors occurring at different stages of the reproductive process. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Distyly; Jasminum; Phenology; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027802809

In order to identify factors associated with systemic allergic reactions, a prospective study was conducted from 1976-1989 with more than 10,000 patients being tested and a total of 513,368 injections being recorded. Our study showed that the probability of inducing systemic allergic reactions by skin testing was less than 0.02% and the probability of systemic allergic reactions caused by immunotherapy was 2.9%. The female to male ratio was 3 to 2. The highest incidence of systemic allergic reactions was in patients between the ages of 16 to 39 years of age. The majority of systemic allergic reactions occurred when patients were on increasing doses rather than maintenance doses. More than 95% of systemic allergic reactions were associated with pollens and most of them happened between the concentration of 100 and 1000 PNU/mL. There was no increased incidence during grass or ragweed pollination seasons in those patients who received grass or ragweed injections during the respective seasons. Only 50% of systemic allergic reactions developed within 30 minutes after injections. The three most important factors determining the incidence of systemic allergic reactions are the type of allergens, the 'rate' of increase of allergen concentrations, and sensitivity of the patients to allergens. The prick test at initial allergy assessment can be used to 'rule out,' with a high degree of certainty, the likelihood of systemic allergic reactions. The prick test is easy to perform and it is cost-effective. Prick tests and RAST together are helpful in identifying the patients and the allergens at higher risk of systemic allergic reactions.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027733605

The geographical situation of Palencia, in the interior of Spain, results in higher percentages of Poaceae and Quercus. The enormous pollution of Huelva favors the greater development of the Urticaceae family and the greater presence of its pollen in the air.",allergenic pollen; pollen of the mediterranean area; pollination in Spain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027788174

Inbred lines are usually developed by self-pollination, and inbreeding in maize is accompanied by a reduction in the mean phenotypic value for most traits. The objectives of this study were to compare inbreeding depression rates of materials derived from older (pre-1960) and newer (post-1970) maize lines to determine if rate of inbreeding depression and fit of data to a linear model changed between the two groups of lines. Each group included six lines with B14A, B37, L289, L317, M14, and WF9 included in the older group and B73, B75, B76, B77, B79, and B84 included in the newer group. Nineteen generations within each of the two inbred groups representing nine levels of inbreeding (0 to 100% homozygosity at 12.5% intervals) were evaluated in 10 environments to determine rates of inbreeding depression for 15 plant and ear traits. The rates of inbreeding depression were similar for the two groups of lines for nine of the 15 traits. The rate of inbreeding depression was lower for tassel-branch number, ear-leaf width, number of ears per plant, ear length, ear diameter, and cob diameter in the newer lines, suggesting either that the newer lines were segregating at fewer loci than the older lines or that the frequency of favorable alleles was greater than 0.5. The reduction in the phenotypic means was negatively and linearly correlated with the coefficient of inbreeding for all traits except days to anthesis. The linear model explained 89% or more of the variation among the inbreeding level means for nine traits for both groups of lines.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027730342

Here I report an extraordinary case of pathogen-mediated floral mimicry that contributes to fungal reproduction. The rust fungus Puccinia monoica inhibits flowering in its host plants (Arabis species) and radically transforms host morphology, creating elevated clusters of infected leaves that mimic true flowers of unrelated species in shape, size, colour and nectar production. These fungal pseudoflowers attract insects which fertilize the rust. Because the pseudoflowers are highly successful in attracting pollinating insects, they may also affect the reproductive success of nearby flowering plants. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027341493

This variability is surprising because guayule reproduces by facultative apomixis (asexual reproduction by seed), but evidence suggests that progress through selection is feasible. It has been hypothesized that this variation has arisen through periodic sexual reproduction; however, this has not been quantified. This study was designed to describe and compare eight components of yield and the expression of two isozyme systems in twenty parent plants and half-sib, open-pollinated families from each parent. Extensive variation for all characters was found among both the parents and the progeny, with fresh and dry weights being highly correlated to rubber yield. Parent-offspring regressions were not significantly different from zero. This implies low heritabilities for the major components of yield in guayule, and we believe that family selection, rather than single-plant selection, may generate higher-yielding and more genetically uniform lines at an escalated rate than single-plant selection. Periodic sexuality resulting in genetic variation was estimated by differences in isozyme expression within the half-sib families. Fifteen of the twenty progeny families were polymorphic for either esterase or peroxidase or both isozymes. This amount of sexuality is significant, and guayule must be considered an open-pollinated crop. We conclude from this study that we should rethink our breeding procedures to include controlled pollination and family selection. © 1993 American Oil Chemists' Society.",Components of yield; esterase; facultative apomixis; family selection; genetic variation; heritability; isozyme polymorphisms; parent-offspring regressions; Parthenium argentatum; peroxidase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027816747

Pollen deposited on the stigmatic surface of a compatible plant germinates a pollen tube which penetrates the stigmatic papillae and grows intercellularly through the style towards the ovules in the ovary. Pollen tube growth is largely restricted to the transmitting tissue in the style. Therefore the stylar transmitting tissue is extremely important for the migration of the pollen cell towards the ovary. We have isolated two related cDNAs, transmitting tissue-specific (TTS)-1 and TTS-2, derived from two proline-rich protein (PRP)-encoding mRNAs that accumulate specifically in the transmitting tissue of tobacco. The deduced PRP sequences share similarities with proline-rich cell wall glycoproteins found in a variety of plants. TTS-1 and TTS-2 mRNAs are induced in very young floral buds, accumulate most abundantly during the later stages of flower development when style elongation is the most rapid, and remain at relatively high levels at anthesis. These mRNAs become undetectable in maturing green fruits. In situ hybridization shows that TTS-1 and TTS-2 mRNA accumulation is restricted to the transmitting tissue of the style.

The working hypothesis for bee foraging behavior in three dimensions is that forager experience can produce stratum fidelity, just as rewarding foraging produces floral fidelity. Wideranging search behavior should allow bees to track spatiotemporal distribution of resources. A systematic study of 20 bee species and 10 genera: Apis, Trigona, Eulaema, Centris, Euglossa, Scaptotrigona, Partamona, Megalopta, Rhinetula, and Oxytrigona was made in two forests in Panama. Two traps were operated simultaneously at canopy height and in the understory to test whether there were consistent stratum associations. Studies were continuous for 1 and 8 years. The only high-canopy foragers were two nocturnal bees, all the rest flew at both heights with similar probability or consistently came to lower traps. Large euglossines showed a tendency to forage high, which was directly related to their capacity for heat loss during flight, compared to smaller euglossines. They are also more conspicuous in warning coloration, another expected correlate of foraging more often in the open. Although large variance in stratum association predominates, some medium-sized diurnal forest bees avoid the exposed upper canopy, while some nocturnal bees tend to forage there. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Apis; bees; Centris; Euglossinae; Megalopta; Meliponinae; pollination; stratoorientation; stratum fidelity; tropical forest canopy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027135878

The selectable marker, used to follow pollen movement, was a dominant transgene (bar) conferring resistance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium. Transgenic and non-transgenic plants of the cultivar Westar were planted in a 1.1 ha field trial, with the transgenic plants in a 9 m diameter circle at the centre, surrounded by non-transgenic plants to a distance of at least 47 m in all directions. A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m2 areas. These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic plants. Seed samples were harvested from each of the 7 distances so that approximately 20% of the circumference of the plot was sampled at each distance. The centre non-transgenic circle was also sampled. Plants were grown from the seed samples and sprayed with glufosinate to estimate the frequency of pollen dispersal at each distance. In order to screen enough samples to detect low frequency cross-pollination events, seed samples were tested in the greenhouse and on a larger scale in the field. Results were confirmed by testing progeny for glufosinate resistance and by Southern blot analysis. The estimated percentage of pollen dispersal in the non-transgenic centre circle was 4.8%. The frequency was estimated to be 1.5% at a distance of 1 m and 0.4% at 3 m. The frequency decreased sharply to 0.02% at 12 m and was only 0.00033% at 47 m.

Pollinations to flower buds were used to reduce the inhibitory ability of the style and these crosses were compared with flower pollinations to assess the degree of stylar influence on pollen fertilization ability. There was less pollen tube attrition after bud pollinations than after flower pollinations, indicating that styles of buds were less able to inhibit pollen tubes. The variance component for plants acting as pollen donors tended to be greater after flower pollinations than after bud pollinations. The lower variance in male success after bud pollinations indicates that differences among pollen donors after flower pollinations were due to stylar inhibition of pollen rather than differences in pollen vigor. Since the level of variation in pollen growth after pollination to flowers was greater among clones than among ramets within clones, the differences in pollen fertilization ability are probably genetically based. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Bud pollinations; Male reproductive success; Petunia hybrida; Pollen-style interactions; Variance components,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027130397

An international trial (the Boron Probe Nursery) was conducted as a collaboration between Chiang Mai University, CIMMYT and National Agricultural Research Systems in various countries, to verify the B response in non-traditional, warm wheat-growing areas. There was a wide genotypic variation in reproductive responses to B among the eight wheat genotypes studied. In sand culture with low B (0.2 ?M), grain set index ranged from 9.5% in SW41 to 94.5% in Fang 60; with high B (10 ?M) it was ?90% in all genotypes. Early vegetative response to B was measured in the length of the youngest emerged blade at 12 days after sowing. Without added B the length of the leaf blade relative to that with 5 ?M B ranged from 0.82 to 0.92. This indicates some variation in vegetative response to B among the genotpes. However, there was no relationship between vegetative and reproductive responses to B of the wheat genotypes. Fertility of both the male and female part of the wheat flower appears to be affected by B deficiency. Ears from B deficient plants that were bagged to prevent cross fertilization set no grain. Cross pollination of B deficient female flowers with pollen from B sufficient plants resulted in only 28% grain set, compared with 94% percent from manual crossing of B sufficient pollen on B sufficient female.

The source of the dominant marker, the donor, was interplanted among recipient clones lacking the marker (recessive genotype), for which outcrossing was to be measured. Eight out of the 17 clones tested were advanced breeding clones which had wild species cytoplasm. Seven out of eight of these had outcrossing rates above 0.75, showing complete male sterility in one case and partial male sterility in six cases. Among the other clones tested, which were male-fertile, outcrossing estimates ranged from 0.10 to 0.74. Wide variability in outcrossing rate in autotetraploid potato suggests that it should be possible to select for higher outcrossing rate in production of open-pollinated true seed populations of potato for genetic or commercial purposes. © 1993 Springer.",cytoplasm; inbreeding; Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena; Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum; synthetics; true potato seed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027139458

The kinetics of pollen-tube growth demonstrated that P. nigra and P. alba pollen tubes have distinct behavioral patterns inside P. nigra pistils. P. alba pollen tubes exhibit an unique S-shaped growth curve and an arrested growth site near the sylodium. P. nigra pollen tubes exhibit two growth phases, in the stigmatic tissues and in the ovarian cavity respectively. P. nigra and P. alba curves diverge 5 h after controlled pollination and could be related to a change in the physiology of the P. nigra pollen tube, which shifts from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic type of nutrition. Protein analysis of pollinated stigmatic extracts (0,6 and 20 h after pollination) revealed qualitative and quantitative differences that are related to the presence of either P. nigra or P. alba pollen tubes inside the stigmatic tissues. Increasing numbers of protein bands were detectable from 0 to 20 h after pollination only in intraspecific cross. Glycoproteins were detected, and the differences observed were dependent of the cross. ?-Galactosidase activity was found in pollinated stigmas, but an increase in its activity (one isozyme of pHi 4.2) between 6 h and 20 h after pollination was detected only in the intraspecific cross. This enzyme could play a role in heterotrophic pollen-tube nitrition, and its activity could be the final result of a series of interactions started by the initial pollen-stigma dialog. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",?-galactosidase; Incongruity; Pollen-pistil interactions; Pollen-tube growth; Populus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027145872

Box 5677, Athens, 30613, GA, United States","The pattern of degeneration in mature synergids of pearl millet prior to pollination was examined by transmission electron microscopy after conventional and antimonate fixation to precipitate loosely sequestered calcium (Ca). The extent of degeneration and the distribution of Ca in a synergid varied among samples, and also between some sister synergids. However, there seemed to be no difference between sister synergids in the total amount of precipitates present in each cell. Characteristic signs of degeneration in the antimonatefixed synergids were: a gap above the filiform apparatus with fibrillar material, precipitates, and fusing or disintegrating membranes; increased precipitates in the nucleus, nucleolus, and endoplasmic reticulum; fusion or collapse of a few vacuoles in the chalazal core with precipitates and flocculent material deposited nearby. The numerous mitochondria and proplastids in the micropylar portion of the synergid remained intact and mostly free of precipitates. The shape and content of the chalazal vacuoles appeared to be disparate and dependent on the fixation procedure as well as the extent of degeneration within a synergid. The results suggest that the sister synergids of pearl millet undergo autonomous degeneration apparently in two independent sequences that may be spatially and temporally separated. The vacuoles appear to be dynamic organelles that store Ca in association with some other material. A high concentration of Ca may be localized along or between the common wall of the two filiform apparatuses. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperm fertilization; Chemotropism; Egg apparatus; Embryo sac; Filiform apparatus; Pollen tube,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027145871

The flower opens at any time of the day, and the anthers of outer stamens dehisce after about one day and those of the inner stamens after two days. The stigmata on the semicarpous (nearly apocarpous) pistil, which are already receptive when the flower opens, are situated in the center of the flower and move gradually outwards to touch the anthers of outer stamens about five days after anthesis. The breeding experiments show that the stigmata are receptive at least for five days, and many seeds are produced through autonomous self-pollination. That means the nearly apocarpous pistil, which is in a primitive condition, is adapted to the autonomous self-pollination. The selfing rate including insect-mediated self-pollination is very high, and this sexual-reproductive system seems favorable to the saprophytic plant which is probably severely limited in its resources. However, cross-pollination also may be performed by the small bees of Lasioglossum and some other insects, even though they do not so frequently visit the flowers and the out-crossing rate is low. © 1993 The Botanical Society of Japan.",Petrosavia sakuraij; Pollination; Protogyny; Saprophyte; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21344489487

Torsdag (Lh). In addition, plants homozygous for the lhi allele have reduced seed yield compared with Lh (tall, wild type) and lh (dwarf) plants. In this paper we show that the lhi mutation is expressed in developing seeds and pods. Comparison of GA levels in young shoots and developing seeds of genotypes lh and lhi demonstrates that the relative severity of the two mutations varies in different tissues. Homozygous hi seeds have reduced GA levels, weigh less, and are less likely to develop to maturity when compared with Lh seeds. However, fertilization of lhi plants with Lh pollen increases seed GA levels, seed weight and seed survival, indicating that an increase in seed GA levels due to the presence of the Lh allele can restore normal seed growth. Pods developing on self-pollinated lhi plants are shorter than pods on Lh (wild type) plants, although this may be an indirect effect of the increased seed abortion of lhi plants. Based on these results we suggest that endogenous GAs play an important role in the development of seeds of P. sativum L. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Gibberellin content; Mutant; Pisum (seed and pod development); Seed development; Zygotic selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000208849

However, no pollen grains were dispersed from the male flowers in the pollination season from February through April in this particular sugi specimen. The inside structures of the male flowers appeared to be quite different from the normal flowers under an scanning electrion microscope. We observed no mature pollen grains in the pollen sacs of the male flowers collected before and during the pollination season.

In field choice experiments, males strongly prefer to visit flowers that are very low in the habitat, 15 cm, vs. flowers that are placed at 55 or 105 cm.

Such pollen-tube hypertrophy (PTH) was examined under fluorescence using both light and confocal microscopy in order to characterize this anomalous pollen-tube behavior and to verify its occurrence within the embryo sac central cell. Three genetically unrelated L. esculentum cultivars ('Peto 95', 'Apex 1000', 'Nagcarlang') were utilized as the female parents in interspecific pollinations with L. peruvianum accession LA 1708, and seed set was obtained from all crosses. It was observed that PTH was not a rare event in these crosses, with the proportion of PTH ranging from 2.6% to 6.5% of all ovules examined. Self-pollinated controls revealed zero (e.g., 'Nagcarlang') to extremely low (<0.01%) frequencies ('Apex 1000' and 'Peto 95'). The differences in frequencies suggests that the specific genotypes of the parents has an affect on the occurrence of successful pollen-tube dissolution and sperm-nuclei transfer. Pollen-tube hypertrophy represents a poorly understood, though easily identified, form of fertilization failure occurring within the ovule. Its conspicuous nature, along with a relatively high frequency of occurrence in certain crossing combinations, should provide a valuable opportunity to better study the nature of such fertilization failures in angiosperms. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Incongruity; Porogamy; Syngamy; Unilateral cross-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-9844267479

Based on this and other studies, we hypothesized that interactions between the maternal cytoplasmic genomes and the paternal nuclear genome may cause alterations in genome structure and/or gene expression of a newly synthesized amphidiploid, which may play an important role in the evolution of natural amphidiploid species. To test this hypothesis, a series of synthetic amphidiploids, including all three analogs of the natural amphidiploids B. napus, B. juncea, and B. Carinata and their reciprocal forms, were developed. These synthetic amphidiploids were characterized for morphological traits, chromosome number, and RFLPs revealed by chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear DNA clones. The maternal transmission of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes was observed in all of the F1 hybrids examined except one hybrid plant derived from the B. rapa x B. oleracea combination, which showed a biparental transmission of organelles. However, the paternal chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were not observed in the F2 progeny. Nuclear genomes of synthetic amphidiploids had combined RFLP patterns of their parental species for all of the nuclear DNA clones examined. A variation in fertility was observed among self-pollinated progenies of single amphidiploids that had completely homozygous genome constitutions. Comparisons between natural and synthetic amphidiploids based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns indicated that natural amphidiploids are considerably more distant from the progenitor diploid species than the synthetic amphidiploids. The utility of these synthetic amphidiploids for investigating the evolution of amphidiploidy is discussed. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Amphidiploid; Brassica; cytoplasmic interaction; Evolution; Interspecific hybridization; Nuclear; RFLP,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000580412

The results obtained account for a wide array of types of pollen tube growth resulting from crossing partners with distinct incompatibility behavior. Based on the assumption that inhibition of pollen tubes is the rule and solely prevented by the pollen itself, a model proposing one common cause underlying different mechanisms for both intraspecific selfincompatibility and interspecific incompatibility in diploids is put forward. Data supporting the model are presented from the experimental results of this study and from the literature. The strength of pollen-style interaction depends on particular S-alleles in combination with recognition and activity properties of the basic S-genotypes. The model is suitable to explain all former observations on incompatibility in diploids with a gametophytic system of incompatibility and, with modifications of the manner of phenotypic expression, also in plants with sporophytic incompatibility. The proposed scheme of pollen tube growth phenotypes permits prediction of pollen tube growth behavior in an intended cross combination.

The exposed green carpels of snow-buttercup flowers have 1-2 stomata each. Net carbon assimilation rates of flowers are negative during bud expansion, but rise to zero at maturity, and become positive during early fruit growth. Experimental removal of separate whorls of flower parts demonstrated that the showy, nectary-housing petals account for most of the respiration cost of flower presentation. Conversely, photosynthesis by female organs contributes to a flower's carbon balance. Dipteran pollinators of R. adoneus are most active in sunny mid-morning to mid-afternoon intervals. At this time of day, rates of carpel photosynthesis (Amax) meet respiratory costs of pollinator attraction in fully expanded flowers. Achenes remain photosynthetically active until dispersal, and positive net carbon assimilation rates characterize infructescences throughout fruit maturation. Photosynthetic rates of achenes are positively correlated with infructescence growth rates. We tested the causal basis of this relationship by experimentally shading developing infructescences. Mature achenes from shaded infructescences were 16-18% smaller than those from unshaded controls. Leaf photosynthetic rates did not differ between plants bearing shaded and unshaded seed heads. Since female reproductive organs are only 8% more costly in terms of caloric investment than male ones and contribute to their own carbon balance, it is plausible that the energy cost of male function equals or exceeds that of female function in this hermaphroditic species. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Alpine plant; Cost of reproduction; Fruit photosynthesis; Ranunculus adoneus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001372140

It was assumed that pollinators concentrate on patches whose nectar rewards are relatively large compared to other patches and if pollinators visit a patch, they concentrate on the plants whose nectar rewards are relatively large compared to other plants in the patch. It was shown that plants are more likely to secrete nectar in populations where the total amount of resources allocated to flowers is large. It was also shown that strong interplant competition, strong interpatch competition and the nectar discrimination of the pollinators are also important factors for nectar secretion. However, if the total amount of resources allocated to flowers is sufficiently large, plants would secrete nectar even if competition is not very strong and nectar discrimination is not so precise. © 1993 Chapman & Hall.",flower size; game theoretic model; interpatch competition; interplant competition; nectar secretion; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027794173

The hort-term stress reduced plant water status to about -2·0 MPa over 16 d. The long-term stress was less severe, but was sustained for several weeks. Long-term water stress promoted the production of inflorescences. However, water stress also increased floret abortion and the premature death of whole flower heads. The number of ovules per floret was decreased by water stress.The most striking effect of both long- and short-term water deficit was to reduce pollen viability measured with the fluorochromatic assay. This was not an artefact of assay conditions. The pollen from water-stressed flower heads was not reversibly dehydrated; it did not score at similar viability to controls after incubation in conditions which hydrate pollen. In addition, the pollen from water-stressed plants lost viability more rapidly than pollen from well-watered plants after removal from the flower head.The consequences of reduced pollen viability on seed set were investigated by hand-crossing within and between groups of plants maintained for several weeks at three levels of water supply. Flower heads pollinated with pollen from water-stressed plants set fewer seeds per floret than those pollinated with control pollen. © 1993 Oxford University Press.",Floral characters; Seed set; Trifolium repens; Water stress; White clover,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010574944

Foraging and pollination efficiencies of the two bee species were studied comparatively. During the experimental period (10 days), the stingless bee foraged well and the nest weight did not change, though the honey bee often foraged inefficiently and the nest weight decreased by 2 kg. The average nectar volume of a flower was lower in the honey bee area (0.02 ?l) and nearly the same in the other two areas (0.1 ?l). We make a numerical model to describe pollination and fertilization process. This model shows that one visit of the honey bee pollinated 11% of achenes and one visit of the stingless bee did 4.7% on average and that 11 visits of the honey bee or 30 visits of the stingless bee are required per flower to attain normal berry (fertilization rate, 87%). In this study, the rate of deformed berries in the stingless bee area (73%) was lower than that of the control area (90%), but higher than that of the honey bee area (51%).

This paper addresses three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining the evolution of mast-seeding in temperate tree species, especially the genus Quercus: (1) mast-seeding is a consequence of mast-flowering which evolves to increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years; (2) mast-seeding has evolved as an anti-predator adaptation by which large seed crops during mast years satiate the seed predators and allow survival of some of the seeds; (3) selection on seed size by habitat can indirectly affect the evolution of masting if trees with large seeds require more time to accumulate reserves to mature those seeds. I find support for the pollination hypothesis in several wind-pollinated temperate tree species but not oaks. However, oaks show evidence favoring the predation and seed size hypotheses. I then develop a model to illustrate the relationships among the three hypotheses in their effects on the evolution of masting. Finally, using data from herbaria and Floras, the influence of selection via flowering, fruiting, and seed size in the evolution of masting in tropical oaks is discussed. I conclude that the need for a supra-annual cue to synchronize flowering and fruiting as well as the larger seed size found in many tropical oak species should contribute to the evolution of masting to a greater extent than seen among temperate oaks. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Acorn production; Mast-flowering; Mast-fruiting; Pollination efficiency; Predator-satiation hypothesis; Quercus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17744405106

Small populations produced no or only a few seeds per unit canopy area. Effects of population size on seed production per unit area and seed production per plant were present over the whole range of population sizes, indicating that even in large populations seed production may still not be at its maximum. Resource differences could not explain this disproportionate decrease in seed production with decline in population size, because there were no differences in soil properties and understorey or overstorey cover between the small and large populations. Although plants in small and large populations were similar in size, seed production per plant was much lower in small populations. This was not because plants in small populations produced fewer cones but because the fraction of these cones that was fertile was much lower. Five of the nine smallest populations (&lt;200 m2) produced no fertile cones over the last 10 years. The number of seeds per fertile cone did not depend on population size.

This high incidence of interspecific gene flow from crop to weed appears to be the result of asymmetric pollen flow to free-living plants from high-density cultivated populations. The observed level of crop/weed hybridization, combined with heterosis and partial fertility of F1 crop/weed hybrids, suggests that repeated annual cycles of C. quinoa cultivation within the North American range of C. berlandieri could produce introgressive change among sympatric wild populations.

Incorporation of radioactivity was linear for at least 4 hr. In terms of fresh weight, embryos about 20 days after pollination (DAP) were most active whilst activity expressed per embryo was high in the period 22-31 DAP, in agreement with the period of rapid accumulation of oil in vivo. Major labelled classes were diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs) and polar lipids (PLs).

Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) was the best-labelled PL at all times of rapid lipid synthesis. After 41 DAP, the amount of label in this phospholipid declined and there was increased radioactivity in lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPtdCho) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), possibly indicating increased turnover of PtdCho. The distribution of labelling within the fatty acids of individual lipid classes was studied and the results showed that the PLs contained significantly more [14C]palmitate and significantly less [14C]oleate than the TAGs for embryos at all stages of development. The data are discussed with regard to the possible influence of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT) activity in exerting significant flux control during periods of rapid TAG accumulation. © 1993.",Brassica napus; Cruciferae; developing seeds; lipid radiolabelling; oilseed rape; triacylglycerol formation.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001364894

In this paper we document that individual yucca moths, which are capable of acting as mutualists, facultatively ""cheat"" by ovipositing in yucca pistils without attempting to transfer pollen. Additionally, a high proportion of flowers are unlikely to receive pollen even when pollination is attempted, because many yucca moths carry little or no pollen. The probability of occurrence of non-mutualistic behaviour is not affected by the amount of pollen a moth carries: moths with full pollen loads are just as likely to act non-mutualistically as moths carrying little or no pollen. We propose four hypotheses that could explain facultative non-mutualistic behaviour in yucca moths. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Cheating; Mutualism; Pollination; Yucca moths; Yuccas,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027800157

The beetles were marked individually and tracked throughout their visits to Viburnum opulus L. (Caprifoliaceae), a partly beetle-pollinated shrub displaying large umbel-like, creamy-white blossoms. Beetle abundance differed greatly between study years. Of marked beetles observed on V. opulus flowers, an average of 26% returned each year. The beetles performed frequent inter-plant flights, and showed fidelity to particular V. opulus individuals at the study site. Furthermore, they preferred V. opulus to other plants flowering concomitantly and showed considerable constancy in this habit. Movements were mostly between individuals from unshaded locations with high inflorescence and flower number. Normally, the beetles flew on average about 4 times the horizontal nearest-neighbour distance between flowering V. opulus (c. 18 m). From these observations it is concluded that Cetonia beetles are powerful long-distance dispersal agents for V. opulus pollen, perhaps leading to an enhanced gene flow not possible with the plant's other pollinators. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Beetle pollination; Cetonia; Mass flowering; Movement patterns; Viburnum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027870082

In one of the apple crosses, both fruit and seed set decreased when a mixture of pollen and powder (diluted pollen treatment) was used for pollination. Also, seedlings from the undiluted treatment were more vigorous than those originating from pollination with diluted pollen. In the other apple cross, however, no effect on fruit set, seed set or growth in the first year was found. Mean diameter after the second year differed among treatments, but did not seem to be related to pollen density. For pear, the number of good seeds decreased and the number of deaf, probably unfertilized, seeds increased with decreasing pollen density. However, there was no apparent significant effect of pollen density on seedling growth. With respect to scab resistance and mildew attack in both apple crosses, no differences among treatments were found.

To interpret this observation, I suggest an explanation based on trade-offs occurring between the size and the number of flowers and fruits that mature when resources are limiting. I make this suggestion concrete with the aid of a phenotypic model analysed using the ESS approach. The model includes resource allocations to male and female reproductive structures at the time of flowering and to fruit maturation. The formulation allows for non-linear relations between opportunities for fertility gain on the one hand and flower and fruit size and number on the other. Results of the model indicate that fewer fruits will be matured than flowers produced, even in the absence of previously suggested factors such as pollinator limitation and bet-hedging in the face of environmental variability. Model results emphasize the distinction between flower versus inflorescence contributions to male and female reproductive success. Analysis also shows that the fruit to flower ratio in hermaphroditic plants will be lower than that in female plants, in accord with broad taxonomic surveys. Finally, results obtained lead to empirically testable predictions about the relationship between flower size, fruit size and the fruit to flower ratio. Methods to test these predictions are discussed. © 1993 Chapman & Hall.",ESS analysis; fruit to flower ratios; plant reproduction; sex allocation theory; size-number trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027828948

The first endosperm cell walls were in an anticlinal position relative to the cell wall of the embryo sac and originated from the cell plates and not from wall ingrowths from the embryo-sac wall itself. Alveolar endosperm was formed 3 days after pollination. Microtubules were associated with the freely growing wall ends of the anticlinal walls and were observed in various orientations that generally ranged from angles of 45 ° to 90 ° to the plane of the wall. They were absent in the regions where vesicles had already fused. These microtubules may function in maintaining the growth and the direction of growth of the anticlinal wall until cellularization is completed. At the site where three neighbouring alveoli share their freely growing wall ends, remarkable configurations of microtubules were observed: in each alveolus, microtubules ran predominantly parallel to the bisector of the angle formed by the common walls. These microtubules may form a physically stable framework and maintain the direction of growth of the wall edges. It is concluded that the growing edge of the anticlinal endosperm wall and its associated microtubules are a special continuum of the original phragmoplast that gave rise to the anticlinal wall. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Cell wall; Cytoskeleton; Endosperm cellularization; Microtubules; Ranunculus sceleratus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249163557

A male height advantage hypothesis has also been proposed, based on the supposed greater advantage of height to male reproductive success in wind-pollinated plants. These ideas were tested with data for wind-pollinated, monoecious trees and shrubs which exhibit a suitably large range of sizes. Number of male inflorescences increased faster with size than did number of female inflorescences in 2 of 9 species; in the remaining 7 species there was no significant difference. The male:female ratio of inflorescence numbers increased with height in 4 of 7 species and did not change significantly in the remaining 3 species, as shown by regression. Height and size are highly correlated and so their effects could not be distinguished. The fact that many conifers place the female cones uppermost in the crown suggests that size and not height favors increased allocation to male function, as does well-established theory connecting the existence of male versus female size advantage to pollen and seed dispersal chacteristics. Regression analysis of the relation between male and female reproductive effort should be done by reduced major axis regression; ordinary least squares regression underestimates slopes; in this study opposite conclusions could be drawn from ordinary least squares and reduced major axis regressions. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Alnus; Anemophily; Betula; Flowering; Gender allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027794518

In polyploid crops this condition of maximum heterozygosity has been reported to be associated with increased yield and optimum field performance. We report herein the first direct test of the maximum heterozygosity hypothesis. Molecular markers were used to examine the association between maximum heterozygosity and several components of yield in three different populations of tetraploid potatoes. The results indicate that the value of maximum heterozygosity is not universal but dependent on the genetic background of the material under evaluation. In a cross between adapted breeding lines, homozygosity was negatively correlated with tuber yield, and maximum heterozygosity was positively correlated with the proportion of tuber yield in the large-size fraction. In contrast, in crosses between adapted and unadapted parents, maximum heterozygosity had no detectable effect on any character. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the three populations reveals that, regardless of the genetic background, additive genetic effects are more strongly correlated with the components of yield than are any measures of heterozygosity and that some common QTLs may be influencing yield in all three populations. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Heterosis; Heterozygosity; Polyploids; Potato; RFLP,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000969874

Bills of female S. rufus are about 10.5% longer than bills of males, and this difference was associated with sexual differences in foraging abilities. Maximum extraction depths of female S. rufus were significantly greater than those of males, and no overlap between the sexes was observed. Moreover, handling times of females were shorter than handling times of males at flowers having longer corollas (?15 mm). Thus, because of their longer bills, female S. rufus have the potential to feed from longer flowers than males, and can do so more quickly. We suggest that no single mechanism is responsible for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in bill lengths of hummingbirds, but rather that the dimorphism probably reflects the combined effects of reproductive role division and intersexual food competition, and possibly, sexual selection. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Foraging behavior; Hummingbirds; Plant-pollinator interactions; Sexual dimorphism; Trochilidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027797598

The iso-electric focusing (IEF) patterns of the stigma/style proteins, were identical from day -5 to day +2. In pollinated flowers in vivo germination and pollen-tube growth in the ovary were affected by pistil age from day -2 to day +2. In addition, differences in sectorial filling in full seeds were observed within the fruits. A negative correlation was observed between the frequency of fertilized ovules in the pedoncular part of the fruit and ovary length at the time of pollination. In the whole fruit, significant differences in the number of full seeds and fruit size at maturity were found, and these were observed to be correlated with the various stages of female flower maturation at pollination. The day -2 and day +2 stages yielded the smallest fruits with few full seeds compared to the day -1, day 0 and day +1 stages, which had the biggest fruits and a large number of full seeds. A strong positive correlation was found between total seed number (including full and empty seeds), fruit length and weight at maturity.

Yucca elata and the prodoxid yucca moth Tegeticula yuccasella have a mutualistic association that is essential for the successful sexual reproduction of both species. However, a wide range of other invertebrate species visit flowers during the day and at night. Our aim was to quantify the role of yucca moths and other invertebrate visitors in pollination and fruit set, using manipulative field experiments. Inflorescences were bagged during the day or night (N=12 inflorescences) to restrict flower visitors to either nocturnal or diurnal groups. Yucca moths were active exclusively nocturnally during the flowering period and thus did not visit inflorescences that were unbagged during the day. None of the 4022 flowers exposed only to diurnal visitors set fruit, whereas 4.6% of the 4974 flowers exposed only to nocturnal visitors (including yucca moths) produced mature fruit. The proportion of flowers producing fruit in the latter treatment was not significantly different from unbagged control inflorescences. In a series of experimental manipulations we also determined that: (1) flowers opened at dusk and were open for two days on average, but were only receptive to pollen on the first night of opening; (2) pollen must be pushed down the stigmatic tube to affect pollination; and (3) most plants require out-cross pollination to produce fruit. The combination of these results strongly suggests that yucca moths are the only species affecting pollination in Y. elata, and that if another species was to affect pollination, it would be a rare event. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Fruit set; Mutualism; Pollination; Tegeticula yuccasella; Yucca elata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027882942

In orchid flowers, initiation of each of these processes in distinct floral organs is strictly and coordinately controlled by pollination, thus providing a unique opportunity to study the signals that coordinate interorgan postpollination development. Because ethylene has been implicated in contributing to regulation of several aspects of postpollination development, we focused on determining the expression of its biosynthetic genes and their possible role in regulation. The abundance of mRNA encoding both 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and ACC oxidase in the stigma, ovary, and labellum was found to be coordinately regulated by emasculation, auxin, and ethylene. Although petals contribute up to 26% of total flower ethylene and accumulate high levels of ACC oxidase mRNA and activity following pollination, no ACC synthase mRNA or activity was detected in this tissue. Together, these results support a model of interorgan regulation of postpollination development that depends on pollination-stimulated accumulation of mRNA encoding ethylene biosynthetic enzymes in a developmentally regulated and tissue-specific manner. This model relies on the translocation of a soluble hormone precursor, ACC, rather than on the translocation of the hormone itself. In this way, ACC serves to actuate the response already initiated by ethylene perceived by other parts of the flower. Thus, ACC may function as a secondary transmissible signal that coordinates postpollination development in diverse floral organs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027581891

To define the developmental signals and timing of critical events associated with ovule differentiation, we have examined factors that regulate the initial events in megasporogenesis and female gametophyte development and characterized its progression toward maturity and fertilization. Two days after pollination, ovary wall epidermal cells begin to elongate and form hair cells; this is the earliest visible morphological change, and it occurs at least 3 days prior to pollen germination, indicating that signals associated with pollination itself trigger these early events. The effects of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis on early morphological changes indicated that ethylene, in the presence of auxin, is required to initiate ovary development and, indirectly, subsequent ovule differentiation. Surprisingly, pollen germination and growth were also strongly inhibited by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis, indicating that male gametophyte development is also regulated by ethylene. Detailed characterization of the development of both the female and male gametophyte in pollinated orchid flowers indicated that pollen tubes entered the ovary and grew along the ovary wall for 10 to 35 days, at which time growth was arrested. Approximately 40 days after pollination, coincident with ovule differentiation as indicated by the presence of a single archesporial cell, the direction of pollen tube growth became redirected toward the ovule, suggesting a chemical signaling between the developing ovule and male gametophyte. Taken together, these results indicate that both auxin and ethylene contribute to the regulation of both ovary and ovule development and to the coordination of development of male and female gametophytes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000453478

Reproduction in this species is exclusively sexual and strictly xenogamous, with pollen transfer depending solely on insect vectors. Although flower morphology and phenology do not fully prevent self-pollination, and geitonogamy can easily take place, the level of autogamy was low at fruit initiation and fell later to zero due to abortion of self fruits. Thus, some self-incompatibility mechanism is operative in this species. Only 14% of the flowers initiated fruits, and 7.6% of these produced fully developed capsules. Fruit initiation was pollen-limited at the flower level. Causes of low fruit set could not be unequivocally established but probably include resource limitation. The seed/ovule ratio in fruits bearing viable seeds was 47%, which resulted in a brood size of 1.42. As many sterile fruits completed development as those bearing at least one viable seed. Pre-emergent (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) was 2.8%. Under near-optimal conditions, post-emergent success (percent viable seeds becoming reproductive individuals) was 24%. Overall fecundity was about 0.7%, representing (for 14-year-old individuals) between 120 and 4800 successful offspring per year. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Breeding system; Discaria; Reproductive success; Rhamnaceae; Seed dispersal; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027878374

Fruit/flower (Fr/Fl) ratio and seed/ovule (S/O) ratio varied markedly between populations. Although there were differences between years within the population studied over 3 years, these variations, although statistically signifcant, were less important than those between populations. Neither flowering phenology nor plant size influenced Fr/Fl or S/O ratios. Field experiments tested whether fruit and seed set were pollenor resource-limited. Hand-pollination had no effect on Fr/Fl or S/O ratios, but the reduction of resources by defoliation at the time of flowering decreased both relative components of fecundity. Manipulation of resources by hand-thinning flowers and tiny fruits had no demonstrable effect on these ratios, although brood size of individual fruits was significantly affected. It may be concluded that fruit maturation is resource-limited rather than pollen-limited. Most of the fruits aborted early in the fruiting season, and fruits with higher numbers of developing seeds had a lower probability of abortion than fruits with fewer seeds. Analyses of position effects revealed that the fruits in lower positions in the inflorescence matured preferentially. Furthermore, the two ovules in the same carpel tended either both to fail or both to develop into seeds. The plant's ability to selectively mature only high quality embryos may be limited. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Asphodelus albus; Brood size; Fruit/flower ratio; Position effect; Seed/ovule ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027884058

Male inflorescences are multiflowered whereas each female inflorescence is reduced to a single flower with persistent enlarged bracts. Pollination is a prerequisite for fruit and seed development and wind is unlikely to be an effective means of pollen spread. In southern Italy pollen is transported by small unspecialized flies and beetles. Both male and female flowers produce an indistinguishable sweet odour. Male flowers are produced in large numbers and over a larger period than the females and provide pollen, nectar, and staminal hairs as rewards for pollinators. The presence and function of staminal hairs with tip cells in Osyris alba has been reported for the first time. Female flowers are rewardless, producing neither mature pollen, nectar nor staminal hairs, but possess three modified yellow indehiscent anthers containing no viable pollen which may provide a strong visual feeding stimulus for pollinators. It is suggested that pollinators are attracted by deceit to female flowers by mimicry of the males and the floral mimicry is, therefore, intraspecific and intersexual. The floral characteristics and flowering phenology of male and female plants are consistent with this kind of mimicry. The female flower possesses a tricarpellary ovary with three ovules of which only one develops. The single seed, containing a small embryo and a large, rich endosperm, is borne in a red fleshy bird-dispersed fruit. The reduction in seed number per flower to one highly nutrient-invested seed, together with a reduction of the multiflowered inflorescence to a solitary flower and the sequential production of ripe fruits over an extended fruiting season, suggest that the female function is markedly resource-limited. It is suggested that, although all the reproductive characteristics present in Osyris alba, as well as hemiparasitism, had probably evolved before the end of the tropical Tertiary, they are of adaptive advantage in the nutrient and water-limited environment of the Mediterranean maquis. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",dioecy; floral mimicry; floral morphology; Mediterranean shrublands; Osyris alba; Phenology; pollination biology; Santalaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027144375

In SE Brazil, C. sciadostylis was visited by Eufriesea violaceae, and C. diploconos by Euglossa mandibularis; C. hartwegii was pollinated by Eulaema meriana in Costa Rica. The primary attractant, fragrant droplets that ooze from the dorsally bulged connectives, is mopped up by the males with the forebasitarsi.

Flowers of C. sciadostylis and C. diploconos undergo a colour change and an almost three-fold increase in corolla size when scent production and visits cease.

In transgenic Brassica plants that expressed the toxic gene fusion, flower morphology was normal except for aberrant papillar cell development and partial pollen sterility. Microscopic, biochemical, and functional analyses, mainly focused on papillar cell responses, revealed that papillar cells lost their ability to elongate, to synthesize cell-specific proteins, and to support pollen germination after self- or cross-pollination. This loss of stigma receptivity to pollination was mimicked by treating pistils with protein phosphatase inhibitors.

The populations were exclusively sexual and produced viable seed after spontaneous self-pollination, but showed large variation both in traits promoting cross-pollination and in autogamous fruit and seed set. Traits promoting cross-pollination, e.g., floral display, protogyny, and delayed selfing, were positively correlated, and these traits were negatively correlated with autogamous fruit and seed set. All diploid and many polyploid populations had high autogamous seed set and small, unscented, non-protogynous, and rapidly selfing flowers. In contrast, all populations with low autogamous seed set and large, scented, and strongly protogynous flowers with distinctly delayed selfing were polyploid. These results are consistent with those previously obtained from enzyme electrophoresis, suggesting that the genetically depauperate diploids are extreme inbreeders and that the highly fixed-heterozygous polyploids vary from extreme inbreeders to mixed maters. The reproductive data lend additional support to the hypothesis that allopolyploidy in arctic Draba serves as an escape from genetic depauperation caused by uniparental inbreeding at the diploid level. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Arctic-alpine plants; Brassicaceae; delayed selfing; Draba; fixed heterozygosity; inbreeding; mixed mating; Polyploidy; protogyny; reproductive biology; seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000929659

In addition to selection for yield, it is suggested that efficient breeding for higher yield requires simultaneous selection for yield's three major, genetically controlled physiological components. The following are needed: (1) a superior rate of biomass accumulation. (2) a superior rate of actual yield accumulation in order to acquire a high harvest index, and (3) a time to harvest maturity that is neither shorter nor longer than the duration of the growing season. That duration is provided by the environment, which is the fourth major determinant of yield. Simultaneous selection is required because genetically established interconnections among the three major physiological components cause: (a) a correlation between the harvest index and days to maturity that is usually negative; (b) a correlation between the harvest index and total biomass that is often negative, and (c) a correlation between biomass and days to maturity that is usually positive. All three physiological components and the correlations among them can be quantified by yield system analysis (YSA) of yield trials. An additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) statistical analysis can separate and quantify the genotype × environment interaction (G × E) effect on yield and on each physiological component that is caused by each genotype and by the different environment of each yield trial. The use of yield trials to select parents which have the highest rates of accumulation of both biomass and yield, in addition to selecting for the G × E that is specifically adapted to the site can accelerate advance toward the highest potential yield at each geographical site. Higher yield for many sites will raise average regional yield. Higher yield for multiple regions and continents will raise average yield on a world-wide basis. Genetic and physiological bases for lack of indirect selection for biomass from exclusive selection for yield are explained. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Culivar adaptation; Harvest index; Maturity; Partitioning; Photoperiod/temperature; Yield physiology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001824306

Since most differences between the flowers in both families are based on the functional differences in the pollination process, it seems that the question of common ancestry can best be solved by clarifying the problem of the evolution of the translator itself. Ontogenetic investigation has revealed that the central element of the periplocoid translator is the adhesive disc together with the base of the stipe. The translator in Secamoneae (the most primitive tribe in Asclepiadaceae) is homologous to this element, and in Secamone the adhesive disc is transformed into the corpusculum while the stipe is represented by the dorsal process to which the pollinia are attached. The translator in the genus Fockea represents an intermediate stage in the further phylogenetic elaboration of the asclepiad translator. It corresponds to Secamone in the development of a dorsal process for the attachment of the pollinia and in the special mode by which the corpusculum is attached to the anther wings. On the other hand, the elongated shape and the formation of a floor in the corpusculum are derived traits pointing to the more highly evolved Asclepiadaceae, such as the Asclepiadeae. The question of the derivation of the caudicles is discussed and a hypothesis concerning their development from pre-adaptive elements in Fockea is put forward. General conclusions are 1. that Periplocaceae and Asclepiadaceae are sister groups and that the common ancestor possessed a primitive translator composed of at least the two elements adhesive disc and stipe; 2. that the morphological difference of the translators between Periplocaceae and Secamone is smaller than between Secamone and the more advanced Asclepiadaceae. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Asclepiadaceae; floral evolution; Periplocaceae; translator ontogenesis; Translator ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002372228

In our investigations, we used homozygous male and female doubled haploid plants obtained from in vitro anther culture, the all-male F1 progeny and male individuals from subsequent backcrosses. The results showed that: (1) the character ""length of the style"" is genetically inherited and involves at least two genes, the influence of the environment being quite negligible; (2) in male pistils provided with style and stigmatic papillae, the pollination and growth of the pollen tubes up to the ovules do actually occur as a rule, the only barrier to fertilization being the absence of normal embryo sacs inside the ovules; (3) the character ""length of the style"" is a very reliable marker of the trend towards hermaphroditism in Asparagus, since a correlation always exist between length of the style, size of the ovary, tendency to self-pollination, vascularization and rate of development of the ovules inside the male ovaries.

What is the effect of hybridization on the pollination system, and conversely, what is the effect of the pollinators on the outcome of the hybridization? The original floral isolation is based on an interspecific differentiation in floral characters, the floral mechanisms of the parental species being specialized for pollination by different types of pollinators with different body forms and behavioral traits. F1 hybrids of A x B have intermediate floral characters and serve as bridges for interspecific cross-pollination. The problem next shifts to the changes in floral characters and mode of pollination that are likely to occur in later generations in the hybrid population. The pollinators of species A and species B exert selective pressures on the hybrid population. If the normal pollinator of A is more abundant, active, and effective in the hybrid population than the pollinator of B, selection is expected to favor a reversion toward the floral characters and pollination system of A. The opposite condition, in which the pollinator of B is predominant, leads to the reciprocal result, reversion toward B. If the two types of pollinators are more or less the same in number of flower visits and pollination effectiveness, their combined selective pressure should produce later- generation derivatives with intermediate floral characters suited for both pollinators. Three western North American plant groups containing florally isolated species that hybridize (Ipomopsis, Diplacus, and Aquilegia) are examined in relation to these predictions.

Oerst. and Wendlandiella sp. was studied from October 1988 to January 1990. Both palms are dioecious understory species that form locally dense populations. In C. pinnatifrons both sexes flower synchronously during the dry season. Prior to anthesis, the pendulous male inflorescence is inhabited by numerous thrips (Thysanoptera) and Ptiliidae (Coleoptera). Staminate flowers open by a small basal slit between the petals. At anthesis pollen is shed and the movements of the insects inside the flowers trigger pollen release in small clouds. Thus, the powdery pollen becomes airborne and finally air currents act as a vector, carrying pollen to the inconspicuous female plants, which usually are not visited by insects. The term 'insect induced wind pollination' is suggested for this pollination mode. Wendlandiella flowers during four months in the dry season. Male and female plants were not visited by insects. The dry condition of the pollen indicates that anemophily is the pollination mode in Wendlandiella. Fructification is rare but the plants show intense vegetative propagation. The significance of anemophily in the tropical lowland rain forest is discussed. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.",anemophily (wind pollination); Arecaceae (Palmae); Chamaedorea; insect-induced wind pollination; pollination biology; Wendlandiella,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250082482

Cattle consumed 98% of inflorescences, which were found to be highly nutritious. Reduced recruitment in flower-grazed populations could not be attributed to reduced flower survival, as recruitment in non-flower grazed populations was also reduced. Changes in population structure were due to cattle browsing small caudices, including both genets and ramets. An alternate hypothesis of limited germination in soils compacted by cattle was not supported. Cattle browsing of inflorescences reduced reproductive effort, which may be due to the inability of the plants to resorb nutrients after flowering. Browsing also increased branching, probably through lack of apical dominance, whereas physical trampling increased procumbency. Cattle browsing implies a lack of genetic recruitment, possible local extinction of the yucca moth Tegeticula yuccasella, the exclusive pollinator of Y. elata, and local reduction in insect and bird biodiversity. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Biodiversity; Cattle; Herbivory; Nutritional value of inflorescences; Yucca elata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027869394

(Liliaceae) in n semi?arid environment, to test whether seed production of plants was limited by quantity and/or quality of pollen supply. The natural pollinator are mainly solitary bees. The fraction pf flower setting MM varied from 8 to 40% between years. Fruit set of plants caged to exclude inserts was less than 3%. Fruit set was increased by artificial pollination of flowers with their own pollen to 43?64%, This indicates that the plant is self?compatible, but due to the position of the anthers and stigma, insect visits are required for effective pollination. Cross?pollinated caged flowers set yet more fruits (5982%) and much more (2?4 times) full seeds per fruit than self?pollinated flowers. The artificial addition of cross?pollen to flowers, in the natural environment, increased the moan number of full seeds per flower on the whole plant. Thus, natural reproduction was limited by insect pollination. A quantitative Biffed was indicated by a strong positive association between the number of pollen grains on a stigma and the probabilities of the flower maturing a fruit and of its ovules setting seeds. Furthermore, in 20?60% of [lowers in the population, stigma loads were less than 13 pollen grains, which indicated very low probability of fruit maturation. A qualitative response was shown by the positive effect of artificially added cross?pollen on the number of full vs. empty seeds, an effect similar to that of cross? vs. self?pollination in caged plants. The proportion of full seeds developing in a clone of Asphodelus in the natural population was inversely related to the proportion of inflorescences in its neighbourhood that belonged to the same clone, which suggests that fertility is limited by an excess of pollen from the same clone being supplied by insects. It is concluded that female reproductive success of Asphodelus aestivus in its natural environment depended on both the amount and origin of the pollen supplied by us pollinators.

Pollinator visitation rates to focal B. kaber plants declined sharply at low density in all backgrounds except the similar flower treatment. Widely spaced plants displayed significantly reduced seed-set in all backgrounds studied. The most dramatic density effects occurred where pollinators were induced to behave as generalists, suggesting that density-related declines in pollinator quality are more important than parallel declines in the quantity of visits. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027866161

Examination of the morphology of avocado flowers showed that the pistillate and stami-nate flower stages have similar structures. Bees collecting nectar, or nectar and pollen, visited both pistillate and staminate flowers, and due to the flower structure they were forced to touch both pistil and anthers. Only limited sites on a bees body contacted the anthers, and these collection sites also contacted the stigma, which occupied the same position as the anthers of the inner stamens. Most avocado pollen grains on bees visiting staminate flowers were clumped at the collection sites and constituted the main pollen available for pollination. Some pollen grains randomly distributed over the entire bodies of bees visiting either pistillate or staminate flowers could have been acquired inside the hive, and did not play an important role in pollination. The observations suggest that pollination within a cultivar is accomplished during the overlapping phase of its pistillate and staminate flowering, during which bees collecting nectar and pollen move freely among neighbouring staminate and pistillate flowers. Pollination between cultivars of opposite flowering type is carried out by bees moving between them throughout the overlapping period of pistillate flowering of one cultivar and staminate flowering of the other. Bees which collect only pollen usually do not visit pistillate flowers and do not contribute to pollination. © 1993 International Bee Research Association.",Apis mellifera; Avocado; Cross pollination; Flowering; Foraging; Honey bees; In-hive pollen transfer; Persea americana; Pollen; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027132804

Eastern spine?bills were recorded at all inflorescences monitored while visitation by other animals was more sporadic. Inflorescences were visited at least once every 24 h, and visitation frequency was approximately evenly distributed during the day and night. Examination of pollen tube growth from experimental treatments indicated that pollination success was similar from both nocturnal and diurnal visitors. However, nocturnal visitors were more effective at removing pollen from newly opened flowers. The behaviour of mammals at inflorescences was such that they would transfer much more pollen to flowers than other visitors, and probably contact receptive stigmas more often. Overall, mammals were considered to be slightly more effective pollinators than the more obvious daytime visitors, eastern spinebills. Although insects visited regularly, they were thought to be less effective at pollinating flowers than vertebrate visitors. Moths carried very little pollen, and the foraging behaviour of other insects was unlikely to promote much pollination. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Floral scent from 15 moth?pollinated species in nine families was collected by head?space adsorption. The chemical composition was determined by coupled gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC?MS). The typical floral scent of moth?pollinated flowers contains some acyclic terpene alcohols, their corresponding hydrocarbons, benzenoid alcohols and esters and small amounts of some nitrogen compounds. The floral scent composition of sphingophilous flowers can be distinguished from that of phalaenophilous flowers by the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The flowers of three of the studied species had the general appearance and floral scent composition of moth?pollinated flowers, but contained no nectar reward. These species probably rely on deceptive pollination by naive visitors, which are deceived by the similarity of the flowers' morphological and scent chemistry to that of rewarding moth flowers. The finding of similar or structurally closely related floral scent compounds in both temperate and tropical species from both the Old and New worlds suggests that floral scent composition has been selected by a specific group of pollinators, moths that have similar sensory preferences.

Mean natural fruit set in this population was <1%, whereas intermediate and high pollination intensity resulted in mean fruit set of 35 and 72%, respectively. In any given year, c98% of all flowering individuals fail to set fruit under natural conditions. Despite the dramatic increase in fruit set after hand-pollination, only plants in the high pollination intensity treatment showed a statistically significant reduction in future growth and flowering. A small seedling production per fruit would be enough to overcome the cost of fruiting; plants in the population should thus experience strong selection for increased pollination. This does not seem to explain nonautogamous orchids. Results suggest an alternative explanation: pollinator limitation could be evolutionarily stable if the correlation between fruit or seed production and seedling recruitment is sufficiently low. If an increase in fruit or seed production does not translate into an increase in fitness, then selection for increased pollination would not occur or would be too weak. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027524368

This bee showed no preference between the two Hedysarum species, but worker Bombus flavifrons, the most abundant visitor to H. alpinum, preferred to forage on H. alpinum. The exhibition of strong floral constancy by visitors to the two Hedysarum species suggests that interspecific pollination may not be strong enough to cause divergence in blooming times. There was no evidence that the presence of one Hedysarum species enhances visitation to the other. Because visition by worker B. flavifrons to H. alpinum was reduced on sympatric plots, H. alpinum may have to tolerate overlap with H. boreale to take advantage of worker B. flavifrons activity. The two Hedysarum species may simply bloom when their best pollinators are most active. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027838286

In contrast, the idea outlined by the author (that pollination not involving discriminating pollinators favors the evolution of female flowers) explains the associations simply in a terms of the removal of a selective barrier that is usually present. The realization that the presence or absence of necessary preconditions for some evolutionary change can determine the taxonomic and ecological distribution of certain characters is important when one attempts to give an evolutionary account of why some species evolve these characters while others do not. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027444109

Thermal constraints on flight acivity limit the pollinating effectiveness of bees. Each species of social bee has a microclimatic window within which foraging flight can be sustained. To predict whether a given species of social bee is worth testing as a pollinator in a given climate, it is useful to know at least the lower limits of that microclimatic window. We consider how information from a series of bee counts through a day can be used to characterize a bee species in terms of activity/microclimate relations as a basis for predicting the diel pattern of foraging activity of a bee introduced into a new climate as a pollinator. We discuss the relative merits of bee counts at a foraging patch and counts based on hive traffic as indices of the proportion of bees active. We suggest that the activity/microclimate relations of a species be expressed in terms of the lower threshold black globe temperature for flight activity. Black globe temperature, Tg, is easily measured with inexpensive equipment, and can substitute for measurements of ambient temperature and radiation as a predictor of diel patterns of bee activity. We use examples of field data to explore the relationship between microclimate and activity for the honeybee Apis mellifera and several species of bumblebee, Bombus. Regression analysis is used to relate activity to Tg and to identify the lower temperature threshold for activity from field bee counts. In field studies analysed here, the bumblebees Bombus terrestrisllucorum, B.pascuorum and B.hortorum began foraging at lower temperatures than honey?bees or B.lapidarius.

They flower from February-July. Both flowering time and nectar quantity are related to the species ability to tolerate intense water stress. Labiatae are visited by 201 insect species. Of these, 43 are exclusively supported by the family and 37 are monotropous. Solitary bees (mainly Anthophoridae, Megachilidae, Halictidae) constitute 47.3% of pollinators. The family is important in hosting specialized bees (15 species) in phrygana, particularly late in the flowering season. Labiatae species form two equally represented groups in this system: the late winter-early spring (early) flowering, visited by relatively few pollinator species, and the late spring-summer (late) flowering species, visited by numerous pollinators. This temporal distinction is accompanied by different pollination profiles that include duration of anthesis, reward to pollinators, floral attractiveness, and flower character differentiation. All of these attributes are maximized in the early flowering period. This strategy suggests a mechanism for resource partitioning at a time when the pollinator resource is limited and competition for the services of pollinators is intense. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027797503

The nectaries are dimorphic in the two sexes and pollen is loaded and unloaded as the bees gain access to the nectar. Both types of flower are open for only 6 h (from 0600 h to 1200 h); male flowers open and close half an hour earlier than female flowers. The latter produce more nectar and are visited more often by the bees than the male flowers. Pollen viability determined by fluorescein diacetate (fluorochromatic reaction) decreases by 20% during anthesis and more rapidly after the flower closes. This decrease is due to dehydration of the grain, especially around the pore where the intine is exposed.

Variation in scent chemistry of both Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha was considerable: different scent chemotypes were found among individuals as well as populations. Mainly linalool, lilac aldehydes and alcohols, geraniol, and methyl benzoate distinguished the chemotypes. Because of a high individual variation, floral scent in Platanthera is not suitable as a taxonomic tool. Scent variation can be the result of differential selection from various pollinators or pollinator groups. However, in a long?spurred race of P. bifolia the scent profile was not clearly different from that of short?spurred races in spite of their different pollinators. The two species form natural hybrids and part of the variation at the individual level may he explained by interspecific introgression.

This paper reports a test of this prediction in gynodioecious Phacelia linearis (Hydrophyllaceae), a species in which attractiveness to pollinators increases with corolla diameter. The relationship between corolla diameter and seed production was determined in three natural and three experimental populations. Phenotypic selection analysis was used, with lifetime seed production as a surrogate for fitness. Negative directional selection was expected on hermaphrodite corolla diameter. No directional selection (but possibly stabilizing selection) was expected on corolla diameter in females, which have smaller corollas than hermaphrodites. Shoot biomass and flowering time were included in selection analyses so that the effects of corolla size could be assessed independendy of these correlated characters. A parent?offspring study of the quantitative genetics of these characters also was performed. High seed production was associated with large shoot biomass (especially in natural populations) and early flowering (especially in experimental populations). The effect of hermaphrodite corolla size on seed production was not as predicted. Directional selection on hermaphrodite corolla diameter was generally positive. Directional selection on female corolla diameter was relatively weak and variable; stabilizing selection was found in one population. Most of the phenotypic selection on corolla diameter was caused by its (environmental) correlation with shoot biomass. Although these findings do not support the hypothesis that hermaphrodites trade off seed production to attract pollinators, a cautious interpretation is warranted. In one natural population, insect herbivory generated positive covariance between hermaphrodite corolla diameter and seed number, leading to a spurious estimate of positive directional selection for corolla diameter. Other, undetected sources of positive covariance between corolla size and seed production also might have obscured the expected tradeoff. Corolla diameter was found to be heritable, but shoot biomass and flowering time were not. The genetic correlation between hermaphrodite corolla diameter and female corolla diameter was positive and significant, but it was significantly less than 1, so corolla size could evolve independently in the two genders.

A phylogenetic analysis of seagrasses of the Cymodoceaceae shows the Cymodoceaceae to be monophyletic and Posidoniaceae to be their sister group. Information on the pollination ecologies and breeding systems of the various genera of the Cymodoceaceae were plotted onto the consensus tree obtained for the group. From this analysis, it is suggested that the clade composed of the Zosteraceae, Posidoniaceae and Cymodoceaceae evolved from a freshwater hydrophilous ancestor that developed submarine pollination and filiform pollen in association with invasion of the marine environment. Dioecism and surface pollination appear to have evolved in the progenitor of the Cymodoceaceae, and hence the seagrasses of the Cymodoceaceae are dioecious due to common descent rather than to convergent evolutionary processes in extant genera.

Small, unspecialized pollinators may be among the factors responsible for gender separation in this habitat. The underlying assumption is that poor fliers and/or communal foragers frequently effect selfing which in turn, given sufficiently severe inbreeding depression, should favor the establishment of dioecy. At least 10% of the genera of the angiosperms includes dioecious species; in tropical flowering plants, however, pollinators are reliably known only in a few species. Whereas temperate dioecious species commonly are wind- or water-pollinated, anemophily is less important in tropical forests, but occurs in at least 30 dioecious genera. Survey of tropical dioecious zoophilous species in 29 genera (21 families) for which pollination information is available shows that these species have specialized flowers adapted to specific pollinators rather than generalized flowers suitable for diverse insects. Known pollinators include solitary and eusocial bees, beetles, moths, flies, wasps (including fig wasps), and rarely bats and birds, and cover a wide range in animal size and locomotive capabilities. Floral rewards comprise pollen, nectar, stylar mucilage, nutritious tissues, brood-places, and resins. About a third of the species offer no reward in the female morph, pollination by deceit apparently being common.

We conclude that one cannot ascribe any local differentiation observed solely to restriction of gene flow unless one explicitly examines whether the degree of restriction is sufficiently severe to produce the differentiation. © 1993 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Animal-pollinated plant; Gene flow; Genetic structure; Pollen flow; Spatial structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009881729

Only c20% of the pollinator species occurred in all years of the research period. The very diverse, and shifting pollinator fauna is hypothesized to have brought the evolution of floral characters to a standstill. A peculiarity of the phryganic ecosystem is a preponderance of pollen as a floral reward and a relative scarcity of nectar. This may be an important factor in the high bee diversity that characterizes the phrygana and mediterranean ecosystems in general. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027838055

Short?tongued workers of B. terricola secured nectar by perforating the base of the corolla tube dorsally or ventrally and, in some cases, pollinated the flower while robbing nectar. The flowers are insect?dependent for pollination and are almost exclusively bumblebee?pollinated. Sugar concentration of nectar, determined by refractometry, ranged from 8.0% to 19.5% (mean = 13.9%), and fructose and sucrose components of nectar samples from North America and the Netherlands were detected by thin?layer chromatography. Excavated roots of Pedicularis palustris confirmed its root?hemiparasitism. Parallel pollination studies were carried out on Hypericum perforatum and Vicia cracca on the mainland in the same area which bloomed later than Pedicularis and were pollinated primarily by Bombus workers.

Biol. de Doñana, Apartado 1056, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain","This paper presents the results of a 5-yr field study on the determinants of individual variation in maternal fecundity (seed production) in the narrowly endemic violet Viola cazorlensis (Violaceae), at a southeastern Spanish locality. Flowers of this species are characterized by a very long, thin spur and broad morphological variability, and are pollinated by a single species of day-flying hawk moth (Macroglossum stellatarum; Lepidoptera, Sphingidae). The primary aim of this investigation was to answer the question, What are the relative importances, as explanations of individual differences in fecundity, of variability in floral traits and of other fecundity determinants that are of an extrinsic nature, such as microhabitat type and interactions with herbivores? The floral morphology of individual V. cazorlensis plants was characterized by means of both ""conventional,"" linear measurements of the size of flower parts (petals, spur, peduncle), and shape analysis of corolla outline (using thin-plate splines relative warps analysis). Spatial (among substrate types) and temporal (among years) patterns of variation in flower, fruit, and seed production by V. cazorlensis plants are described, with particular emphasis on the comparative effects of floral morphology, herbivory (by mammalian ungulates and two species of lepidopteran larvae), and substrate type (rock cliffs, bare rocks at ground level, and sandy soils), on cumulative seed production at the individual plant level. Cumulative seed production of individual V. cazorlensis plants depended significantly on average floral morphology (both size and shape components), thus revealing the existence of phenotypic selection on the floral morphology of this species at the study population. Among all the floral traits examined, spur length was the only one for which no significant relationship with fecundity was found. Type of substrate largely determined differences between V. cazorlensis plants in the impact of herbivory (plants growing on the soil exhibited the greatest reproductive losses to herbivores), and it also influenced plant size and flower production per reproductive episode. Plant size, in turn, influenced the supra-annual frequency of flowering and the number of flowers produced in each reproductive event. Flower production and herbivory levels significantly influenced (positively and negatively, respectively) fruit number, which was the major direct determinant of seed production. Path analysis revealed that the main determinants of individual variation in cumulative seed production over the study period were, in decreasing order of importance (absolute value of ""effect coefficient"" in parentheses), cumulative fruit production (0.946), mean flower production per reproductive event (0.868), plant size (0.441), herbivory by ungulates (-0.221), and average score on the first relative warp (0.107), a descriptor of flower shape. After accounting for the effects of substrate type, herbivory, plant size, and flower and fruit production, individual variation in floral morphology (aspects of size and shape) explained a negligible proportion (2.1%) of total individual variation in cumulative fruit production. Phenotypic selection on the floral morphology of V. cazorlensis at the study population, although statistically significant, was therefore almost inconsequential as a source of individual variation in maternal fitness, its effects being heavily ""diluted"" by the overwhelming influence of other factors. As exemplified by this study, selection on the floral phenotype may often become largely irrelevant in evolutionary terms because other ecological factors are far more important determinants of fitness differences among plants. A realistic assessment of the potential relevance of selection on plant reproductive traits thus requires a quantitative evaluation, in its natural scenario, of the predictable consequences of such selection.",Endemic plants; Fecundity determinants; Floral morphology; Flower shape; Herbivory; Monophily; Path analysis; Phenotypic selection; Pollination; Relative warp analysis; Seed production; Shape analysis; Sphingidae; Violaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027498835

Pollen is the sole reward to visiting insects except in the nectar-producing O. secunda and C. umbellata. Pollen:ovule ratios are very low, indicating efficient pollen transfer. Use of polyads may reduce the number of siring males. This trend may be counteracted by larger stigmas as in C. umbellata. Increasing pollen unit size may enhance relatedness of seeds, reduce abortion, and improve seed set. This may explain the evolution, within the Pyrolaceae and other families, of higher ovule numbers with larger pollen units. The plants are mainly pollinated by bumblebees. Chimaphila umbellata is visited by nectar-collectors; Moneses uniflora, Pyrola minor, P. rotundifolia and P. chlorantha are visited exclusively by pollen-buzzers; and Orthilia secunda is visited by both nectar-collectors and pollen-buzzers.

The effectiveness of staining methods using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-?-galactoside (X-Gal) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) to predict pollen viability was investigated. All of the staining methods gave variable results, but the TTC and X-Gal tests were particularly unreliable. FDA staining of pollen gave the best indication of its ability to germinate on the stigma and penetrate ovules. Pollen stored for up to three days at 25°C retained the ability to penetrate ovules following hand pollination, and of that stored for three years at 5°C, 19% of the grains fluoresced with FDA. Pollen stored at -18°C for 1 year retained the ability to penetrate ovules and produce pod set, and of that stored for 3 years, 23% of the grains fluoresced with FDA. Pollen stored at -196°C for one year retained the ability to penetrate ovules and produce pod set, but thawing and refreezing of the pollen reduced viability to zero. It was concluded that the most successful and convenient method of pollen storage was vaccuum drying followed by storage at -18°C.

Pollination biology was compared at Tarr Inlet on Baffin Island, Northwest Territories near the northern limit of the species, and Kuujjuaq, Quebec in the center of its distribution where sexual reproduction is the primary mode of reproduction. Plants at Tarr Inlet produced 15-30% of pollen produced at Kuujjuaq, both as a result of a lower density of staminate catkins and less pollen per catkin. Potential seed productivity is limited at the northern limit because pistillate catkins produce 50% fewer flowers in the north than in the south. While stigmatic pollen loads were similar at both sites, lower pollen viability (68% vs. 93%) and a higher probability of geitonogamous pollen due to clonal growth pattern reduced fertilization success at the northern site. Data suggest that lack of sexual reproduction at its northern limit is in part due to pollen limitation. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027708716

In contrast to former statements in the literature, the flowers of this famous plant are frequently visited by various insects in 29 familieS. However, in the two populations of L. Alpinum investigated here, flies (Muscidae) were the most frequent visitorS. Although the investigated insects carried pollen grains all over their bodies and qualify as mess and soil pollinators, pollen grains were not randomly distributed on the bodies of the insects but were most concentrated on their legs. Their loads of L. Alpinum pollen varied greatly, but more than 60% of all Leontopodium pollen grains found on the insects were carried by only 12% of the specimens collected, suggesting that a small fraction of the visitors is responsible for most of the pollen transfer. The number of pollen grains found on the insects also increased significantly with increasing body size of the insects. The scent of the flowers is sweet and honey?like (phenylethyl alcohol and phenylacetic acid) but also contains disagreeably smelling, sweat?like components (3?methyl?2?pentenoic acids, butyric acid and other fatty acids).Nectar is secreted in minute amounts in the tiny florets of the flower heads.

There were great differences among maternal genotypes in allowing foreign pollen to germinate on and penetrate into their stigmas, leading to a wide diversity of interspecific fertilization. The division of the hybrid primary endosperm nucleus and zygote appeared normal in all combinations of crosses. While the abundant free nuclei of the endosperm developed properly and never became cellular, the embryos degenerated as early as 10 days after pollination when the cultivar Rucabo, which had the highest fertilization record with species of B. juncea, was involved. When 81007 was used as female parent, the endosperm grew a little but the embryo halted at the heart-torpedo stage. Lack of nourishment might be responsible for the observed embryo abortion. Among the sic hybrid combinations, the cross 84014A x Changyang hunagjie was the only one where endosperm tissue was observable and an abnormal embryo occurred prior to cellular endosperm formation. Apart from the three typical embryological features, significant variation was also demonstrated among each of the cross combinations.

The species is gynodioecious with 55.4% of the plants being male?fertile and 44.6% presenting non?functional, shrunken anthers with no pollen, and behaving as functional females. Individual trees produced the same flower morph in four consecutive study years. Fruit set in bagged inflorescences was absent in male?sterile trees and was very reduced in male?fertiles. Open?pollinated flowers of male?fertiles showed greater fruit set (x?= 29.1%) than male?steriles (x?= 25.3%). Average fruit set in three experimental treatments (control, selfed, and crossed) were 29.05%, 41.9% and 38.6%, respectively, for male?fertile trees; those for male?steriles were 25.3%, 0% and 39.2%, respectively. Seeds from male?sterile plants were heavier (71.33 mg) than those of male?fertile plants (66.05 mg) but did not differ in germination ability. Male?fertile and male?sterile trees differ significantly in average nectar concentration (73.5% and 55.9%, respectively) and nectar volume secreted/flower and day (0.142 ?l and 0.171 ?l, respectively). A total of 41 species of insect flower visitors were recorded. Calliphorid and tachinid flies (41.97% of total visits), and andrenid bees (30.30%), were the most frequent visitors. The diversity of insect visitors was greater in male?fertile trees. Bees and flies accounted for 50.5% and 49.5%, respectively of total visits to male?fertile trees. Flies were far more frequent than bees at male?sterile flowers (76.9% and 23.1%, respectively). Male?sterile trees received higher average visitation (47 insects/census) than male?fertile trees (32 insects/census). Individual trees. showed a relative constancy of the fecundity rankings between years. Fruit production was significantly higher in male?sterile trees, with a four?year average of 6558 fruits, in contrast with male?fertile trees which yielded 4670 fruits. This 1.77?fold difference in favour of male?sterile trees over malefertiles was not compensated by the greater fruit set of the latter. This is attributable to the lower outcrossing rate of male?fertiles, estimated as 52.68% from seed mass data. In addition, greater seed mass of female progeny, and higher visitation rate by insects might explain the maintenance of this polymorphism. These results have far?reaching implications for the demography and seed?dispersal ecology of this endozoochorus species. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

The lower yield of m.s. plants was linked with a smaller number of fertile reproductive nodes. The efficient pollen flow was observed over the flowering period with both morphological and electrophoretic markers. Insect behaviour was not influenced by flower colour.

The plant hormone ethylene is known to play a key role in regulating the biochemical and anatomical changes that constitute the postpollination syndrome. For this reason, we have studied the pollination syndrome in Phalaenopsis orchids by examining the spatial and temporal location of ethylene biosynthesis within the orchid flower, and how this biosynthesis is regulated by factors that influence expression of genes that encode key enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. In particular, we examined the role in the postpollination syndrome of the expression of the gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of ACC to ethylene. In vivo incubation of tissues with the ethylene precursor ACC demonstrated that ACC oxidase activity increases after pollination in the stigma, contrary to the observation that activity is constitutive in petunia and carnation gynoecia. RNA blot hybridization of floral tissues indicates that the increase in ACC oxidase activity is due to de novo synthesis of mRNA and presumably protein, which is induced after pollination. Furthermore, the pattern of induction is consistent with a model of coordinate regulation of gene expression in which the pollination signal travels to other organs of the flower to induce their ethylene production. We have also used in situ hybridization to define further the temporal and spatial expression of ACC oxidase within the floral organs, showing that expression, and, by inference, the capability to oxidize ACC to ethylene, is induced in all living cells of the tissues examined after pollination. These findings contrast with work in petunia that suggests that ACC oxidase is localized to the stigmatic surface.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027666352

F121) induced to set by either pollination or auxin application. Before the onset of cell division, total polyamines were 50% higher in auxin?treated fruits than in pollinated ones, most of the polyamines being found as perchloric acid?soluble conjugates in both fruit set treatments. At the onset the level of polyamines in both fruit types was 100 times higher than during cell expansion or ripening. The highest polyamine found during cell division was perchloric acid?soluble conjugated spermidine in both fruit set treatments. After cell division, polyamine concentration was similar in both fruit set treatments. The concentration of polyamines in the jelly was similar in pollinated and auxin?induced fruits during cell expansion but not during ripening. At the onset of ripening there was an increase of one order of magnitude in the concentration of perchloric acid?insoluble bound putrescine in the jelly of pollinated fruits. Polyamines were more than 5?fold higher in unpollinated ovaries than in fruits induced to set by either pollination or auxins. It is suggested that pollinated and parthenocarpic fruits differ in their polyamine metabolism during the initial stages of development, but not after cell division. It is also suggested that polyamines undergo rapid turnover during cell division. Perchloric acid?insoluble bound putrescine might play a role in seed formation in tomatoes.

Euryglossa (Euhesma) morrisoni forages exclusively on V. nitens and E. (E.) aureophila forages exclusively on V. aurea. These bees carry much pollen on their bodies and appear solely responsible for seed set of 9-31% of ovules, with negligible seed set by V. nitens in the absence of E. morrisoni. Each anther of both Verticordia species releases pollen in copious amounts of oil (pollenkitt) beneath a hood-like appendage which terminates in a spout. Female bees ingest the pollen-oil mixture by touching the appendages with their glossae, and nectar by lapping the floor of the hypanthium. Most of the oils are isopentyl esters of the fatty acids, palmitic, stearic, arachidic (the major component of V. nitens) and behenic (the major component of V. aurea). These oils, as well as significant amounts of glucose, fructose and proline, are also present in the crop of E. morrisoni. The ability ofE. morrisoni and E. aureophila to remove and utilise pollen, oil and nectar from the flowers, their effectiveness as sole pollinators, and flower colour mimicry by E. morrisoni, together suggest an obligate mutualism between these bees and their Verticordia hosts. © 1993 CSIRO.

Inhibitor-treated flowers or floral buds were pollinated with untreated pollen and examined for pollen tube growth by fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that type 1 or type 2A serine/threonine phosphatases play a crucial role in the pollination responses of Brassica. We observed two distinct effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors on pollination: (a) the inhibition of pollen tube growth during cross-pollination in flowers, and (b) the breakdown of self-incompatibility or promotion of pollen tube growth during self-pollination in flower buds just prior to anthesis. Thus, treatment of flower pistils with protein phosphatase inhibitors resulted in the inhibition of pollen tube growth at the surface of the papillar cells of the stigma in crosses between different self-incompatible Brassica oleracea strains, in an interspecific cross between B. oleracea and Brassica campestris, and in self-pollinations of a self-fertile Brassica napus cultivar. With four different self-incompatibility genotypes, treatment of mature flowers with protein phosphatase inhibitors had no effect on self-pollination response. In contrast, treatment of flower buds just prior to the anthesis stage allowed self-pollen tube invasion of papillar cells. However, the magnitude of this effect was genotype dependent, being most pronounced in the S22 genotype. The data support the conclusion that pollinations in Brassica are controlled in part by the presence of phosphorylated proteins in the papular cells of the stigma, and that the quantity of these proteins or their levels of phosphorylation changes during stigma development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027143049

Long-level anthers dehisced early, lost an average of 39% of their pollen during their first visit, and did not consistently contact small pollinators, such as M. apicata. Short-level anthers restricted pollen removal more (28% lost) than long-level anthers, but dehisced more slowly and were subject to unpredictable pollen removal. Mid-level anthers combine the advantages of more exserted and inserted positions without suffering the corresponding disadvantages as they restricted removal (24% lost), dehisced relatively early, and seemed to consistently contact all pollinators. The overall benefits of positioning anthers within the perianth mouth, the position occupied by mid-level anthers in P. cordata, may explain the prevalence of this morphology among bee-pollinated plants with flaring, tubular, monomorphic flowers. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027380950

ECA and ODH were found to produce large numbers of seeds at the refuge, comparing favorably with closely related but non-endangered taxa. Extrinsic limits on seed production, such as the availability of effective pollinators, were found to important rather than intrinsic (i.e. genetic) limits. More than half of the ovules initiated by ODH during the two-year study period failed to become seeds. These ovules were contained by ovaries that failed to develop because effective pollinators (e.g. hawkmoths) were not available to carry pollen between flowers of different individuals in this outcrossing taxon. Management of the ODH population, therefore, will require special efforts to protect local populations of effective pollinators in order to minimize the pollination limitation in the future. Pollination and could also limit seed production in ECA, but only when the plant population was small and competition for pollinators from other species intense. Pre-dispersal insect predation was also more important when the ECA population was small. Management of the ECA population to maximize seed production, therefore, requires increasing population size by maximizing germination, seedling establishment, and growth in years of poor rainfall. Controlling competition from introduced annual grasses, particularly for moisture, is most important in this regard. The seed banks of ECA and ODH were large compared to the number of established plants, and exhibited typical seasonal patterns of depletion and replenishment. A minimum residual bank of viable ECA seeds remained during the entire year, suggesting there was overlap of generations and a buffer against catastrophic events that affect established plants. ODH, however, had a smaller residual bank and was, therefore, less well-buffered against the erosion of genetic variation and catastrophic events that affect the adult population. The long-term status and dynamics of the ECA and ODH seed banks will depend on management that reduces the seed density of introduced annual grasses in the refuge seed bank. © 1993.",California; endangered plants; predation; seed bank; seed production; seed/ovule ration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027451255

Large plants responded to reduced pollination by increasing flower production and the number of seeds per fruit; as a result, total seed production did not differ from that of large control plants. Small plants showed no change in response to reduced pollination, yet seed production did not differ significantly from that of controls, as seed production in both groups was low. Large hand-pollinated plants did not differ significantly from large control plants in any components of yield. Small hand-pollinated plants had significantly higher percentage fruit set and produced significantly more fruit and seeds than did small control plants. Differences in seed production reflected different proportions of plants that set some rather than no fruit. This may result from low pollinator visitation rates to small plants with small floral displays. Experimental results for large plants are only consistent with the hypothesis that large plants are simultaneously resource and pollen limited. To the extent that there is a trade-off between flower production and seed provisioning, large P. longifolia plants are allocating resources so as to maximize maternal seed production. In contrast, small plants are only pollen limited. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027528243

In both populations, 90% or more of self-pollinated plants produced seeds. Tableland plants were significantly more self-fertile than coastal plants (ratio of self seed set to cross seed set:tableland, 0.55 ± 0.03; coast, 0.08 ± 0.02). Significant variation among plants for self-fertility was found in both populations. Autofertility was 1.6% or less in both populations indicating that pollen vectors are necessary for seed set. Seed set by agamospermy in both populations was less than 0.1%. Percentage seed abortion was greater in self-pollinated plants than cross-pollinated plants in both populations. In both self- and cross-pollinated plants, seed abortion was twice as great in the coastal population than in the tableland population. No evidence was found for stigmatic or stylar self-incompatibility. Self and cross pollen adhered to and germinated equally well on stigmas in both populations (72 - 77% germination). Similarly, there were no differences between pollination treatments or populations in the percentage of ovules penetrated by pollen tubes (82 - 89% penetration). When self-pollination preceded cross-pollination by 24 h or longer seed set was significantly reduced compared to flowers that were cross-pollinated only, suggesting ovules were pre-empted by self pollen tubes. Collectively these results strongly suggest that self seed set was reduced by a mechanism operating at the ovule level, such as early-acting inbreeding depression due to recessive seed-aborting genes, although incomplete late-acting self-incompatibility cannot be ruled out. For coastal plants, this ovular mechanism largely prevents selfing, indicating plants were predominantly outcrossing although most produced some self seed. For tableland plants, substantial seed set by selfing may occur under natural conditions. © 1993 CSIRO. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027799809

Honey bees Apis mellifera foraged on one-dimensional arrays of mustard plants Brassica campestris. Individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance, and predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance. Models of pollen spatial dynamics based on individual pollinator behavior thus can be used to explore the consequences of plant spatial arrangement for gene flow in plant populations. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027510869

Fruit set was generally low (less than 5%), and equivalent for autogamy, self-pollination, outcross-pollination and inflorescences left exposed to natural pollination. Pollen tubes were produced in only a low proportion of flowers in the autogamy treatment, with few pollen tubes per flower and short pollen tubes in styles at both 24 and 48 h after anthesis. Selfing and cross-pollination produced equal numbers of pollen tubes in an equivalent and high proportion of flowers (ranging from 40% to 80%). However, pollen tubes resulting from selfing were shorter than from outcrossing after 24 and 48 h. Hand pollination experiments in which half of the flowers on inflorescences were pollinated with self pollen and the other half with outcross pollen generally produced a slightly skewed pattern of fruit set, with a higher proportion of the outcrossed flowers setting fruit. The following processes could contribute to the selective development of outcrossed fruit in this self-compatible species:(1) pollen tubes from outcrossed pollinations reach ovules before those growing from self pollen; (2) fruits that start to develop first obtain first call on limited resources; (3) fruits that are initiated later abort when other fruits on an inflorescence are developing. © 1993 CSIRO.

In general, sugar compositions of all hummingbird nectars were highly clustered toward the high-sucrose end of the composition spectrum. Significant correlations were detected between elevation and the percentage of fructose and of sucrose in the nectar (fructose percent positive, sucrose negative).

The series of fossil flower buds, floral fragments, and fruits are not identical to any modern genus of Ericales. Pollen grains were observed clumped on a stigma in one of the fossil flowers. Fossilized acid-resistant strands having characteristics in common with the muri connect pollen grains, and appear continuous with the tectum, supporting the interpretation that they are viscin threads. These are the oldest reported fossilized viscin threads, and the only fossilized viscin threads found in situ in flowers. In modern Ericales and Onagraceae, the presence of viscin threads is associated with highly specific plant-pollinator relationships, suggesting that such specific pollinator-plant relationships had developed by the mid-Cretaceous.

A cladistic analysis of the genus was performed using 16 characters from morphology, anatomy and embryology. Twenty of the 22 species were considered the terminal taxa. Polarity of the characters was based on the outgroup comparison method, using three alternative outgroups: the genus Fuchsia, Onagraceae excluding Ludwigia, and Epilobieae?Onagreae. Using Fuchsia as outgroup, 29 equally parsimonious cladograms were produced, each with 24 steps and a consistency index of 0.75. A successive weighting procedure was applied, resulting in 15 cladograms with consistency index of 0.85. The strict consensus cladogram defines eight monophyletic groups and supports most of the current sectional classification of Lopezia, with the exception that no synapomorphy defines section Jehlia. The larger sections Lopezia and Pelozia, although well?defined as clades, are not fully resolved internally. All cladograms support section Riesenbachia as monophyletic. The two alternative hypotheses for outgroups produced similar results: 61 most parsimonious trees, reduced after the successive weighting procedure to 15, which are identical to those produced with Fuchsia as outgroup.

Cally). petal senescence was associated with a climacteric pattern in ethylene production and an increase in ethylene sensitivity during the preclimacteric stage. The increase in ethylene sensitivity was caused by short?chain saturated fatty acids (C7 to C10) produced in the petals during the early stages of senescence. Pollination or application of octanoic acid to the styles of unpollinated flowers resulted in a sudden increase in ethylene sensitivity and a marked acceleration of senescence. Treatment with silver thiosulfate (STS) resulted in a suppression of ethylene sensitivity and a marked reduction in the levels of these fatty acids. However, even in STS?treated flowers pollination or treatment with octanoic acid gave rise to a drastic increase in ethylene sensitivity. Exposure of carnation flowers to 2. 5?norbornadicne (NBD) vapours resulted in a dramatic suppression of ethylene sensitivity which was also overridden by stylar application of octanoic acid. Exposure to NBD suppressed the increase in ethylene sensitivity caused by treatment with octanoic acid. It appears that short?chain saturated fatty acids increased ethylene sensitivity by increasing the ability of the tissue to bind ethylene. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

S-413, Sweden","Reproductive ecology (pollination biology, breeding systems, and reproductive effort and success) of the three Nordic species of Pinguicula, P. alpina, P. villosa, and P. vulgaris (Lentibulariaceae), was investigated in a subarctic?subalpine area at Abisko, N Swedish Lapland. Additional studies were carried out at Latnjajaure Field Station, a subarctic?alpine tundra site in the Abisko mountains (P. alpina, P. vulgaris), and in W Greenland (P. vulgaris). At Abisko the species are sympatric and large populations of all three were found within a 50 × 50 m area. The three species are reproduc?tively isolated by internal barriers by occupying different ploidy levels. Pinguicula alpina and P. vulgaris thrive in base?rich habitats, whereas P. villosa is restricted to nutrient?poor Sphagnum bogs, but habitat separation alone is probably not sufficient to prevent illegitimate pollen flow among the species. However, results showed that there are large and consistent differences in pollination biology, flowering phenology, and breeding systems, and these factors interact to create a highly efficient reproductive isolation at all levels, pre?zygotic as well as post?zygotic. Pinguicula alpina is an early?flowering outbreeder, P. vulgaris is an opportunistic late?flowering inbreeder, and P. villosa is quite intermediate between the two extremes. The phenology?based life history strategies of the Pinguicula species were in accordance with a general model developed for arctic flowering plants, predicting maximized fitness through pollen or seed in early? and late?flowering species, respectively.

Such behaviour has no simple evolutionary explanation. When inbreeding depression is low the theory predicts that self-pollination should be fixed. A residual crossing habit exists in practically all self- pollinated species that show low inbreeding depression. As recombination is useful to generate new genotypes it can be valuable when the environmental conditions are not stable. We used a simulation model to study the dynamics of adaptation with regard to different mixing mating systems. The evolution of a quantitative trait related to fitness has been related to the mating behaviour. In a first approach, all the individuals of a population outcrossed with the same proportion. The comparison between populations differing for their outcrossing rate, their effective size and their initial level of adaptation for new enironments, led us to the conclusion that the smaller the population and the lower its adaptation level, the more valuable outcrossing is. An optimum level of outcrossing has been found for each situation studied. In a second approach, selfing rate was controlled by a polymorphic additional locus. Thus, individuals with different outcrossing behaviours competed within each population. We found that a low level of outcrossing can be maintained and randomly fixed in such conditions, in spite of no inbreeding depression. The outcrossing rate that can be fixed when individuals with different mating behaviour compete is much lower than the optimum outcrossing rate found for the whole population. © 1993 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Directional selection; Evolution; Mixed mating system; Outcrossing rate; Selfing rate; Simulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027331758

Fruit-set varied between 6.6-8.3% (yearly averages) and was influenced by distance to nearest flowering conspecific patch. Isolated patches tended to have a low fruit-set. Size of patches was of minor importance for fruit-set and fruit-production, whereas intrapatch ramet density influenced fruit production positively via an effect on the proportion of ramets that flowered. A pollination experiment confirmed that R. saxatilis is self-incompatible. Within-patch pollinations indicated that isolated patches comprised single genets or incompatibility types. Between-patch pollination indicated that fruit-set may be pollen limited, at least some years. Deficiency of compatible pollen (or ""partners') is the most likely mechanism behind the distance-effect on fruit production found in the path analysis. A bagging experiment suggested that c50% of the fruits (drupelets) were removed by animals. The dynamics of the genet population of R. saxatilis in the study area was interpreted by a source-sink concept. Source populations represent local clusters of genets with high fruit production which enhances further local recruitment in source populations and provide the surrounding sink areas with propagules. Sink populations represent low-density populations comprising isolated genets suffering from partner-limited fruit production. These isolated genets may be loci for future colonization. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027802719

Experimental crosses and other tests were performed on a taxonomically diverse set of annual herbs, perennial herbs and woody species to detect genetic self?incompatibility, spontaneous selfing capacity and obligate agamospermy. The overall frequency of dioecy in the community is 9%.Dioecy is unequally represented among life?forms, increasing in frequency with greater longevity: 0% in annual herbs; 2% in perennial herbs; 17% in shrubs; 57% in trees. Thirty?eight percent of 37 hermaphrodite species proved to be genetically self?incompatible. Self?incompatibility, like dioecy, increases in frequency with longevity: 0% in annual herbs; 50% in perennial herbs; 80% in shrubs. The self?compatible species showed a wide range of breeding habits from facultative outcrossing to strong autogamy. However, in most self?compatible species hand self?pollination increased fruit and seed set over spontaneous selfing. Obligate agamospermy was not detected among hermaphrodite specieS. Absolute and relative fecundity were strongly correlated with the degree of compatibility. However, reduced fecundity in obligate outbreeding species could not be unequivocally attributed to pollinator limitation. For equivalent life?forms, the montane sclerophyllous forest exhibits proportionately more obligate outbreeding species than some tropical forests and other temperate communities. The strong tendency for obligate outcrossing in the Chilean community is seen as a result of interplay between life?history constraints and the intense abiotic and biotic pressures that are characteristic of the mediterranean?type climate community.

Zeatin, zeatin riboside, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Zeatin and zeatin riboside increased to maximal concentrations at an early stage (9 d after pollination [DAP]), corresponding to the stage when cell division rate was maximal. In contrast, IAA concentration was low at 9 DAP and abruptly increased from 9 to 11 DAP, thus creating a sharp decline in the cytokinin to auxin ratio. Coincident with the increase in IAA was an increase in DNA content per nucleus, attributed to postmitotic DNA replication via endoreduplication. Exogenous application of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 5 or 7 DAP hastened the time course of DNA accumulation per nucleus and increased the average nuclear diameter, whereas 2-(para-chlorophenoxy)isobutyric acid delayed such development. Exogenously applied 2,4-D hastened the accumulation of the zein polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 12, 14, and 16 kD and the expression of mRNA hybridizing with a zein DNA probe. We conclude that an abrupt increase in auxin induces cellular differentiation events in endosperm, including endoredupliction and expression of particular zein storage proteins.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000744940

We report here five members of a tobacco gene family (CELP, Cys- rich extensin-like protein) whose mRNAs are found predominantly in flowers and encode extensin-like Pro-rich proteins. CELP mRNAs accumulate most abundantly in vascular and epidermal tissues of floral organs. In the pistil, CELP mRNAs also accumulate in a thin layer of cells between the transmitting tissue and the cortex of the style and in a surface layer of cells of the placenta in the ovary. This unique accumulation pattern of CELP mRNAs in the pistil suggests a possible role in pollination and fertilization processes. CELP genes encode a class of plant extracellular matrix proteins that have several distinct structural features: a Pro-rich extensin-like domain with Xaa-Pro3-7 motifs and Xaa-Pro doublets, a Cys-rich region, and a highly charged C terminus. The extensin-like domains in these proteins differ significantly in their length and these differences appear to be results of both long and short deletions within the coding regions of their genes. Furthermore, the number of charged amino acid residues in the C-terminal region varies among the CELPs. These structural differences may contribute to functional versatility in the CELPs. On the other hand, the Cys-rich domain is highly conserved among CELPs and the positions of the Cys residues are conserved, suggesting that this region may have a common functional role. The presence of a Pro-rich domain and a Cys-rich domain in these CELPs is reminiscent of a class of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, solanaceous lectins, that are believed to be important in cell-cell recognition. The structure of these CELPs indicates that they may be multifunctional and that their genes may have arisen from recombinational events.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027248522

Male flowers have a higher nectar production rate but lower sugar concentration of nectar than female flowers. Flowers of both sexes were visited by pyralid moths at night and by calliphorid flies in the evening. Pollen was found attached on these insects visiting Nepenthes flowers.

Plants having self-incompatibility cannot achieve fertilization with the sperm of self-pollen, although they produce functional male and female organs. Self-incompatibility involves a recognition reaction between self and non-self in higher plants. in higher plants, recognition reactions are only known in the pollination system, involving self- and interspecific incompatibility, and in plantpathogen interactions. The homomorphic type of self-incompatibility includes sporophytic and gametophytic systems, which are defined by the action of S genes. in the sporophytic system, the behavior of pollen tubes is determined by the phenotype of the sporophyte, by which the pollen is produced. The self-incompatibility system is composed of three stages: (1) germination of the pollen grain, (2) ability of the pollen tube to penetrate the cuticle of the stigmatic papilla, and (3) interaction of substances secreted by the pollen tube with products of the stigmatic cytoplasm. A signal transduction system appears to be involved in sporophytic incompatibility, as SRK (S-receptor kinase) genes are found. Such genes have not been found to be involved in gametophytic incompatibility. © 1993, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027222828

This behaviour may result from perceptual limitations, the demands of energetic efficiency, or both. Perceptual limitations may be the product of underlying constraints on the processing of information by pollinators. Foraging simultaneously on several species can lower foraging efficiency through reduced ability to recognize the preferred species among others. This hypothesis was tested in laboratory experiments with bumble bees. Bumble bees learned to discriminate between one non-rewarding floral type and either one, two or three rewarding floral types that differed only in colour. Bees' learning rates were higher in experimental sessions with fewer numbers of rewarding floral types. The results suggest that when bees forage on an increasing number of floral types, their ability to discriminate between these and non-rewarding types is reduced considerably.

However, for wild plant populations there is little information on the amount of genetic variation for such traits. We estimated broad- and narrow-sense heritability of floral and reproductive traits for two populations of the perennial wildflower Penstemon centranthifolius, using a paternal half-sib crossing design in one case, and clonal propagation of ramets from different genets in the other. In both designs, most traits were significantly heritable, including nectar production, corolla length and width, inflorescence length and total flower production. Flowering date was significantly heritable for the crosses, but not for the clones, while nectar sugar concentration was not significantly heritable in either design.

Sinsk. (oil-seed rape or fodder rape), x Brassicoraphanus Sageret (Raparadish) and diploid (2x) and tetraploid (4x) accessions of Sinapis alba L.(white mustard). For the reciprocal intergeneric crosses between B. napus and x Brassicoraphanus no effective barriers to pollen tube growth on stigmata or in styles were observed. The resulting low frequency of hybrid plants was mainly associated with a low rate of ovules with micropylar penetration per siliqua or with embryo abortion. Hybrid plants could be obtained without use of embryo rescue. In reciprocal crosses between B. napus and S. alba 2x or 4x incongruity barriers were observed on the stigma, in the style, and in the ovary resulting in a low frequency of ovules with micropylar penetration per siliqua. Open flower-pollination compared to bud-pollination generally was the more favourable procedure for pollen grain germination and pollen tube growth in crosses involving S. alba, but for micropylar penetration and seed set no differences were observed. Crosses between S. alba 2x (?) and B.napus (?) were found to result in a higher frequency of ovules with micropylar penetration as compared to reciprocal crosses or crosses with S. alba 4x. All reciprocal crosses between B. napus and S. alba 2x or 4x were unsuccessful when no embryo rescue was applied. Embryo rescue shortly after pollination, i.e. 2 to 5 days, however, resulted in hybrid seeds and plants, but only when applied to crosses between S. alba 2x (?) and B. napus (?).

Nine different types have been identified in sixteen angiosperm families according to which organ is used for presentation, whether the pollen is exposed or concealed within a structure and how pollen is loaded onto the presenting surface:(1) Enveloping bloom presenters (Araceae); (2) Perianth presenters with exposed pollen presentation (Epacridaceae); (3) Androecial presenters (Santalaceae); (4) Terminal stylar presenters with passive pollen placement and concealed stigmas (Rubiaceae and Proteaceae); (5) Terminal stylar presenters with passive pollen placement and sub-terminal stigmas (Marantaceae and Polygalaceae); (6) Terminal stylar presenters with active pollen placement (Asteraceae, Calyceraceae and Lobeliaceae); (7) Sub-terminal stylar presenters (Campanulaceae, Cannaceae, Fabaceae and Myrtaceae); (8) Exposed stigmatic presenters (Rubiaceae); (9) Indusial stigmatic presenters (Goodeniaceae and Brunoniaceae). Secondary pollen presentation occurs in three monocotyledon and thirteen dicotyledon families. The presentation types appear to have been independently derived indicating that secondary pollen presentation is a character with a selective advantage. In all but the enveloping bloom type of secondary pollen presentation, developmental relocation of pollen requires simultaneous, introrse anther dehiscence and a close association of the presenting organ to the anthers prior to anthesis. The various secondary pollen presentation systems may be modified to promote xenogamy or autogamy and this can even change during anthesis. Most plants which have secondary pollen presentation, display reduced herkogamy within the flower to facilitate pollination. Increased risk of self-pollination due to this may be overcome through dichogamy, herkogamy within inflorescences, dry stigmas, self-incompatibility systems and passive or active control over pollinator behaviour. Enhanced male function of the flowers of secondary pollen presenting plants is also evident through extension of the male phase by the protection, controlled release and precise placement and receipt of pollen. Plants displaying secondary pollen presentation are almost always protandrous. © 1993 CSIRO. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027332350

As reference, the accumulation of zein proteins in endosperms grown to maturity in vivo under field conditions was also examined.

In vitro, the corresponding transcripts of the genes coding the 20 and 22 kDa zeins, and of the zein synthesis associated gene b-32, are also present. Under in vitro conditions, the level of expression of the zein synthesizing system, as monitored by zein accumulation, is dependent on the level and form of N supplied in the medium. In vivo, at stages of development from 19 DAP to maturity, the synthesis of the 22 kDa zein class and of the b-32 protein is under control of the O2 transcriptional activator.

In a constant nuclear background, the frequency of biparental plastid transmission is determined by the types of plastid genomes (plastomes) involved in the crosses. In this study, the impact of nuclear genomes on plastid inheritance was analyzed. In general, the transmission efficiency of each plastome correlated strongly with its compatibility with the nuclear genome of the progeny, suggesting that plastome-genome interactions can influence plastid transmission by affecting the efficiency of plastid multiplication after fertilization. Lower frequencies of plastid transmission from the paternal side were observed when the pollen had poor vigor due to an incompatible plastome-genome combination, indicating that plastome-genome interactions may also affect the input of plastids at fertilization. Parental traits that affect the process of fertilization can also have an impact on plastid transmission. Crosses using maternal parents with long styles or pollen with relatively low growth capacity resulted in reduced frequencies of paternal plastid transmission. These observations suggest that degeneration of pollen plastids may occur as the time interval between pollination and fertilization is lengthened.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027478369

Insects and other arthropods were sampled throughout 19891991 using pan trapping and sweep sampling of dominant plants. Assemblages of taxa were monitored as indicators of functional groups that influence ecosystem processes: pollinators, herbivores, predators, parasites, and detritivores. Relative abundances of indicator assemblages were compared between sites to evaluate the establishment and maintenance of processes critical for the natural function of the reconstructed riparian ecosystem. A major objective of this project was to create habitat for the Least Bell's Vireo, so a group of potential prey items was designated to indicate vireo food resources. Over 230,000 arthropods were identified to order or family and by size. Insect communities developed rapidly at the restored habitat. Although the abundance of all arthropods was lower at the reconstructed site than at the reference site, the same orders were present after three years in similar proportions at both locations, and mean abundances were within an order of magnitude of each other. Abundance of certain groups, such as detritivores, suggested that arthropods had propagated rapidly at the restoration site, a possible indication of resiliency. Relatively low numbers of other arthropods, such as predators and parasites, at the reconstructed site indicated the need for continued monitoring. The decline of pollinators and herbivores by 1991 at the reconstructed site suggested that they may have immigrated or been introduced with transplanted vegetation in 1989, but have had difficulty colonizing the site. Although the Least Bell's Vireos were seen foraging at the restored site after three years, no nests were found. Nesting is anticipated, however, as the site matures.

Grana were isolated and then vernalized for 4 to 8 weeks on Murashige and Skoog nutrients containing BAP (0.5 or 2 mg/dm3), NAA (0.5 or 2 mg/dm3), or GA3 (5 or 20 mg/dm3). Vernalized seedlings were cultivated in a greenhouse and the number of days to the heading of individual plants as well as the percentage of plants capable of generative development were estimated. The lower limit of size for 50 % survival of embryos strongly depended on the phytohormone used: from 0.9 mm in control, 1.1 mm in nutrient containing BAP, 1.2 mm for NAA, up to 1.7 mm in nutrient with GA3. Exogenous GA3 was lethal for embryos younger than 18 days but induced elongation of older embryos. Embryos isolated 2.5 to 4 weeks after pollination showed minimal requirements for the length of vernalization. BAP increased the percentage of heading plants originated from the youngest embryos. GA3 improved partial vernalization, strongly increasing the percentage of heading plants, but did not change the time from the end of vernalization to heading. It has been postulated that GA3 increases number of plants capable of overcoming the threshold of induction of generative development but does not accelerate the flowering process. Hormonized plants showed no deformation of generative development. As the effectiveness of vernalization increased, the heading of plants was faster but they were shorter, forming spikes with a smaller number of spikelets and producing fever lateral shoots. The very young embryos probably have in reserve sufficient amounts of auxins and gibberellins and therefore exogenous GA3 decreases their viability or even exerts a deleterious effect. However, as the embryos' ageing, gibberellin starvation develops. This being especially pronounced during vernalization. The de novo synthesis or activation of gibberellins takes place during the second stage of vernalization. This is why exogenous hormone improves the effectiveness of partial vernalization, though it is not possible to substitute by gibberellins the vernalization requirements of immature embryos.

Leuven, United States","Merrigan, T., K.U. Leuven, United States","The American Jesuit theologian, Avery Dulles, has written two major theological studiesof church and of revelationboth of which expressly employ and apply the insights of idel-theory to fundamental theological issues. This article aims to summarize and critically analyze Dulles theory of models, and to clarify it in the light of Dulles debt to two other thinkers in particular, namely, John Henry Newman (1801-1890) and Michael Polanyi (1891-1976), both of whom exercised a formative influence on Dulles thought. Dulles analysis of theological models can be presented in the form of a series of questions and answers, namely: 1) Why and whence models? 2) To what end models? 3) Which models? 4) How do we combine these models? 5) Who decides on the models? Dulles regards models as necessary because of the ultimately mysterious character of both the church and revelation. The whence question calls forth a more complex response. Initially Dulles appeared to see models as the natural outcome of imagery and metaphorical speech. Later he presented them as consciously and methodically developed theological constructions. Models can serve either an explanatory or an exploratory function. They are either devices allowing the synthesis of knowledge already available or the generators of new insights. The multiplicity of models is necessitated primarily in view of the complexity of the reality under consideration, though Dulles does reflect on the inherent limitations of all particular models. The determination of the authenticity of models is shaped by a large range of factors which make unanimity difficult. Models ought therefore to be allowed to coexist and to cross-pollinate one another, as it were. Where incompatibility emerges, one should strive to extract the positive elements from the conflicting views and to achieve some degree of harmonization. At any particular moment in the churchs life, it is ultimately the sensus fidelium which lends a model credibility and authority.

All the offspring families from the SS plant x F1 (SS plant x SF line) crosses demonstrated a 1SF?1SS segregation. The crosses of SS plants with some interline hybrids gave only self-fertile plants, whereas the crosses with other interline hybrids gave a segregation of 3SF:1SS expected in the case of digenic segregation. The data obtained permitted us to identify three different S loci (S1, S2, S5) and to estimate the genotypes of self-fertile lines for their Sf alleles: lines 5, 6, 7 and 8 are S1f/S1f S2n/S2n S5m/S5m, line 4 is S1n/S1n S2f/S2f S5m/S5m, and lines 2 and 3 are S1n/S1n S2m/S2m S5f/S5f(Sn, Sm designate active alleles of the incompatibility genes). The identification of the particular S gene which is presented by the Sf allele in each line has been made on the basis of our data concerning the linkage of the Sf mutation with isozyme markers of particular rye chromosomes, which is reported in an accompanying paper. © 1993, Springer-Verlag.

Fragrances were collected by passive diffusion on tenax adsorbent and analyzed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GUMS). The analysis was performed at six different levels: 1) by flower position on the same inflorescence; 2) by flower age on the same plant; 3) by position and age of the flower in the same plant; 4) by different shoots of the same plant; 5) by flowers from different plants; 6) and by plants from different populations. At no level of analyses were fragrances of sample pairs identical. The greatest similarity among fragrances was between flowers of the same plant. The most notable differences were between flowers of different populations.

We sampled seeds in different French populations and studied mitochondrial DNA, chloroplast DNA and life-cycle variability. Given the maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes and the nuclear determinism of the annual habit, we were able to determine the maternal origin and evolution of these weed beet populations. Our study shows that they carry the dominant allele B for annual habit at high frequency. The main cytoplasmic DNA type found in northern weed beet populations is the cytoplasmic male-sterile type characteristic of sugar beets. We were able to determine that these populations arise from seeds originating from the accidental pollinations of cultivated beets by adventitious beets in the seed production area, which have been transported to the regions where sugar beets are cultivated. These seeds are supposedly the origin of the weed forms and a frequently disturbed cultivated environment has selected for annual habit and early flowering genotypes.

The self-incompatibility reaction is associated with expression of stigma glycoproteins encoded by the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene. Only a few cases of self-compatible plants derived from self-incompatible lines in the crucifer Brassica have been reported. In these cases, self-compatibility was generally ascribed to the action of single genes unlinked to the S-locus. In contrast, we report here a line of Brassica oleracea var acephala with a self-compatible phenotype linked to the S-locus. By means of both biochemical and immunochemical analyses, we showed that this self-compatible (Sc) line nonetheless possesses stigmatic SLGs (SLG-Sc) that are expressed with a similar spatial and temporal pattern to that described for the SLGs of self-incompatible Brassica plants. Moreover, the SLG-Sc products segregate with the self-compatibility phenotype in F2 progeny, suggesting that changes at the S-locus may be responsible for the occurrence of the self-compatibility character. A cDNA clone encoding the SLG-Sc product was isolated, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed this glycoprotein to be highly homologous to the pollen recessive S2 allele glycoprotein. Hence, self-compatibility in this Brassica Sc line correlates with the expression of a pollen recessive-like S allele in the stigma.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027356102

A high level of H+-ATPase, restricted to the core of the L3 layer, was observed in early floral meristems. Later, a strong and transient induction of the enzyme was chronologically detected in anthers and in non-differentiated parenchyma cells from sepals. Temporal gradients of H+-ATPase expression were observed within the mesocarp layer of the ovary. The pattern of H+-ATPase expression was independent of the pollination of the pea ovary or its induced development by gibberellic acid. During their early stages of development, petals showed no detectable H+-ATPase and, indeed, its production was restricted mainly to differentiated tissues of vascular bundles, as observed in other fully differentiated organs of mature flowers. Parenchyma cells from both immature stipules and young leaves, also showed a high level of H+-ATPase expression during early stages of organ development. Although the existence of a basal expression of H+-ATPase in all plant cells cannot be excluded, the enzyme displayed a fine regulated pattern of expression supporting the view that, in tissues other than those specialized for transport, the enzyme may also be implicated temporally in processes of ion and nutrient uptake during cellular growth and differentiation. © 1993.",Flower development; Pisum sativum; Plasma membrane H+-ATPase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027143753

To quickly identify progeny expressing the transgene, embryos from T3 generation kernels were excised 20 days after pollination and exposed to different concentrations of hygromycin B. Surviving and non-surviving embryos were assayed for the presence of the hygromycin phosphotransferase (aphIV) gene using polymerase chain reaction. Embryos that germinated and survived on 25, 50, or 100 mg/liter hygromycin possessed the aphIV gene. Embryos that did not germinate lacked the gene. Progeny surviving selection were transferred to the greenhouse and tested for expression of the gene using a leaf disc assay. The results demonstrated that the gene construct was expressed in both embryo and leaf tissue and that selection during germination successfully eliminated progeny lacking the gene of interest.

Stapf is a small bush with a long flowering period in winter. Hundreds of small flowers open at one time. Its breeding system is highly self-incompatible, with an index of Self-Incompatibility of 0 - 0.1. The site of arrest of self-incompatible tubes is near the micropyle. In wild populations the natural seed set varies between 9 and 13%. Pollination is not a factor limiting seed set in these flowers since every stigma examined from wild populations carried some germinated pollen grains. The low level of seed production is because most pollinations are probably ineffective selfs which occur when pollen exudes from pores in the anthers directly over the stigma; air currents and rain splashing probably accentuate the effect. Self-pollination is facilitated by the long period of stigma receptivity which occurs for 12 days commencing 2 days after anthesis. Each flower contains approximately 60 000 pollen grains that are viable for up to 15 days. The pollen-ovule ratio is high, up to 32 000. Most pollen is shed 3 days after anthesis, but this depends on temperature, relative humidity and probably the water potential of flowers. The flowers are visited by few flying insects during most of the flowering season. In warm weather near the end of flowering a wide range of insects visit the flowers. Although the visitors are mostly small flies these are ineffective pollinators. The main potential pollinators are medium sized flies and bees. © 1993 CSIRO.

The nectary appears as swellings on the basal part of the ovary. The nectariferous cells are smaller and denser than the neighbouring parenchyma. Stomata are present in the nectary epidermis, but do not appear on the other parts of the ovary epidermis. Seven pepper breeding lines were grown near a bee yard in Rehovot. Five to six fold differences in nectar volume were found between the extreme genotypes. Nectar volumes were higher during noon and afternoon hours, as compared with morning hours. High correlation coefficients between nectar volume and sugar concentration were found. These were significant for the four high nectar yielding genotypes, ranging between r = 0.65 to r = 0.94. Male?fertile flowers produced more nectar and higher sugar concentration than sterile ones. Skewed distribution was observed in nectar volume of F2 populations, but relatively low heritability values were calculated. Pepper nectar contains fructose and glucose only. The former occupies 5282 % of the total sugar content. Pepper genotypes varied in frequency of honeybee visits and significant correlation between sugar quantity and number of honeybee visits per flower was evident. Fertile pepper flowers are not very attractive to honeybees and male?sterile flowers are even less so. The considerable variation in nectar characteristics can be exploited to increase attractiveness to honeybees, thus facilitating bee pollination in commercial production of F1hybrid seeds and improve fruit quality.

At the species level, the percent of polymorphic loci is equal to, or higher than, the average reported for all plant species. At the population level, however, hydrophilous taxa have lower percent of polymorphic loci, fewer alleles per locus, and lower levels of heterozygosity than non-hydrophiles. Except for Z. marina, hydrophilous species show much greater partitioning of variation among populations than non-hydrophiles, particularly when compared with anemophilous species.

Maternal plants raised in a greenhouse differed widely in their fertility following hand-pollination, ranging from plants that were effectively female sterile to individuals in which >80% of the ovules matured into seeds. This variation was largely genetic, as shown by a strong between-year consistency and a high clonal repeatability. There was a strong positive correlation between the seed-ovule ratio and pollen viability and proposed genetic load as the basis for fertility differences. Non-additive gene action combined with the great potential for clonal growth to maintain genotypes produced by sexual reproduction may be sufficient to explain the wide range of seed-ovule ratio observed. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027388601

An examination of flowering and fruiting phenology, breeding system and floral visitors revealed that low fruit-set in the population could not be explained by either a lack of pollinators or low levels of deposited pollen. Experimental removal of pods resulted in a near five-fold increase in fruit-set on subsequent flowers on treated plants compared with natural levels, indicating that fruit-set was resource limited. Low fruit-to-flower ratios do not detract from the colonising success of this species however, because individual plants flower prolifically year-round ensuring a constant production of propagules. © 1993 CSIRO.

Progenies of a number of seed?parents (families) were grown in a garden trial, and life?history and reproductive characteristics were recorded, in particular the rate of development from sowing, with synchronous germination, to first fruiting. Populations from botanic gardens were characterized by families exhibiting precocious reproduction, a finding which supports oru initial hypothesis. However, a degree of variation was detected in samples from all three botanic gardens ? Orford, Kew and Cambridge ? confirming the results of an earlier study of groundsel in the University Botanic Garden, Cambridge. In contrast, samples from maritime shingle beaches had a slower rate of development. There was no evidence of population variation, suggesting that genetic drift or founder effects might be important or that there may be selection for a narrow range of phenotypes, in such areas. Furthermore, at Shingle Street, Suffolk, there was evidence of sharp local differentation between plants from the single beach and from an arable field margin, 50m away, located behind sea defence. The characteristics of plants from other habitat types are discussed in relation to the apparent selection pressures imposed by different land use. Our results provide evidence of trade?offs in life?history evolution, e.g. the precocious variants were comparatively dwarf at first fruiting and shorter?lived. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Rather, for at least some weevil taxa, evolution appears to be mediated by one or more of a variety of strictly ecological factors, particularly habitat associations.

Fruits of the done Ofer bear fully developed seeds, whereas fruits of the clone BS1 contain only degenerated seeds and it was suspected that BS1 is parthenocarpic. The two clones differed in their pattern of fruit development. The increase in fruit fresh weight in Ofer was a result of both peel and pulp growth, whereas in BS1 fruit growth was mainly due to pulp growth and the peel had reached its final weight almost at anthesis. Pulp growth in BS1 commenced earlier and was faster than in Ofer, but the final pulp weight in BS1 was only 64% of that in Ofer. Seed growth in BS1 was limited to the development of semilignified and lignified seed coats, whereas in Ofer 43'5% of the seeds were completely developed, the remainder being similar to those found in BS1. Fruits bearing well-developed seeds were also found in a mutant of BS1 that, like Ofer, contained smaller ovules at anthesis than flowers of the regular BS1 genotype. Germination in vivo and in vitro were similar in BS1 and Ofer, but pollen tubes failed to reach the ovules in the regular BS1 genotype, while penetrating the ovules in Ofer and the small-ovuled genotype of BS1. Good-quality fruits similar to Ofer fruits in weight but with a higher peel to pulp ratio developed in BS1 after flower- sterilization in the spring and in the autumn. In Ofer, sterilized flowers failed to develop fruits in spring and partially set fruit in the autumn; the fruits consisted almost exclusively of peel tissue. It was concluded that BSÎ is a vegetative parthenocarpic clone, i.e., that pollination is not required for fruit set and development. © 1993 Annals of Botany Company.",Cactus pear; Fluorescence microscopy; Fruit development; Opuntia ficus-indica; Parthenocarpy; Pollen-tube-growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027130261

Roughly half the honey mesquites produce no nectar. There were no significant difference between morphs in pod production per raceme and compatibilities. Fruit set is significantly higher in open, cross-pollinated inflorescences. There is a high abortion rate in both naturally and hand-pollinated inforescences, regardless of nectar presence. The total daily numbers of the more abundant insect pollinators, Apis mellifera and Melissodes tristis, were the same when trees with and without nectar were aggregated, but were much higher in nectar producers when trees were in isolation. The number of pollinator species was also higher in nectar-producing trees, but although the number of pods per raceme was apparently higher in isolated, nectar-producing trees, differences between morphs were not significant. This result could be due to high costs of nectar in the plants that produce it, resource limitation, and/or because flowers need only one or few pollinator visits to set fruit.

Infection leads to sterility the following season when the infected plant produces fungal spores instead of pollen. Attraction of pollinators is thus associated not only with the cost of producing flowers but also with a risk of becoming infected by the fungus. The author analyses male lifetime reproductive success as a function of incidence of infection in a population, cost of flower production and attractiveness to pollinators (size of the inflorescence). Both lifetime reproductive success and optimal number of flowers are predicted to relate negatively to the incidence of infection in a population. This is a result of shortened reproductive liftime due to infection and a lower fertilization, as some pollen will be deposited on infected recipients. Lifetime reproductive success is further affected by the cost of producing flowers and the number of ovules in the recipient. Changing reproductive strategies in the population as a result of different incidences of infection, may in turn affect ovule number. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027492562

Analysis of the model, with the disease absent, revealed that the pollinators have a limiting effect on the growth rate of the population. The disease must possess a minimum transmission potential to be able to invade the host population. The condition was entirely dependent on the demographic processes of the host plant. The higher the recruitment rate of the host, the easier it is for the pathogen successfully to invade the host population. When the disease was able to invade the host population, disease incidence varied with the transmission potential of the fungal spores. If the disease incidence rose >50%, the host population was driven to local extinction, mainly because, at high disease incidence levels, the fraction of pollinators that carried pollen was almost non-existent.

Diese Untersuchungen wurden durchgeführt, um zu prüfen, ob neues oder gebrauchtes Holz und Styropor, die in Westkanada in großem Umfang zum Einsatz kommen, gemeinsam oder getrennt verwendet werden sollen. Es konnte ermittelt werden, daß neues und gebrauchtes Material getrennt verwendet werden soll. Weiterhin konnte festgestellt werden, daß die gewisse Reduktion der Zellenproduktion, die zu beobachten ist, wenn Styropor gemeinsam mit Holz verwendet wird, nicht so hoch ist wie bei der gleichzeitigen Verwendung von gebrauchtem und neuem Nestbaumaterial. 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343654596

Carpenter bees (Xylocopa californica arizonensis) in west Texas, U.S.A., gather pollen and rob nectar from flowers of ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens). When common, carpenter bees are an effective pollen vector for ocotillo. We examined ocotillo's importance as a food source for carpenter bees. The visitation rate of carpenter bees to ocotillo flowers in 1988 averaged 0.51 visits/flower/h and was 4 times greater than that of queen bumble bees (Bombus pennsylvanicus sonorus), the next most common visitor. Nectar was harvested thoroughly and pollen was removed from the majority of flowers. Hummingbird visits were rare. Pollen grains from larval food provisions were identified from sixteen carpenter bee nests. On average, 53% of pollen grains sampled were ocotillo, 39% were mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and 8% were Zygophyllaceae (Larrea tridentata or Guaiacum angustifolium). Carpenter bee brood size averaged 5.8 per nest. We measured the number of flowers, and production of pollen and nectar per flower by mature ocotillo plants, as well as the quantity of pollen and sugar in larval provisions. An average plant produced enough pollen and nectar sugar to support the growth of eight to thirteen bee larvae. Ocotillo thus has the potential to contribute significantly to population growth of one of its key pollinators. Although this carpenter bee species, like others, is a nectar parasite of many plant species, it appears to be engaged in a strong mutualism with a plant that serves as both a pollen and as a nectar source during carpenter bee breeding periods.

Experimentally induced failure of sexual reproduction increased allocation to asexual reproduction. Plants with inflorescence buds removed produced more (82 vs. 69) and larger 4.4 g vs. 3.8 g) tubers than those with unlimited sexual reproduction. Total biomass allocation to reproduction in plants receiving the bud-removal treatment was equivalent to combined allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in plants that produced flower heads and achenes. This suggests a complete diversion of resources from sexual to asexual reproduction when sexual reproduction is thwarted. Aboveground plant size did not change with treatment. Results suggest a flexible life history that can respond to sexual failure resulting from low pollinator availability or damage to inflorescences from hebrivory or weather, with enhanced facultative production of asexual tubers capable of sexual reproduction the following year. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027834845

Data are based on field trials in 1989 and 1990. All the combinations tested gave a very high relative heterosis on grain yield per ear, varying between 29.9% and 47.6% with an average of 42.1%. Even the higher parent was outyielded by 24.1% to 45.7%. This was the result of a heterosis effect on the two yield parameters grain number per ear and single grain weight. In the F2, heterosis for grain yield per ear was not significant with a range between 3.9% and 12.0%. F1 hybrids showed a heterosis effect on plant height but no hybrid was taller than the spelt parents. These data show that the gene pool of spelt could be potentially usefull for the selection of parents for hybrid production. For practical applications there remain several problems to be solved. Despite the very high heterosis effect the yield potential of spelt needs to be improved. No short spelt varieties exist at present to produce hybrids short enough for commercial application. Technical problems in the seed production arise because of the close tightness of the spelt glumes hampering either the pollination by the wheat parent or the pollen dispersal if used as a pollinator. However, a breeding effort to select for improved parents within the gene pool of spelt appears useful for future F1 hybrids between spelt and wheat. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",crosses; hybrids; spelt; Triticum aestivum; Triticum spelta; wheat; yield components,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027144612

Immature embryos were isolated for embryogenic tissue cultures that were maintained either on solidified medium or as liquid cultures. By transferring young somatic embryos to medium containing 90 mM sucrose and 7. 6 ?M ABA growth continued to mature embryos that accumulated storage reserves in both the hypocotyl?shoot axis and the cotyledons. Both zygotic and somatic embryos at different developmental stages were processed for microscopy as were the megagametophytes. Total protein was extracted from the seed material at intervals during development and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These analyses revealed that storage protein started to accumulate in the megagametophytes at the time when embryos were growing into the gametophytic tissue, while it occurred a few weeks later in the embryos at rapid embryo growth and organ differentiation. Lipid bodies also became abundant in the mature plant material. Although plastids with prominent starch grains were very frequent in both megagametophytes and embryos during development they were not observed in the desiccated tissues. Zygotic and somatic embryos displayed a similar developmental pattern. By sequential salt?extraction and dilution two fractions highly enriched in storage protein were obtained. One fraction (G?1), requiring higher salt concentration for protein solubilization, was dominated by a protein migrating to around M, 5500060000 when separated under non?reduced condition. After exposure to reducing agent this protein was replaced by two new ones with M, 33000 and 22000 giving evidence of disulfide bonded polypeptides.

These myrosinases are known to be encoded by at least two different families of myrosinase genes, denoted MA and MB. In the work described in this paper the presence of different myrosinase isoenzymes in embryos, seedlings, and vegetative mature tissues of B. napus was studied and related to the expression of myrosinase MA and MB genes in the same tissues to facilitate future functional studies of these enzymes. In developing seeds, myrosinases of 75, 73, 70, 68, 66, and 65 kD were present. During seedling development there was a turnover of the myrosinase pool such that in 5-d-old seedlings the 75-, 70-, 66-, and 65-kD myrosinases were present, with the 70- and 75-kD myrosinases predominating. In 21-d-old seedlings the same myrosinases were present, but the 66- and 65-kD myrosinase species were most abundant. At flowering the mature organs of the plant contained only a 72-kD myrosinase. MA genes were expressed only in developing seeds, whereas MB genes were most highly expressed in seeds, seedling cotyledons, young leaves, and to a lesser extent other organs of the mature plant. During embryogenesis of B. napus, myrosinase MA and MB gene transcripts started to accumulate approximately 20 d after pollination and reached their highest level approximately 15 d later. MB transcripts accumulated to about 3 times the amount of MA transcripts. In situ hybridization analysis of B. napus embryos showed that MA transcripts were present predominantly in myrosin cells in the axis, whereas MB genes were expressed in myrosin cells of the entire embryo. The embryo axis contained 75-, 70-, and 65-kD myrosinases, whereas the cotyledons contained mainly 70- and 65-kD myrosinases. Amino acid sequencing revealed the 75-kD myrosinase to be encoded by the MA gene family. The high degree of cell and tissue specificity of the expression of myrosinase genes suggests that studies of their transcription should provide interesting information concerning a complex type of gene regulation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027688678

Four hundred and forty?five triploid and tetraploid individuals, constituting the cross progeny of 2x?4x reciprocal crosses between diploids from nine distinct subspecies, and tetraploids from five subspecies, were tested for male fertility and phenology under homogeneous conditions. A significant negative correlation was observed between the parental genetic distance and the frequency of sterile panicles (ST) in 3x progeny, suggesting that selection may occur against fertility in triploid progeny from interploid crosses involving closely related subspecies. Genetic distance between the parental subspecies was not significantly correlated with the frequency of fertile panicles (FT), non?spreading panicles (NT, non?dehiscent anthers with pollen inside), and ST panicles in the 4x progeny, nor with the frequency of FT and NT panicles in the 3x progeny. Among the 4x progeny individuals that produced panicles, more than 60% were fully fertile, but 24% possessed only sterile panicles. In the triploids, 63% of the reproductive plants were male?sterile, but 31% had variable proportions of fertile panicles and 6% possessed only fertile panicles. Male fertility in the progeny was significantly affected by individual ploidy level, parental diploid subspecies identity, and by the interaction between these 2 factors in the case of the fertile progeny plants. The frequency of vegetative plants was higher in 4x progeny than in 3x progeny, more particularly when the seed parent was tetraploid. However, when the seed parent was diploid, the frequencies of vegetative plants were similar in 3x and 4x progeny. Pollen viability was significantly higher in anthers from fertile panicles than in anthers from non?spreading panicles; viability of pollen from non?spreading panicles was, in turn, significantly higher than in sterile panicles. Also, seed set was higher in panicles with fertile anthers than in the two other types. However, seeds from plants with fertile, non?spreading and sterile anthers showed no differences in germination rate. Therefore, in Dactylis glomerata, tetraploid cross progeny arising from 2n gametes possess higher fertility, on average, than triploid cross progeny involving normal gametes. In addition to lower male fertility (non?spreading or atrophied anthers), the triploids also showed significantly lower pollen fertility in anthers and lower seed set in open pollinating conditions, probably because disturbance in meiosis, due to odd chromosome associations, also occurs in eggs. Moreover, triploids were observed to reproduce preferentially with individuals possessing the same ploidy levels as their seed parent. These results suggest that the production of 4x individuals, derived from 2n gametes in interploid crosses, is likely to be the main effective means of direct gene transfer in contact areas of populations or subspecies possessing distinct ploidy levels.

One explanation for low fruit:flower ratios is that excess flowers allow plants to selectively abort inferior progeny thereby increasing the average quality of the seed crop. We examined whether self?pollinated fruits were aborted selectively in a partially self?compatible population of Banksia spinulosa. Inflorescences were divided in half and pollinated with cross pollen on both sides, self pollen on both sides or cross pollen on one side and self pollen on the other. Seed production was reduced significantly by 38% on fully self?pollinated compared to fully cross?pollinated inflorescences, indicating partial self?incompatibility or inbreeding depression. On inflorescences pollinated with both cross and self pollen, selfed seed set was reduced by 63% compared to crossed seed set. On the selfed half of these inflorescences, fewer fruits and seeds were produced, and more fruits had aborted seeds than on randomly selected halves of fully self?pollinated inflorescences. These results suggest that self?fertilized embryos were developed in the absence of outcrossed progeny but were selectively aborted when outcrossed progeny were present on inflorescences. To determine the amount of outcrossing occurring in the study population, outcrossing rates t of naturally pollinated plants were examined by electrophoretic assessment of progeny arrays. Values of I did not differ significantly from one, indicating complete outcrossing. High outcrossing, despite the high probability of self pollen receipt under natural conditions, is consistent with the conclusion that selective abortion occurs in B. spinulosa.

Treatments did result in a significant reduction in per branch flower production in the following year, especially on fruit-bearing branches in shaded sites and on artificially shaded branches. Defoliations at the level of the branch significantly reduced fruit maturation.

The effects of breeding system variation on several such attributes were examined in self-fertile tableland and outcrossing coastal populations of Blandfordia grandiflora R. Br. In general, overall flower size was similar in both populations, although pedicel and pistil stipe diameters were greater in coastal plants, and pistil length and stigma-anther separation were greater in tableland plants. Although all floral parts from coastal flowers weighed more, proportional biomass allocation to floral parts was similar in both populations. Daily nectar production per flower was similar in both populations. Tableland flowers produced more ovules but fewer pollen grains than did coastal flowers. Pollen-ovule ratios were 11 500 in coastal flowers and 5600 in tableland flowers. Open-pollinated tableland fruits produced more seeds than coastal fruits, but individual seeds weighed less; total seed biomass of tableland fruits was greater than coastal fruits. Prezygotic relative male biomass did not differ significantly between populations. Relative male biomass, estimated from stamen and seed weights, was 5% greater in coastal plants, although populations did not differ significantly. Similarly, relative biomass allocation to pollinator attraction (i.e. coralla and nectar) did not differ between populations. The onset and duration of stigmatic receptivity and pollen longevity of flowers from the two populations were similar. The large differences in ovule, seed and pollen production supports sex allocation theory which predicts that in self-fertile plants resource allocation should be female biased whereas in outcrossing plants, allocation should be male biased. The lack of differences between the Christmas bell populations in other aspects of floral morphology, allocation pattterns and biology suggests that changes in ovule and pollen production precedes changes in other traits during the evolution of autonomous selfing. Overall, these findings suggest that tableland plants may have evolved self-fertility only recently and selection has had insufficient time to change floral traits. Alternatively, self-fertility may not have evolved recently and floral traits promoting outcrossing have been maintained by selection, imposed by inbreeding depression and/or overdominance. © 1993 CSIRO.

Biochemical complementation occurs naturally when the mutant, flavonol-deficient pollen is crossed to wild-type, flavonoid-producing stigmas. We found that successful pollination depends on stigma maturity, indicating that flavonol aglycone accumulation may be developmentally regulated. Quantitative immunoblotting, in vitro and in vivo pollen germination, and high-performance liquid chromatographic analyses of stigma and anther extracts were used to determine the relationship between CHS levels and flavonol aglycone accumulation in developing petunia flowers.

Box 252, Applecross, 6153, W.A., Australia","Germination responses of species from the native plant communities of southwestern Western Australia can be related to syndromes of life history, fire response, and seed storage, and also to factors related to environmental stress. The Mediterranean-type climate of the region with periodic drought and recurrent fires affects the production of viable seeds in plants of limited stature and rooting depth. Fire response ephemerals and species cued to flower by fire tend to produce viable, readily germinable seeds, but there are instances where seed production is aborted in these predominantly herbaceous life forms. Clonal, rhizomatous species often produce mainly inviable seeds. Production of viable seeds in woody species of these highly diverse communities may also be restricted by limitations to cross pollination. Obligate post-fire seeding species tend to produce a greater proportion of viable seeds than species which are capable of resprouting following fire. Serotinous species, whether post-fire re-seeders or post-fire resprouting species, produce mainly viable seeds, which germinate readily once freed from protective fruits. Species of the legume families and a few others of the soil seed bank produce innately dormant seeds which can be germinated following heat shock treatments which simulate the effects of fire. Heat shock in these species appears mainly as a mechanism to crack the hard seed coats, but the effect of heat to denature seed coat inhibitors has not been eliminated. Western Australian species do not seem to break dormancy when exposed to leachates from burned wood as has been observed in comparable habitats in California and South Africa, but further research is advised. Germination in many native southwestern Australian species is cued by temperatures that correspond to the winter rainfall period. There are also indications that an after-ripening period of warm, dry storage increases percentage of germinable seeds. Stimulation of germination by hormones is almost unresearched in Western Australia, but germination percentages have been increased in a small number of species of horticultural potential. Stimulation of germination by soil nutrient concentrations is almost unresearched in Western Australia, except for the inhibitory effect of excess sodium chloride levels in Eucalyptus and Melaleuca. These species only germinate when osmotic effects are reduced to lower levels as would occur when winter rains dilute soil salts. Application of research on seed germination has already enhanced the establishment of seedlings in the restoration of mine sites and is becoming important in aspects of the breeding and selection of native plants for the cut flower, bedding plant and essential oil industries. © 1993 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027801802

Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC were identified using pooled sera from 15 skin and RAST positive patients. The IgE binding components in M.W. range of 14 to 70 kD were identified. The protein fractions of 70, 66, 64, 60, 50, 45, 36, 22 and 14 kD are the most prominent allergenic bands. Six samples collected during same pollination season from the same place showed similar allergenic profile. Of the samples collected from different stages of inflorescence, pollen of immature buds showed only three bands as compared to 18 from mature buds and flowers. Variability was seen in the IgE binding components of pollen stored for different years and obtained from different geographic regions of India. The IgE binding pattern of fifteen sera w ere heterogenous. The number of bands identified by different sera varied from 3 to 18. Two protein components of 66 and 36 kD were recognised by 14 (93.3%) of the 15 sera studied. The result suggests that there exists variations in the specific IgE binding pattern in pollen samples of Castor Bean, obtained from difference source materials. © 1993 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027138401

Each of the five natural populations (16 subpopulations), 5 seedlots of Chilean seed trees, 6 lots from Chilean seed orchards and 2 lots from seed orchards of other countries (a total of 29 subpopulations), were tested. There were significant differences among populations for volume, and among subpopulations within populations for the incidence of forking. There were no significant differences, either at the population or subpopulation level, for straightness or branch diameter. There were significant differences among trial locations for all traits. Among the mainland populations Monterey had marginally greater volume; the growth of the Guadalupe population was less and for Cedros significantly less than all other populations. The growth of the other three populations (Chilean orchards and seed trees, foreign orchards) were similar to each other and generally superior to the natural populations. Guadalupe had the highest proportion of straight trees. The relative rates of growth of the natural populations observed in this study were similar to results reported from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Due to the promising growth of some of the natural populations, it would appear possible to incorporate genetic material into the tree improvement programmes in Chile, after making controlled pollinations of the best individuals and selecting intensively among the progeny. © 1993 Taylor & Francis, Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345335922

Only mild strain was detected from pollen in the cultivars tested. True potato seed (TPS) were not doubly infected when they were obtained from co-infected maternal parent plants pollinated with pollen from healthy plants. Also, when maternal plants infected with severe strain were pollinated with pollen from healthy plants or from those infected with the mild strain, TPS were not doubly infected. A small number of TPS with double infection was obtained when co-infected or mild-strain-infected plants were pollinated with pollen containing the severe strain (singly or doubly infected). The number of TPS containing mild strain predominated in a ratio of 7:1 over TPS containing the severe strain. This study indicates that segregation of strains from doubly-infected plants probably takes place during pollen formation and persists through seed development. © 1993, Springer.

Four- and five-week-old fertilized ovules were isolated in the first cross and six-week-old embryos in the second. The ovules were cultured on six media which differed in their mineral salt and sucrose concentrations while the embryos were cultured on only one of these media and eventually cold treated for one month at 4° C before being placed in a culture room set at 23° C. The embryos that had been isolated in ovulo when they were still not visible under a binocular lens developed atypically. The embryos isolated in ovulo when they were heart-shaped and on average 0.27 mm long performed in ovulo germination on some media and/or enlargement on all of them after two weeks; after another two week culture, once isolated from the ovule, all of them germinated. The cultured isolated embryos, that were exposed to cold, enlarged and germinated more rapidly when placed at 23° C than those not exposed to cold. Furthermore, the plantlets resulting from untreated embryo germination were characterized by large cotyledons which were only partially green.

Calli exhibiting vigorous growth were selected, and upon transfer to regeneration medium gave rise to shoots. Four regenerated plants from three calli had morphological characteristics intermediate between those of the parents. The hybrid nature of these plants was confirmed by chromosome counts as well as isozyme and DNA analyses. They had amphidiploid chromosome numbers (2n = 32) and were fertile.

This transport of ABA through the head tissue was possible even during late embryogenesis. Changes, with embryo age, in [2-14C] ABA uptake by isolated embryos proved that the regulation of external ABA accumulation took place at the level of the embryo itself. During the first part of embryo development, an increasing intracellular pH of cotyledonary cells contributed to the increasing accumulation of unmetabolized ABA. Thereafter, an increasing catabolism played a major role in the decrease of ABA level. The importance of this catabolism and its particular orientation towards the formation of alkaline non-hydrolysable compounds presented the problem of the physiological significance of these conjugates. © 1993, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

The highest activities were observed in seed development during stages of rapid mitotic divisions: 10 to 12 d after pollination in the endosperm (216.1 units) and embryo (140.2 units). During stages of maturation, the endosperm HMGR activity decreases to one-fifth the maximal activity, and the embryo activity remains high at one-half the maximal activity. Both the endosperm and embryo HMGR activities decrease to a basal level (2.0 units) in the desiccated seed. At approximately 48 h after imbibition, the embryo HMGR activity significantly increases to 5.1 units.

The seed exhibited a normal 1:1 allelic recovery, and an excess of heterozygotes relative to Mendelian expectations that was significant at the GPI-2 locus (?2[1] = 58.0, P&lt;0.001). GPI-2 allozyme genotypes were also determined for the seed produced by an open-pollinated E. camaldulensis growing in a mixed clonal plantation. Most of the seed produced by this plant exhibited non-maternal alleles and was the result of cross-pollination. We conclude that post-zygotic seed selection was selectively eliminating genetic homozygotes from the selfed progeny and amplifying the frequency of cross-pollination products in the open-pollinated tree. We also found that the level of selection within fruits of the self pollinated tree was dependent upon the number of seeds and the number of ovules per capsule (P=0.019, r2=0.63 and P=0.008, r2=0.79 respectively using pooled classed data); selection intensities were found to be greater in fruits containing lower numbers of seeds or ovules. This may reflect the level of resources allocated to the fruit by a hormonally controlled positive feedback system.

Both percent fruit set and seeds per pollination were negatively associated with family zygotic inbreeding coefficients.

A continuous distribution of self fertility levels among the G65 x 'Ashworth' progeny provided little evidence for simple inheritance of this trait. Estimates of heritability were not significant and some evidence of specific combining ability was detected, indicating that parental self fertility was not predictive of the self fertility of the progeny in this study.

Energy-dispersive X-ray micro-analysis of reproductive tissues demonstrated that low levels of Al occurred in the stigma, lower style and unfertilised ovules of forest-site flowers. In contrast, significantly higher levels of Al were detected in all reproductive tissues of mine-site flowers. Al concentrations were higher at the base of the style than in the stigma. Al was also detected in stigmatic exudates of mine-site flowers.

However, the rate of pollen tube growth was not significantly different between mine- and forest-sites at any Al concentration.

The chromosome configuration at methaphase II also indicates that a certain level of stability has been attained cytogenetically. Although pollen stainability was relatively high, the seed set percentage was still low. Variation in morphological characteristics indicate the incorporation of one or more chromosome pairs from the C genome of B. oleracea. Other diagnostic characters such as the formation of determinate inflorescence, branching from the base of the stem, and the shift from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility must have resulted from the interaction between A and C genomes.

Abortion of pistillate flowers and fruit occurs generally in three distinct periods: due to under developed flowers, failure of pollination and embryo abortion due to embryological and physiological factors. Fruit set can be increased by hand pollination, use of growth hormones or by the application of fertilizers.

Three plasmids, each containing the selectable bar gene for resistance to the herbicide Basta and the ?-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, were delivered via particle bombardment, directly into immature embryos of two spring and one winter cultivar of wheat four days to two months after culture. Resistant calli were selected on phosphinothricin (PPT) media and screened for histochemical GUS activity. Twelve independent callus lines showing phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) activity were recovered from the bombardment of 544 explants (374 immature embryos and 170 one or two month old calli). R0 plants were regenerated from seven of these lines, of which so far five have produced R1 progeny, and two of the latter have produced R2 progeny. PAT activity was detected in each of the plants tested from the seven R0 lines, as well as in a 1:1 or 3:1 ratio in R1 plants following cross or self pollination, respectively. Resistance to topical application of Basta was seen in PAT positive plants and transgenic progeny. Molecular analysis by Southern hybridization showed the presence of the bar gene in all PAT positive R0 and R1 plants analyzed. Hybridization of the bar gene probe with high molecular weight DNA further confirmed integration into nuclear DNA. Both male and female transmission of the bar gene, and its segregation as a dominant Mendelian trait in R1 and R2 plants, were demonstrated.

Several open-pollinated seedling progenies of wild, diploid M. acuminata and M. balbisiana were also studied. Cryogenic preservation of leaf tissue in liquid nitrogen allowed sampling of a wide array of germplasm from Papua New Guinea and several Pacific Islands without transporting propagules which are subjected to quarantine regulations. Electrophoretic variation was recorded in three enzyme systems, MDH, PGI and PGM. In total, 52 distinct electromorphs were identified among 192 different isozyme phenotypes (zymotypes). Multivariate analyses of the data clearly differentiated the major genome groups and revealed patterns of association within groups. The isozyme data suggest that the genes contributed by the M. acuminata genome to the triploid Pacific plantain AAB subgroup are similar to those of the acuminata/banksii complex of Papua New Guinea.

To address this question, naturally shed pollen grains were transferred to stigmas of carpellate flowers of Zostera marina L. (eelgrass). These pollinated carpels were stained for callose, using aniline blue and examined under epifluorescence microscopy. Pollen germination, which occurred 2 h after pollination, first appeared as protuberances on the pollen (the so-called 'beaded pollen'). Once the tubes penetrated the stigma they grew straight through to the stylar canal and into the locule. At the funiculus of the uniovulate ovary, the pollen tube paths diverged and became disorganized as the tubes grew in many directions around the ovule towards the rear of the locule. Pollen tubes then grew towards the micropyle, and continued directly into the egg apparatus, where fluorescence was observed, indicating fertilization. © 1993.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027130059

The objectives of this study were to observe the cytology of female sterile ovules after pollination to determine possible reasons for sterility and a possible link to the aposporous apomictic developmental process. Cytological examination of 273 ovules revealed that they are small and deformed; 50% failed to form embryo sacs, and 35% formed multiple embryo sacs, which indicates the potential for apospory. Only 12% contained antipodal cells typical of sexual embryo sacs. In general, the embryo sacs occupied most of the ovule area limiting the amount of nucellar tissue available for endosperm and embryo development. Only six of the 273 ovaries observed had endosperm and/or proembryo development.

The rice programe has been so successful in increasing yields that some land could be diverted to other crops, thus increasing competition for scarce resources across commodities. The government is reexaminng its economic incentive structure for several important crops. Should the government promote rice as an export crop? Should it continue to subsidize inputs? Should it provide incentives to production of other crops that may have comparative advantage? To address these policy questions, this report examines trends in government policies and production of five major food crops - rice, corn, soybeans, sugar, and cassava; analyzes the effects of government input-output pricing policies on domestic production incentives for these food crops; and assesses their relative comparative advantage under three trade regimes: import substitution, interregional trade, and export promotion. Indonesian rice has comparative advantage as an import substitute but not as an export crop because of poor quality and a thin world rice market. Corn is the most efficient of the five crops as an import substitute, however. If corn productivity continues to improve with the adoption of pest-resistant, open-pollinated or hybrid varieties, it could become competitive as an export crop. Soybean production, despite rapid expansion, is not efficient because modern technology has not been adapted to Indonesia's agroclimatic conditions. Sugar is also economically inefficient. Without a quota system, it is likely that there would be a significant shift of land planted away from sugar. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027747488

PCR primers for the 35S promoter and for two regions of the coding sequence of the DHFR gene were used for amplification of the foreign sequence present in maize genomic DNA. The PCR products were hybridized with a mouse DHFR gene specific probe. Synthesis of the mouse DHFR in MTX resistant maize tissues was detected by staining for enzyme activity after native PAGE. The in vitro regenerated plants could be grown up to maturity in the greenhouse. Cross pollination has resulted in seeds and the F1 progenies were also analyzed.

Japanese cedar pollen is one of the most common antigens of nasal allergy in Japan, and the cedar pollinosis has recently been increasing from year to year. As the first step in the treatment of cedar pollinos i s, we attempted several forecasts such as the beginning date of the season of cedar pollinosis, the amounts of pollen grains, the number of days with a pollen count over 100 grains, the number of pollen grains on the days with the highest count of airborne pollen, the duration of the pollination season, and daily airborne pollen counts. In Fukui prefecture, pollinosis season begins when the sum of the maximum daily temperatures after January 1 reaches 300 degrees. Furthermore, the date the season begins depends on the mean temperature after the middle of December. The total pollen count is affected by the meteorolo gic condition of the previous summer, such as temperature and humidity. Moreover, biological condition of the cedar and factors which may affect the growth of cedar buds are important for a more correct forecast. The accuracy of daily airborne pollen counts predicted by the original criteria was 76.4% in 1991 and 84.6% in 1992. © 1993, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

Law et al. (1978) proposed a tall?dwarf hypothesis for wheat, in which the positive effects of minor height genes could be exploited by selecting for them in a major dwarfing gene background. The applicability of this hypothesis to pearl millet was tested by crossing a set of dwarf S1 progenies (from a single population) which varied in height onto two male?sterile lines. Mean (by S1 pollinator) hybrid grain yield was closely related to mean hybrid height (r2= 0.60) over a range of mean yields of 3.03.9 t ha?1 and a range of mean heights of 126165 cm. The effect of height was expressed as an increase in grain number in one cross and as an increase in grain mass in the other, indicating the importance of background genetic effects on yield?height relationships in dwarf hybrids.

Pollination of a pistil with pollen bearing an S-allele recognition factor identical to that expressed in the host plant stigma or style results in rejection of the self-pollen. Most of the studies on the molecular genetics of self-incompatibility that are summarized in this review have had as their goal the identification and characterization of the gene product(s) associated with the self-incompatibility response. These studies have provided a great deal of new and important information about self-incompatibility  despite the fact that many critical questions remain unresolved. Taken together, the present evidence from these studies indicates that the self-incompatibility response is likely to be far more complex than suggested by historical models. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We used this information to describe patterns of occurrence of dichogamy and to test specific hypotheses relating dichogamy to other characteristics of plants or their environments. Protandry was more common than protogyny at the intrafloral level, but the reverse was true at the interfloral level. Patterns of dichogamy varied significantly among major taxa, with protogyny more common among monocotyledons and primitive dicotyledons, and protandry expecially common in the Asteridae. Arctic species tended to be less dichogamous and more protogynous than temperate and tropical species. Aquatic and alpine species were especially protogynous. Patterns of dichogamy varied among sexual systems, with gynomonoecious and gynodioecious species especially protandrous, and monoecious species highly protogynous. Autogamous and self-compatible species were disproportionately protogynous. Flowers of intraflorally dichogamous species were slightly larger than those of adichogamous species, owing to the presence of many autogamous species in the latter group. Species with interfloral protogyny bore much smaller flowers than did species with interfloral protandry. Early-blooming species in north-temperate and polar regions were disproportionately protogynous. Sexual structures that abscised, shriveled or moved after completion of their function tended to be presented first, and those that facilitated the other sexual function were presented second. A negative association existed between type of intrafloral and interfloral dichogamy in diclinous species. Most animal-pollinated flowers were protandrous, except beetle-pollinated and refuge and trap blossoms. Wind pollination was markedly associated with protogyny. Vertical inflorescences visited by upwardly-moving vectors were protandrous. Our results suggest that three primary factors may be involved in promoting dichogamy: selection for avoidance of pollen-pistil interference, selection for avoidance of self-fertilization, and selection for synchrony of pollen discharge and stigma receptivity in the different flower types of diclinous species. In contrast to many earlier workers we reject the thesis that avoidance of self-fertilization is the universal or even the most important force in the evolution of most forms of dichogamy. We attribute the prevalence of intrafloral protandry to selection for avoiding interference between pollen export and pollen receipt. Intrafloral protogyny was associated with imprecise pollen transfer, where other means of avoiding pollen-pistil interference (e.g., herkogamy) are likely to be of limited value. The prevalence of interfloral protogyny seems to reflect the smaller size of unisexual flowers than bisexual flowers, the absence of intrafloral pollen-pistil interference in diclinous species, and selection for synchrony of pollen discharge from one flower type with stigma receptivity in the other. © 1993, The New York Botanical Garden.

The cytoplasmic differences were studied for several agronomic traits using mean values and general combining effects (gca) of male-sterile lines, and specific combining ability effects of hybrids. The fertility/ sterility behaviour of different male-sterile lines in crosses with common male parents was also studied. Significant differences among near-isonuclear polycytoplasmic lines were observed in mean values for a few traits such as plant height, leaf length and peduncle length, but the differences for combining ability were more pronounced. The A3 cytoplasm was a better general combiner than the A2 cytoplasm for grain yield and both A2 and A3 cytoplasms were better general combiners for leaf length and peduncle length. In addition, superiority of A3 cytoplasm for gca was observed for plant height and ear characters over the A2 cytoplasm in set II. A differential behaviour of cytoplasms, both in combination with a common pollinator and across pollinators, was observed for several traits. The results provide evidence for the distinctiveness of different cytoplasmic sources in pearl millet and for the influence of cytoplasmic factors on the phenotypic expression of nuclear genes.

Cutting the leaves causes wear to the bee's mandibular teeth and could reduce the bee's pollination efficiency and, ultimately, seed production. A method is described for employing digital image analysis to measure mandibular tooth areas for alfalfa leafcutter bees. The method is relatively quick and has high precision and repeatability. This method was used to measure the area of the mandibular teeth for leafcutter bees, before and after foraging in alfalfa seed fields, to evaluate differences in mandibular wear. Analysis of mandibles showed that foraging leafcutter bees collected in late July had significantly smaller tooth areas than pre-foraging bees collected prior to release in June. © 1993, Entomological Society of Canada.

Seeds are primarily dispersed by gravity and secondarily dispersed by small mammals. Mean primary and secondary dispersal distances for seeds were small (0.78 m and 2.35 m, respectively). A. mexicanum is beetle-pollinated. Estimates of pollen dispersal were similar, with a mean of approximately 20 m. The genetic neighborhood area (A) was estimated to be 2551 m2. To obtain the effective population size, three different overlapping generation methods were used to estimate an effective density with demographic data from six permanent plots. The effective density ranged from 0.040-0.351 individuals per m2. The product of effective density and neighborhood area yields a direct estimate of the neighborhood effective population size (Nb). Nb ranged from 102-895 individuals. Indirect estimates of population size and migration rate (Nm) were obtained using Fst for five different allozymic loci for both adults and seeds. The authors obtained a range of Nm from 1.2-19.7 in adults and 4.0-82.6 for seeds. Gene dispersal distances, neighborhood size and effective population size in A. mexicanum are relatively high, suggesting that natural selection, rather than genetic drift, may play a dominant role in patterning the genetic variation in this tropical palm. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027383561

Whether these ancestors were from the Plumerioideae, Cerberoideae or Apocynoideae has long been in dispute. This investigation is a comparative study of the pollen morphology and floral structure of selected genera of Apocynaceae and Periplocaceae. The examinded genera of the Plumerioideae and the Cerberoideae have 3-colporate, smooth to sculptured pollen grains. In the Apocynoideae there are single, smooth, 2-3-porate pollen grains or 3-to multiporate grains loosely united in tetrads of variable size and shape. The exine consists of an outer thick, homogeneous stratum subtended by a very thin, granular-fibrillar stratum, and globules; the internal septa are double-layered due to partial fusion of the tecta of the individual grains. The genera of Periplocaceae have pollen grains united in elongated, rhomboidal to rounded, or tetrahedral and decussate tetrads with few to many pores, pairwise, opposite or irregularly arranged. The exine consists of a homogeneous outer stratum and a thin granular stratum below. The internal walls (septa) are relatively thin, and perforate. Hemidesmus has an aggregation (massula) of elongated tetrads with indistinct pores. The exine is divided into a compact outer stratum and an inner, fairly thick, granular stratum. The inner walls (septa) are thin, granular, and non-perforated. Trends in floral structure center around increasing precision of the pollination mechanism for transport of pollen en masse. In the Apocynaceae this is mainly effected by the androceum and gynoecium. In the Periplocaceae the corona is also incorporated. Porate tetrads are correlated to a large extent with the advent of translators. Style-head secretions evolve from foamy adhesive for the transport of single pollen grains in the Apocynaceae to firm translators transporting pollen tetrads in the Periplocaceae and in Forsteronia, Apocynum, Poacynum and Trachomitum. The latter three genera are so similar in all respects that recognition of more than one genus seems unjustified. With special reference to pollen morphology a possible trend of evolution is postulated from taxa with single, 3-colporate grains to 3-porate grains and from taxa with pollen united in tetrads with compact inner walls as in the Apocynoideae, to taxa of the Periplocaceae with tetrads perforated septa and to taxa with pollen (tetrads) in masses. The Periplocaceae appear unrelated to the Plumerioideae and the Cerberoideae. The similarity between tetrads of Apocynum s.I. and Periplocaceae is here regarded as parallel evolution within two closely related lineages. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

P. pandorana is protogynous whereas anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity occur at the same time in P. jasminoides and P. baileyana. The stigmas of all species are receptive prior to anthesis and can be artificially pollinated at this stage provided that the stigma lobes can be separated. Pollen viability, tested for P. pandorana and P. jasminoides, deteriorated during the flower life although pollen samples with a low Fluorescein diacetate response (5-14%) still produced many pollen tubes which grew to the base of the style. For all species tested, pollen tubes grew into the ovary in both outcross pollinations and in self pollinations which are known to be incompatible indicating that the incompatibility barrier is within the ovary. Pollen-ovule ratios, determined for P. pandorana and P. jasminoides, were low compared with other published pollen-ovules ratios for taxa with breeding systems based on outcrossing. © 1993 CSIRO.

Norin 26 with Aegilops crassa, Ae. juvenalis or Ae. vavilovii cytoplasm (all D2 type) has been studied relative to its photoperiodic response of male sterility and fertility restoration patterns. Alloplasmic lines of 'Norin 26' with a D2 type cytoplasm showed almost complete male sterility under long-day conditions (?15 h), but high male fertility under short-day conditions (?14.5 h). No significant influence of temperature on reduction in male fertility was observed. Thus, this type of male sterility is called 'photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility' (PCMS). The PCMS is expressed in the form of pistillody of stamens. Histological studies revealed that there were incomplete ovule-like structures instead of tapetal cells and pollen grains in the pistillate stamens. The floret differentiation stage of the plant is the stage that is sensitive to photoperiod. The PCMS can be used as a new means for hybrid wheat production, named 'two-line system'. The PCMS line is maintained and multiplied by self-fertilization under short-day conditions, and hybrid seed can be produced by crossing the PCMS line with a pollinator line under long-day conditions. In contrast to the system of hybrid wheat production using the T. timopheevi cytoplasm, the present system requires only PCMS and pollinator lines. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Aegilops crassa; hybrid wheat; PCMS; photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility; Triticum aestivum; wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001872208

After crossing the F1 hybrids, many seeds of the F2, B1 and hybrid plants were harvested. Multivalent formation was high in the chromsome configuration for the PMCs of F2, B1 and hybrid plants, suggesting that crossing over might occur between them. Many different types of aneuploids were obtained in the progenies of the F2, B1 and hybrid plants. It is suggested that different types of normal egg cells may be produced by one-by-one or little-by-little chromosome addition.
