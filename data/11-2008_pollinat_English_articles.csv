Multan, Pakistan. The community of pollinators was composed of two bees (Order: Hymenoptera) and eight true flies (Order Diptera). Among bees, Apis dorsata proved to be an abundant pollinator (2.85±1.57 individuals/25 plants) while among true flies Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae) had the maximum abundance of 14.00±4.61 individuals/25 plants. All the insect pollinator species reached peak activity during 10:00 to 12:00 h. Eupeodes corollae (Syrphidae) exhibited the most efficient foraging behavior by visiting 17.14±1.38 flowers in 147.5±8.14 seconds on an umbel. A. dorsata was revealed as the most effective pollinator, however, based on seed setting results for visits by single species over 20 minutes and which produced 506 seeds/umbel/20 minute visit.

A recently recognized ailment, Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), devastates colonies, leaving hives with a complete lack of bees, dead or alive. Up to now, estimates of honey bee population decline have not included losses occurring during the wintering period, thus underestimating actual colony mortality. Our survey quantifies the extent of colony losses in the United States over the winter of 2007-2008. Methodology/Principal Findings: Surveys were conducted to quantify and identify management factors (e.g. operation size, hive migration) that contribute to high colony losses in general and CCD symptoms in particular. Over 19% of the country's estimated 2.44 million colonies were surveyed. A total loss of 35.8% of colonies was recorded; an increase of 11.4% compared to last year. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom suggesting that a contagious condition may be a causal factor. Sixty percent of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without dead bees, and thus possibly suffered from CCD. In PA, losses varied with region, indicating that ambient temperature over winter may be an important factor. Conclusions/Significance: Of utmost importance to understanding the recent losses and CCD is keeping track of losses over time and on a large geographic scale. Given that our surveys are representative of the losses across all beekeeping operations, between 0.75 and 1.00 million honey bee colonies are estimated to have died in the United States over the winter of 2007-2008. This article is an extensive survey of U.S. beekeepers across the continent, serving as a reference for comparison with future losses as well as providing guidance to future hypothesis-driven research on the causes of colony mortality.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149187868

We obtained DNA sequences from museum specimens of Moho and Chaetoptila collected in Hawaii 115-158 years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences supports monophyly of the two Hawaiian genera but, surprisingly, reveals that neither taxon is a meliphagid honeyeater, nor even in the same part of the songbird radiation as meliphagids. Instead, the Hawaiian species are divergent members of a passeridan group that includes deceptively dissimilar families of songbirds (Holarctic waxwings, neotropical silky flycatchers, and palm chats). Here we designate them as a new family, the Mohoidae. A nuclear-DNA rate calibration [9] suggests that mohoids diverged from their closest living ancestor 14-17 mya, coincident with the estimated earliest arrival in Hawaii of a bird-pollinated plant lineage [10]. Convergent evolution, the evolution of similar traits in distantly related taxa because of common selective pressures, is illustrated well by nectar-feeding birds [11], but the morphological, behavioral, and ecological similarity of the mohoids to the Australasian honeyeaters makes them a particularly striking example of the phenomenon. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index gradually increased along with seed development and reached the highest levels at 38 d after pollination (DAP). The TSR showed that, during 14 to 42 DAP, total soluble sugar content was independent of the vigor parameters determined in present experiment, while the reducing sugar content had a significant effect on seed vigor. TSR equations between seed reducing sugar and seed vigor were also developed. There were negative correlations between the seed reducing sugar content and the germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index, respectively. It is suggested that the seed germination, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index could be predicted by the content of reducing sugar in sweet corn seeds during seed development stages. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.",Kernel nutritive component; Seed vigor; Sh2 sweet corn; Time series regression (TSR) analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57549101010

Using information available from different transcriptional profilings of Arabidopsis thaliana mature pollen, we showed that the only aquaporins that are selectively and highly expressed in mature pollen are two TIPs: AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1. Pollen exhibited a lower number and more exclusive type of aquaporin expressed genes when compared to other single cell transcriptional profilings. When characterized using Xenopus oocyte swelling assays, AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 showed intermediate water permeabilities. Although they displayed neither glycerol nor boric acid permeability they both transported urea.

However, pollen from closely related individuals in the local neighbourhood might reduce fruit set or increase fruit abortion in self-incompatible tree species. We investigated the role of neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness on individual fruit set and abortion in the neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia in a large forest plot in central Panama. Using nested neighbourhood models, we found a strong positive effect of increased conspecific density on fruit set and maturation. However, high neighbourhood genetic relatedness interacted with density to reduce total fruit set and increase the proportion of aborted fruit. Our results imply a fitness advantage for individuals growing in high densities as measured by fruit set, but realized fruit set is lowered by increased neighbourhood relatedness. We hypothesize that the mechanism involved is increased visitation by density-dependent invertebrate pollinators in high-density populations, which increases pollen quantity and carry-over and increases fruit set and maturation, coupled with self-incompatibility at early and late stages due to biparental inbreeding that lowers fruit set and increases fruit abortion.

For quantitative characters with evolutionary parameters satisfying empirical observations and two approximate inequalities that we derived, disjunct clusters in the population flowering phenology originated within a few thousand generations in the absence of disruptive natural or sexual selection. Our simulations and the conditions we derived showed that cluster formation was promoted by limited population size, high mutational variance of flowering time, short individual flowering phenology and a long flowering season. By contrast, cluster formation was hindered by inbreeding depression, stabilizing selection and pollinator limitation.

We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant-pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non-experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits. In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain effective pollination and plant reproduction. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649217495

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant-pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year. These results suggest that plant-pollinator networks vary in detail through time, while retaining some basic topological properties. This dynamic aspect of community-scale interactions has implications for both ecological and evolutionary inferences about pollination mutualisms. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649184525

In the present study, Polygala vayredae was used to answer the following questions. (1) How does male and female success affect the floral longevity of individual flowers? (2) How does delaying fertilization affect the female fitness of this species? • Methods: Floral longevity was studied after experimental pollinations involving male and/or female accomplishment, bagging and open pollination. The reproductive costs of a delay in the moment of fertilization were evaluated through fruit set, seed-ovule ratio and seed weight, after pollination of flowers that had been bagged for 2-18 d. • Key Results: Senescence of the flowers of P. vayredae was activated by pollen reception on the stigmatic papillae, while pollen removal had no effect on floral longevity. Nonetheless, a minimum longevity of 8 d was detected, even after successful pollination and pollen dissemination. This period may be involved with the enhancement of male accrual rates, as the female accomplishment is generally achieved after the first visit. Floral life span of open-pollinated flowers was variable and negatively correlated with pollinator visitation rates. Delayed pollination had a major impact on the reproductive success of the plant, with fruit set, seed-ovule ratio and seed weight being significantly diminished with the increase of flower age at the moment of fertilization. • Conclusions: A strong relationship between pollination and floral longevity was observed. Flowers revealed the ability to extend or reduce their longevity, within some limits, in response to the abundance of efficient pollinators (i.e. reproductive fulfilment rates). Furthermore, with scarce or unpredictable pollinators, a long floral life span could maintain the opportunity for fertilization but would also have reproductive costs on production of offspring. Reduced female fitness late in the flower's life could shift the cost-benefit balance towards a shorter life span, partially counteracting the selection for longer floral life span potentially mediated by scarce pollination services. © The Author 2008.

Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km 2 in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549104135

First, the effect of habitat disturbance on variation in pollen-ovule ratio was determined. The second factor studied was the pollination type, used as a surrogate for the efficiency of pollination. Because seed mass is known to be strongly correlated with the pollen-ovule ratio it was also included in the analyses to examine if a possible effect of habitat disturbance or pollination type is still valid after accounting for the effect of seed mass. Furthermore, phylogenetically comparative methods were used to investigate whether the correlations between traits were maintained through evolutionary history or are only present in recent species data, i.e. in analyses that do not consider phylogenetic relationships between species. In conflict with the reproductive assurance hypothesis, habitat disturbance did not have a significant effect on interspecific: pollen-ovule ratio variation. In contrast, pollination type accounted for a significant proportion of the variation in pollen-ovule ratios, even after taking into account the strong effect of seed mass. General results do not differ between the cross-species and phylogenetic comparative approaches.

Many of the negative genetic impacts of population fragmentation can be ameliorated by gene flow and it has been suggested that in wind-pollinated tree species, high or even increased levels of gene flow are a feature of fragmented populations, although several studies have disputed this. We have used a combination of nuclear microsatellites and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) analysis of chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the levels and patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation in fragmented populations of juniper (Juniperus communis) in Ireland and inform conservation programs for the species. Significant population differentiation was found for both chloroplast and nuclear markers, indicating restricted gene flow, particularly over larger geographic scales. For conservation purposes, the existence of genetically distinct clusters and geographically localised chloroplast haplotypes suggests that the concept of provenance should be taken into account when formulating augmentation or reintroduction strategies. Furthermore, the potential lack of seed dispersal and seedling establishment means that ex-situ approaches to seed and seedling management may have to be considered. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Gene flow; Habitat fragmentation; Juniper; Juniperus communis; Phylogeography,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949122520

Acquiring information about their environment enables pollinators to exploit floral resources optimally, and hence strongly affects their fitness. Despite their evolutionary importance, spatial resource distribution and social information use have never been addressed in a plant-pollinator framework. We experimentally tested the effects of inadvertent social information (ISI) use (without or with an experienced demonstrator) in relation to spatial flower distribution (random or patchy) in foraging Bombus terrestris. We studied naïve bees' associative learning when confronted with rewarding and nonrewarding flowers that differed slightly in colour, reproducing the natural mimicry of deceptive species. Naïve bees were more efficient foragers with than without a demonstrator in the patchy flower distribution, suggesting that they used ISI from conspecifics, probably in the form of social attraction at the patch scale. In the random flower distribution, however, ISI did not improve performance of naïve bees, and could not replace individual sampling. Analyses of nonrewarding intraspecific transitions indicate that the efficiency of naïve bees in deceptive species pollination was lowered when rewarding and nonrewarding inflorescences were patchily distributed and especially when bees relied on ISI. Thus, spatial flower distribution and ISI availability interact in determining pollinator behaviour, which has important consequences for plant community pollination. This suggests that bumblebees are adapted to exploit patchily distributed resources socially, a characteristic that might be exploited by deceptive plant species. By coupling behavioural and community ecology, this study offers promising perspectives for cognitive ecology studies in plant-pollinator interactions. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Bombus terrestris; bumblebee; deceptive species pollination; foraging behaviour; inadvertent social information; plant-pollinator interaction; social attraction; spatial flower distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56049085563

After this stage, the quantity of fig odor decreases. The effects of F. hispida volatiles from receptive figs (figs at the female floral stage, when they are pollinated) and interfloral figs (between the female floral and male floral stages) on their pollinator were studied, together with responses to compounds present in the odor. Odors emitted by both receptive and interfloral figs were attractive to the pollinator. However, wasps preferred the odor of receptive figs to that of interfloral figs even though the quantity of interfloral volatiles increased. Three monoterpenes that included linalool (major constitutent) and two minor compounds limonene and ?-pinene from the receptive fig volatiles were used to test the pollinator responses. The levoisomer and racemic mixtures of linalool were attractive to the pollinator at high doses, but the dextroisomer was neutral. (±)-Limonene and (-)-?-pinene at high doses were even less attractive to the pollinator than clean air and were neutral at low doses, while (R)-(+)-, (S)-(-)-limonene were neutral at all doses.

(R)-(+)-linalool and (-)-?-pinene enhanced the attractiveness of (S)-(-)-linalool to the pollinator, while enantiomers of limonene did not. These results suggest that both quality and quantity of fig volatiles regulate C. solmsi marchali response and that quality is the main host-finding and floral stage-distinguishing cue for the pollinator.

This study focuses on the invasive Heracleum mantegazzianum and distance-dependent effects on pollination of Mimulus guttatus in abandoned grassland over 2 years. First, we examined pollinator abundance in yellow traps at 0, 10, 30 and 60-200 m from H. mantegazzianum. We then placed M. guttatus plants at the same distances to monitor effects of the invasive species on pollinator visitation and seed set of neighbouring plants. Finally, we conducted a garden experiment to test if deposition of H. mantegazzianum pollen reduces seed set in M. guttatus. No distance effect was found for the number of bumblebees in traps, although the invasive species attracted a diverse assemblage of insects, and visitation of M. guttatus was enhanced close to H. mantegazzianum. This positive effect was not reflected by seed set of M. guttatus, and heterospecific pollen decreased seed set in these plants. Overall there is little evidence for negative effects of the invasive species on pollination of neighbouring plants, and flower visitation even increases close to the invaded patches. The functional role of the invader and suitable control strategies need further clarification, since removal of H. mantegazzianum may actually damage local pollinator populations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Facilitation; Heracleum mantegazzianum; Invasion; Mimulus guttatus; Pollinator abundance; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54849424631

However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649244778

To explore the potential role that secondary metabolites play in pollination, we studied the pollination systems of five Diplomorpha species in Japan by investigating their floral morphology and flower-visiting insect fauna. We also analyzed the composition and temporal emission pattern of floral volatiles in one of the species to determine if there were any characteristics associated with the observed flower visitors. In Diplomorpha, anthesis began at dusk and various nocturnal moths were found visiting the flowers, often carrying numerous pollen grains on their proboscises. However, no hawkmoths were observed visiting Diplomorpha flowers. Diurnal insects visited the flowers less often, and most of them had short mouthparts and did not effectively contact the stigma. The floral scent of Diplomorpha sikokiana was released only at night when the moths were active and consisted mainly of monoterpenes and benzenoids, with a small amount of a sesquiterpene. The present study is the first to examine the pollination system of Diplomorpha and suggests that these plants exhibit a range of floral features associated with pollination by nocturnal moths. The single ovule in Diplomorpha flowers probably does not favor pollination by optimally foraging bees, which are more likely to cause intraplant pollen transfer, and might have facilitated adaptation to pollination by nocturnal moths, despite the lower number of pollen grains that are carried by these insects. © 2008 The Authors.",Diplomorpha; Floral scent; Nocturnal pollination; Settling moth; Thymelaeaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55649091072

We combined measures of pollinator visitation and pollen deposition to estimate the importance of major groups of pollinators for each species, and we calculated proportional similarity in the pollinator assemblage among species. We found that 12 species of Iochroma, encompassing a range of flower colors and sizes, were principally pollinated by hummingbirds and, in many cases, by the same hummingbird species. The remaining species were either pollinated by a mix of hummingbirds and insects (two species) or exclusively by insects (two species). Based on proportional similarity values, the overlap in pollinator assemblages was found to be higher for sympatric species than for allopatric ones, reflecting sharing of local pollinator fauna. However, observations of individual pollinator fidelity, perhaps related to territorial interactions among hummingbirds, suggested that pollinators may still contribute to the reproductive isolation of sympatric congeners.

The species has both chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers on individual plants. The objective of this study is to clarify the reproductive characteristics that affect the selfing rate of M. vaginalis. An emasculation experiment revealed that the CH flowers emasculated just after flower opening produced seeds. The seed production in the flowers emasculated just after flower opening was less than that of the flowers emasculated and hand-pollinated with pollen from another plant. These results indicate that, although self-pollination before anthesis occurs, cross-pollination also can produce seeds. An experimental manipulation of light and the emergence time of the plants revealed that more than half of the flowers produced were CL flowers and the CH/CL ratio decreased with reduced light availability. The plants that emerged later produced as many CH flowers as those that emerged earlier. There was no significant difference between the CH and CL flowers in the seed number per fruit and the seed mass. These results suggest that M. vaginalis has reproductive characteristics that make the selfing rate high; however, outcrossing also can occur. Under favorable light intensity conditions, such as on the edges of paddy fields or in fallow fields, M. vaginalis will produce more CH flowers and will have a higher outcrossing rate than in shaded conditions. © 2008 The Authors.",Aquatic weed; Cleistogamy; Monochoria vaginalis; Paddy field; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56649117557

Fruits cannot be grown commercially without the use of crop protection agents, either from organic or chemical origin. The use of products with toxic effects is banned during flowering, and precise pre-flowering intervals have to be respected in Good Agricultural Practice. Bee pollination is essential for fruit crops to guarantee maximal fruit quality (shape and size) and quantity (yield weight). Fruit growers in Belgium depend mostly on non-commercial beekeepers to provide sufficient colonies for adequate pollination. Under optimal circumstances, beekeepers and fruit growers have mutual benefits from this cooperation as both honey and fruit yield increase. In those European countries with a monitoring scheme, acute bee poisoning incidents have decreased considerably and hardly cause problems at present. In recent years, some concerns arose around sublethal effects (i.e., behavioural changes) of chemical crop protection on bees, especially with regard to increased winter mortality. Even though short-term effects can indeed be induced in individually exposed bees, studies that exposed complete colonies did not reveal any long-term consequences at colony level.

The magnitude of the population size change was approximately 500-fold, indicating that the population of this wasp and its host was likely highly compressed during the last glacial period. The lack of significant population differentiation (FST &lt; 0.02, for all pairwise FST values) may be due to rapid postglacial expansion facilitated by long-distance dispersal, although a low frequency of first-generation migrants was detected.

Population means of floral traits were closely correlated with population scores on the first principal coordinate axis of the genetic distance matrix using outlier loci, and with the allelic frequencies of four of the outlier loci.

By measuring seed set resulting from single pollinator visits, we evaluated effectiveness (mean seed set per visit) and importance of pollinator (effectiveness times frequency of visitation) of insects visiting flowers of A. asterias. Results indicate that the most common visitor, Macrotera lobata, is a relatively ineffective pollinator, while the less common Diadasia rinconis is the most effective and important pollinator. Two behavioral variables (duration of visit, whether or not visitors landed on the stigma) were assessed as possible predictors of fruit set. While duration of visit was not predictive of fruit set, there was a positive correlation between fruit set and the proportion of visits a visitor landed on the stigma when entering the flower.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649201889

Experiments were carried out to observe the changes in antioxidant activities and pigment fading throughout the flower's vase life. As Dendrobium Sonia and Dendrobium Savin White senesces, there is discolouration, the flower appears dull and weak, which indicates pigment loss and this observation is correlated with the L* a*/b* colour readings carried out using the Chromameter CR-200. The total anthocyanin quantification using the pH-differential method showed that polllinated Dendrobium Sonia had lower concentration compared to unpollinated Dendrobium Sonia.

To improve breeding processes, more knowledge of Plus- Hybrid effects with modern plant material must be acquired. The Plus-Hybrid abilities of 12 modern European hybrids from diverse breeders, representing all three types of CMS, were evaluated in a field study at three locations in Switzerland in 2005; their suitability as pollen receptors and pollen donors were tested by combining their male-sterile and male-fertile forms with two respective known tester hybrids. The variations caused by the CMS effect on the yield of a specific genotype in a given environment ranged from -8 to +8%. These variations did not depend on the type of male-sterile cytoplasm. The Plus-Hybrid effect for a specific combination was consistent among locations, but the extent of the effect depended on the environment. The test pollinator induced an average Plus-Hybrid effect of +6.9% on the grain yield of the set of CMS hybrids. After allo-pollination, the yield of seven of the 12 CMS hybrids increased by more than +8% (mainly due to a higher thousand kernel weight). Although the impact of the type of cytoplasm was not significant, hybrids with C and T cytoplasm showed a stronger response to allo-pollination than hybrids with S cytoplasm.

The cultivar 'Siirt' and Male 13 were used in the experiments. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of pistil receptivity, pollen mixtures, and pollen application distances on fruit set using artificial pollination in pistachios. To determine the receptivity of female flowers, anthesis was accepted as day 0, and then one application was carried out on 0, 2, and 4 days after anthesis; and repeated applications were done on 0+2, 0+4, 2+4, and 0+2+4 days, separately. Pollen and wheat flour was mixed to obtain 1%, 5%, 10%, 50%, and 100% pollen mixture, and these pollen mixtures were sprayed from 25, 50, and 100 cm distances from the inflorescence clusters with a small hand sprayer. Thus, fruit set was determined for the applications. Different pollen mixtures were applied to a microscope slide, covered with Vaseline, from three different application distances to determine the number of pollen grains per unit area by artificial pollination. The number of pollen grains per unit area was counted under a light microscope and calculated per 1 mm2. Finally, adequate pollen numbers to pollinate a flower were determined. The results indicate that for optimum fruit production of pistachio, 5% and 50% pollen mixtures should be sprayed at a distance of 100 cm at 0 and 4 days after anthesis. The adequate number of pollen grains to pollinate a flower was calculated as 14 or 15 pollen grains per flower in pistachio. Increased number of pollen per stigma area would cause excessive flower abscission after a certain point, and this could be the cause of low fruit set in pistachios. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2008.",Artificial pollination; Fruit set; Pistachio; Pistil receptivity; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149158056

However, nectar rewards are known to be produced in about 80 species in eight genera from four different tribes. These nectar-producing species are pollinated by both vertebrates and invertebrates. • Methods: The floral morphology and anatomy of 14 species was studied in six genera of nectar-producing Melastomataceae (Blakea, Brachyotum, Charianthus, Huilaea, Meriania and Miconia). Anatomical methods included scanning electron microscopy, and serial sections of paraffin-embedded flowers. • Key Results: All vertebrate-pollinated melastome flowers have petals that do not open completely at anthesis, thus forming a pseudo-tubular corolla, while closely related species that are bee pollinated have rotate or reflexed corollas. In most species, nectar secretion is related to stomatal or epidermal nectaries and not filament slits as previously reported. Moreover, the nectar is probably supplied by large vascular bundles near the release area. Blakea and Huilaea have nectary stomata located upon the dorsal anther connective appendages. Brachyotum also has nectary stomata on the anther connectives, but these are distributed lengthwise along most of the connective. Meriania may release nectar through the anther connective, but has additional nectary stomata on the inner walls of the hypanthium. Miconia has nectary stomata on the ovary apex. Charianthus nectaries were not found, but there is circumstantial evidence that nectar release occurs through the epidermis at the apex of the ovary and the lower portions of the inner wall of the hypanthium. • Conclusions: Nectar release in Melastomataceae is apparently related to nectary stomata and not filament slits. The presence of nectary stomata on stamens and on ovary apices in different lineages suggests that the acquisition of nectaries is a derived condition. Nectary location also supports a derived condition, because location is strongly consistent within each genus, but differs between genera. © The Author 2008.

Their farmed seed is sought to help rehabilitate western rangelands in those regions. This study of the reproductive biologies and pollinator faunas of C. lutea and C. serrulata is the first for this cosmopolitan family, the sister family to the Brassicaceae. Unlike the S-allele self-incompatibility systems of some Brassicaceae, both species of Cleome were found to be self-fertile and capable of some autogamy. Compared with selfing, outcrossing did not enhance seed set, seed viability or seedling vigor for either species (in fact, selfed progeny were more robust). Large, openly visited plants yielded >20 000 seeds each. Like several species of the sister family Capparaceae, flowers of both species first shed their pollen, secreted nectar and became receptive nocturnally. Although no nocturnal visitors were found, both Cleome species attracted a diverse array of diurnal native bees, wasps and butterflies. Among the many floral generalist bees that work Cleome flowers for pollen and nectar are two managed agricultural pollinators, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata. These observations bode well for pollinating C. lutea and C. serrulata in small commercial seed fields. It appears that diverse wild bees would benefit from the addition of native Cleome to restoration seed mixes, with the objective of sustaining native pollinator faunas during the first few years of postfire plant community rehabilitation.",Apiformes; Brassicaceae; Capparaceae; Pollination; Seedling fitness; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55649119397

It has been shown that genetic, climatic and other factors such as plant size affect the timing of flowering and its duration. The spatial and temporal variation in the reproductive phenology of the columnar cactus Stenocereus thurberi and its association with plant size and environmental cues was studied. • Methods: Flowering was monitored during 3 years in three populations of S. thurberi along a latitudinal gradient. Plant size was related to phenological parameters. The actual and past weather were used for each site and year to investigate the environmental correlates of flowering. • Key Results: There was significant variation in the timing of flowering within and among populations. Flowering lasted 4 months in the southern population and only 2 months in the northern population. A single flowering peak was evident in each population, but ocurred at different times. Large plants produced more flowers, and bloomed earlier and for a longer period than small plants. Population synchrony increased as the mean duration of flowering per individual decreased. The onset of flowering is primarily related to the variance in winter minimum temperatures and the duration to the autumn-winter mean maximum temperature, whereas spring mean maximum temperature is best correlated with synchrony. • Conclusions: Plant size affects individual plant fecundity as well as flowering time. Thus the population structure strongly affects flowering phenology. Indications of clinal variation in the timing of flowering and reproductive effort suggest selection pressures related to the arrival of migrating pollinators, climate and resource economy in a desert environment. These pressures are likely to be relaxed in populations where individual plants can attain large sizes. © The Author 2008.

Determining factors affecting pollinator visitation is the key to understanding the reproductive success of animal-pollinated plants. The inclination of the ground where plants grow, which has been little studied, could be one such factor. There may be differences in foraging performance when visiting flowers on horizontal planes compared with flowers on inclines planes. And if this is the case, pollinators may have a preference for horizontal or inclined planes. To test these possibilities, a series of laboratory experiments with bumble bees and arrays of artificial flowers were conducted. 2. In the first experiment, bees were presented with a pair of floral arrays, one on a horizontal plane and one sloping. The bees preferred visiting flowers on the horizontal array. 3. In the second experiment, bees were allowed to forage on a flower array tilted at various angles ranging from 0° (horizontal) to 90° (vertical). It was found that their foraging performance decreased with increasing angles, showing a 9.1% reduction from 0° to 90° arrays. This reduction was caused by an increased travel time between flowers, when moving upslope or downslope. 4. These results suggest that plants growing on steep slopes may be less preferred by pollinators. Future studies are needed to clarify how slopes affect pollinator behaviour in field conditions and the ecological influences on plant reproduction. © 2008 The Author.",Bumble bee; Foraging rate; Inclination of the ground; Pollination; Sloping habitats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55349122918

Caterpillars of the widespread endemic moth Zelleria maculata feed inside flower buds of the endemic mistletoes Peraxilla tetrapetala and P. colensoi in New Zealand. We measured flower predation rates between 1995 and 2007 at 24 sites throughout New Zealand and assessed Zelleria feeding impact on fruit set. Zelleria predation showed a strong latitudinal gradient, being rare in the North Island but affecting 81% of flowers in 1996 at Waipori (Otago) and averaging > 38% at Waipori and Eglinton (Fiordland). The reasons for this pattern are unknown, but a wasp parasitoid of Zelleria, Campoplex sp. (Ichneumonidae), may be less common further south. Rates of Zelleria attack were higher in mistletoes growing several metres above ground and in less fragmented habitats (i.e. in shaded positions, and away from edges), and higher in P. tetrapetala than P. colensoi. An experiment following 1005 tagged P. tetrapetala flowers at two sites showed that Zelleria attack significantly reduces both pollinator-flower-opening rates (required for effective pollination) and fruit set rates. Zelleria attack increased the chance of a flower not being opened by pollinators from 11 to 37% at Ohau in 1996 (reducing fruit set from 28% to 7.9%) and flower non-opening from 6 to 30% at Craigieburn in 1995 (fruit set: 44.4% to 16.6%), representing reductions in fruit set of 72% and 63% at the two sites. Therefore, Zelleria reduces reproduction in Peraxilla spp. through both pollinator deterrence and direct loss of flowers at many sites. This could affect conservation of these mistletoes, which are seed-limited and in decline. However, Zelleria impact is reduced by its avoidance of edge habitat, as P. tetrapetala is more abundant and flowers more heavily on edges. © New Zealand Ecological Society.",Edge effects; Florivory; Herbivory; Loranthaceae; P. tetrapetala; Parasitoid wasp; Peraxilla colensoi; Plant reproduction; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149163098

To determine the relative effects of shared biochemistry and/or localized population-level phenomena on floral scent phenotype, floral scent composition and emission rate were examined in five wild populations of colour polymorphic Hesperis matronalis (Brassicaceae). • Methods: Floral scent was collected by in situ dynamic headspace extraction on purple and white colour morphs in each of five wild populations. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy of extracts allowed determination of floral scent composition and emission rate for all individuals, which were examined by non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively, to determine the contributions of floral colour and population membership to scent profile variation. • Key Results: Despite the fact that colour morph means were very similar in some populations and quite different in other populations, colour morphs within populations did not differ from each other in terms of scent composition or emission rate. Populations differed significantly from one another in terms of both floral scent composition and emission rate. • Conclusions: Shared biochemistry alone cannot explain the variation in floral scent phenotype found for H. matronalis. Such a result may suggest that the biochemical association between floral scent and floral colour is complex or dependent on genetic background. Floral scent does vary significantly with population membership; several factors, including environmental conditions, founder effects and genetics, may account for this differentiation and should be considered in future studies. © The Author 2008.

One option for reinvigorating these populations is the introduction of genetic material from other sites, but in some cases fitness may be reduced as a result of outbreeding depression. Here the pollination biology of the rare shrub Grevillea repens is studied across its natural range and reproductive responses following cross-pollination among populations are examined to determine factors that may be limiting sexual reproduction and the potential for genetic rescue. • Methods: Pollen manipulation treatments (self-, autogamous self-, cross- and open pollination) were applied to flowers to examine the breeding system and fruit and seed production in five populations of G. repens. Pollen production, presentation and viability were investigated and interpopulation crosses of increasing genetic distance performed among the populations. • Key Results: The study species is self-incompatible and displayed very low natural seed set over two seasons, due partly to low pollen viability in one of the populations. Within-population crossing increased fruit and seed production at some sites, indicating pollinator limitation. Interpopulation crosses further increased reproductive output in one population, suggesting mate limitation, and for this site there was a positive relationship between genetic distance among populations and the size of genetic rescue benefits. However, in other populations there was a decrease in fruit and seed set with increasing genetic distance. • Conclusions: The results highlight that management strategies involving interpopulation crosses can improve reproductive output in small, isolated populations of rare plants, but guidelines need to be developed on a population by population basis. © The Author 2008.

A major question in the study of mutualism is to understand how mutualists may revert to antagonists that exploit the mutualism (i.e. switch to cheating). In the classic pollination mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, the cheater moth Tegeticula intermedia is sister to the pollinator moth T. cassandra. These moth species have similar ovipositor morphology, but T. intermedia emerges later, oviposits into fruit rather than flowers, and does not pollinate. 2. We tested if the pollinator, T. cassandra, was pre-adapted to evolve a cheater lineage by comparing its emergence and oviposition behaviour on yucca fruit to a distantly related pollinator, T. yuccasella, that differs in ovipositor morphology and oviposition behaviour. We predicted that if T. cassandra was pre-adapted to cheat, then these pollinators would emerge later and be able to oviposit into fruit in contrast to T. yuccasella. 3. Contrary to expectations, a common garden-rearing experiment demonstrated that emergence of T. cassandra was not significantly delayed relative to T. yuccasella. Moth emergence patterns overlapped broadly. 4. No choice oviposition experiments with female moths demonstrated that both pollinator species attempted to oviposit into fruit, but only T. cassandra was successful. Four out of 84 T. cassandra successfully oviposited into older fruit, whereas zero out of 79 T. yuccasella oviposited into older fruit. The rarity of the cheating behaviour in pollinators, however, meant that no significant difference in oviposition ability was detected. 5. The results suggest that a shift in emergence phenology is likely not a pre-adaptation to the evolution of cheating, but that the ability to successfully lay eggs into fruit may be. The results also demonstrate that cheating attempts are rare in these pollinator species and, hence, the evolutionary transition rate from pollinator to cheater is likely to be low. © 2008 The Authors.",Behaviour; Emergence; Exploitation; Obligate pollination mutualism; Oviposition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55349136615

Statistical analysis on D6 lines showed significant differences between progenies and their rice parental line in several main traits, including plant height (49.2164.5 cm), panicle number (12.138.2), panicle length (20.330.3 cm), length of sword leaf (13.857.5 cm), leaf width (11.125.2 mm), grain number of main panicle (142.0367.0), percentage of seed setting (0.899.0%), 1000-grain weight (19.733.8 g) and time from germination to panicle emergence (90.0108.0 days). Most of the variable coefficients were above 20% (the highest was 40.8%). Through pedigree selection of these plants, genetically stable lines were obtained, which are useful for rice breeding.

However, this could be difficult due to barriers to interspecific hybridization. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of different rice species based on seed set in an interspecific hybridization program. Five Oryza glaberrima genotypes and four interspecific inbred lines were used as female (seed) parents and two improved O. sativa and two interspecific inbred lines (NERICA 2 and NERICA 3) as male (pollen) parents to generate 36 cross combinations representing the North Carolina Design II mating scheme. Four groups of crosses were made: group A (O. glaberrima O. sativa), group B (O. glaberrima Interspecific), group C (Interspecific O. sativa) and group D (Interspecific Interspecific). Groups A and B had seed-set levels of about 10%. Group D had the highest seed-set level, with a mean of 19%. The least seed-set was for group C (6% seed-set). Overall, the study indicated a serious challenge in making interspecific hybrids, because only 11% of 8031 pollinations were successful in setting seed, compared with 45% within O. glaberrima and 70% within O. sativa crosses under similar conditions. Higher sterility was observed in backcrosses involving the O. glaberrima cytoplasm as compared with single crosses. The backcrosses involving O. glaberrima cytoplasm were completely sterile with no seed-set except with the CG 14 cytoplasm.",Genotypes; Interspecific hybrids; Oryza; Pollination; Seed set; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949084939

To further understand the genetic architecture of the postzygotic RI, we analyzed genes causing hybrid ste- rility and hybrid breakdown in a rice inter-subspecific cross. Here we report hybrid male sterility caused by epistatic interaction between two novel genes, S24 and S35, which were identified on rice chromosomes 5 and 1, respectively. Genetic analysis using near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying IR24 (ssp. indica) seg- ments with Asominori (ssp. japonica) genetic background revealed a complicated aspect of the epistasis. Allelic interaction at the S24 locus in the heterozygous plants caused abortion of male gametes carrying the Asominori allele (S24-as) independent of the S35 genotype. On the other hand, male gametes carrying the Asominori allele at the S35 locus (S35-as) showed abortion only when the IR24 allele at the S24 locus (S24-ir) was concurrently introgressed into the S35 het- erozygous plants, indicating that the sterility phenotype due to S35 was depen- dent on the S24 genotype through negative epistasis between S24-ir and S35-as alleles. Due to the interaction between S24 and S35, self-pollination of the double heterozygous plants produced pollen-sterile progeny carrying the S24-irl S24-ir S35-as/S35-ir genotype in addition to the S24 heterozygous plants. This result suggests that the S35 gene might function as a modifier of S24. This study presents strong evidence for the importance of epistatic interaction as a part of the genetic architecture of hybrid sterility in rice. In addition, it suggests that diverse systems have been developed as postzygotic RI mechanisms within the rice.",Epistasis; Gene mapping; Hybrid male sterility; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849292298

In this study, potential interactions between a dimorphic (yellow or purple flowers) non-rewarding orchid Dactylorhiza sambucina and a dimorphic (yellow and blue flowers) rewarding, co-flowering species, Viola aethnensis, were explored in a natural stand in southern Italy. To evaluate the interactions between these two species, plots of all possible arrays of presence/absence of the four colour morphs were arranged in the field and fruit production of the orchid morphs assessed. Natural aggregations of both colour morphs of the orchid had the highest reproductive fitness for each colour morph. Patterns in fitness variation detected in treated plots provided direct and indirect evidence that D. sambucina may benefit from the co-occurrence of V. aethnensis through floral mimicry and/or magnet species effect. Since the fitness of each orchid morph was strongly increased by the presence of a viola morph of similar colour, a double mimetic effect occurs between the two species, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. Moreover, the co-occurrence of an orchid morph with a non-matching viola resulted in competition for pollinators, whereas in the absence of the rewarding plant the fitness was balanced due to positive interactions between the two orchid colour morphs. These findings suggest that D. sambucina, like many other European deceptive orchids, possesses a set of display traits suitable for exploiting potential facilitative interactions with a number of rewarding species. In addition, the unequal morph frequencies occurring in natural populations could result from unbalanced events in floral mimicry.",Colour morphs; Plant interactions; Remote habitat hypothesis; Reproductive success; Rewardless orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149263053

Pollen-collecting bees should therefore discriminate against female-phase flowers to maximise their rate of pollen harvest, but this behaviour would reduce plant fitness due to inferior pollination. Here, we test the hypothesis that flowers use pollen-mimicking floral guides to prevent flower-phase discrimination. Such floral guides resemble pollen in spectral reflection properties and are widespread among angiosperm flowers. In an array of artificial flowers, bumblebees learned less well to discriminate between flower variants simulating different flowering phases when both flower variants carried an additional pollen-yellow guide mark. This effect depended crucially on the pollen-yellow colour of the guide mark and on its spatial position within the artificial flower. We suggest that floral guides evolved to inhibit flower-phase learning in bees by exploiting the innate colour preferences of their pollinators. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Bumblebee; Colour preference; Dichogamy; Floral colour pattern; Floral guide; Learning; Mimicry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56749180782

We describe here the flowering dynamics and crossability among six native populations of bitter fennel collected from four localities in Israel, one from Sinai Desert (Egypt), and one from Mersin (Turkey) and grown from under agricultural conditions. Timing and duration of the stigma's receptivity were evaluated morphologically, enzymatically, and by determining fruit set in response to artificial pollination. Self-compatibility rates and crossability within and between populations were also determined in response to artificial pollination. Although the populations initiated flowering at different times through the season, in all cases the stigma's receptivity peaked between six and eight days after anthesis (yellow-bud stage) and lasted for seven days. Pollen can primarily germinate on the stigmata but the stylopodium serves too as a site for pollen germination, albeit at a lower efficiency (0-10% fruit set) as compared to stigmata (25-54%). Although there is complete dichogamy within flowers, umbels, and branches, there in not enough dichogamy between branches, and geitonogamy is therefore possible. A dditionally, all populations displayed a high (0.7-3.7) index of self-compatibility (ISI), indicative of substantial self pollination. Although interbreeding among populations was proven using artificial pollination, geographical isolation and the high likelihood for self-pollination probably restricts gene flow and contributes to the phenotypic diversity observed in wild fennel populations.

Nevertheless, this practice involves intensive labor and increases the production costs. Nowadays, in Japan, it is becoming necessary to reduce such labour intensive tasks and hence the costs of production of Japanese pear. Thus, the objective of this work was to test if application of putrescine before hand-pollination improves the fruit set and fruit size in the 'Housui' cultivar of Japanese pear. In 2003, three putrescine treatments (0 or control, 0.01 and 1.0 mM) were applied on 'Housui' flowers to observe the effect on fruit set during 8 days after flower anthesis, and also on final fruit size. Additionally, with the same putrescine treatments, early-, normal- and late-thinning was practiced to measure final fruit size. The results showed that putrescine increased the fruit set only in late-pollinated flowers; that is, 7 and 8 days after anthesis. This increase of fruit set was possible due to a higher pollen germination percentage in the putrescine-treated stigmas, as observed on in vitro pollination tests. Although fruit size was clearly influenced by the period of thinning, it was not influenced by putrescine treatments in either experiment. This work suggests that applications of putrescine might help farmers to handpollinate about 2 days more than the normal period, without risk of failing to set fruit.",Ethylene; Fruit thinning; Hand-pollination; Polyamines; Pyrus pyrifolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450186851

Furthermore, the available studies generally evaluate the effects of nectar robbing on female fitness, disregarding the male component. Here we measured the effects of the nectar-robbing bumblebees on male (measured as pollen analogue flow distance) and female (measured as seed production) reproductive success in the insect-dependent Polygala vayredae, a narrow endemic species from the pre-Pyrenees (Spain). Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye dispersion between robbed and non-robbed flowers within the population. Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers presenting higher reproductive outcomes. However, no effect on seed weight was detected among treatments. The data obtained suggest that in this species, nectar robbing has important indirect and negative effects on plant fecundity, through both male and female functions, due to a modification in the foraging behaviour of legitimate visitors. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bumblebees; Female fitness; Foraging behaviour; Male fitness; Nectar robber; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55149109452

Resistance to infection by A. flavus is poorly understood. The objectives of this investigation were to identify potential candidate markers associated with resistance in maize kernels and pollen grains to A. flavus using a mapping population derived from a cross between Mp313E (resistant) and SC212m (susceptible) inbred lines. The parents, F1, and F2 plants, were planted in the field in 2005. Each F2 plant was self-pollinated to produce F2:3 seed. Fresh pollen collected from parental lines, F1, and each F2 plant was germinated on a growth medium in the presence of A. flavus conidia. Selfed seeds from parents, F1, and F2 plants, were challenged with A. flavus conidial suspension and incubated using a medium-free method. Percent kernels uninfected (PKU) and number of pollen grains germinated (NPG) were recorded. A linkage map was constructed with JoinMap 3.0 using DNA profiles of all F2 individuals produced from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) markers. Interval mapping and multiple-QTL model (MQM) mapping analyses were performed using MapQTL 4.0 software. Three marker-QTL associations were observed for log-transformed PKU. Potential markers associated with this trait were also identified via discriminant analysis (DA). The markers identified via DA pointed to the same genomic regions as identified via the QTL-mapping strategy. For log-transformed NPG, five marker-QTL associations were detected. One QTL was associated with a TRAP marker. The DA confirmed the existence of three QTL. The QTL detected for NPG were different from the QTL detected for PKU. Thus, resistances of pollen and kernels to A. flavus appeared to be controlled by different genetic systems/mechanisms. Correlation between pollen germination and percent kernel infection was negligible (r = 0.067), suggesting that the two traits can be improved independently. © 2008 by The Haworth Press, Inc.",Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP); Aspergillus flavus; Discriminant analysis (DA); Maize (Zea mays L.); Quantitative trait loci (QTL); Target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849215143

The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 4. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 5. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. 6. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely. © 2008 The Authors.",Apparent competition; Density dependence; Food webs; Global warming; Invertebrates; Janzen-Connell; Mast fruiting; Networks; Rainforest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54349124627

Replicated field experiments were conducted in 29 environments using 20 QPM and seven normal maize genotypes. The normal maize genotypes included released cultivars, advanced breeding lines, one improved (Manakamana-3) and one local check (farmers' variety). Grain yield, days to flowering, plant and ear height, prolificacy, husk cover tightness and plant and ear aspect were analyzed. Stability and genotype superiority for grain yield was determined using genotype and genotype x environment (GGE) biplot analysis that compares among a set of genotypes with a reference ideal genotype, which will have the highest average value of all genotypes and be absolutely stable. The highest yielding QPM genotype in each year had significantly higher grain yield than the local check and higher or comparable yield to the improved check. Across years, many QPM genotypes produced significantly higher grain yield than the local check. Two genotypes (S03TLWQ-AB-01 and Obatampa) produced significantly higher grain yield than the improved check. GGE-biplot analysis showed that five of the seven most superior genotypes for grain yield were QPM (S03TLWQ-AB-01, Obatampa, S01SIYQ S99TLWQ-HG-AB and S99TLWQ-HG-A). Deuti and Manakamana-3 were the most superior among the normal maize cultivars. These genotypes also had acceptable to superior agronomic traits. Grain yield showed significant positive correlation with plant and ear height and prolificacy. The results show that superior open pollinated QPM genotypes were comparable to the outstanding cultivars of normal maize in performance stability and agronomic traits. The findings of this study provide new information on stability of the open pollinated QPM genotypes tested across warm rainfed hill environments. These cultivars are also adapted to other developing countries and this information could be useful for international and national QPM improvement programs. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Genotype x environment interaction; GGE-biplot; Grain yield; Maize; Performance; Quality protein maize; Stability; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59049105806

Assessment of these sequential stages and corresponding subprocesses may be useful in identifying the most critical stages. Accordingly, to assess the factors that may determine the altitudinal range limits of the high mountain Mediterranean plant Silene ciliata, a set of demographic stages, from flower production to establishment of 2-yr-old plants, and their influence on recruitment probability were examined using a step-by-step approach. We integrated florivory, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation as pre-dispersal factors, and seedling emergence and survival as post-dispersal determinants of recruitment. Three populations were monitored at the southernmost margin of the species along its local altitudinal range. Previous studies suggest that seediness is strongly limited by summer drought especially at the lower boundary of the species, a situation that may worsen under current global warming. Our results showed that recruitment was mainly limited by low seed production in the pre-dispersal stage and low seedling emergence and survival in the post-dispersal stage, probably due to environmental harshness in summer. By contrast, biotic factors responsible for propagule loss, such as flower and fruit predation, had a minor effect on the probability of plant recruitment. Although the relative importance of transition probabilities was similar among populations along the altitudinal range, comparatively lower flower production significantly reduced the number of recruited plants at the lowest altitude population. This demographic bottleneck, together with increased competition with other species favoured by climate warming, might collapse population growth and limit persistence at the lower altitudinal range of the species, raising its low local altitudinal edge. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549114868

Before using this technology for commercial production, it is essential that somatic embryogenesis-derived plants be tested in field conditions. Therefore, we established a field test at Union Vale Estate, Saint Lucia. Thirty- to 50-yr-old trees were selected for clonal propagation as potentially high yielding based on local farmers observations. Clonal plants were propagated in vitro from immature flowers by embryogenesis and micropropagation. Multiple plants from nine genotypes were acclimated to greenhouse conditions then returned to Saint Lucia and planted in a field. Orthotropic rooted cuttings and locally propagated open pollinated seedlings were also planted for a total of 214 trees. Growth data were collected every 4-6 mo. including: stem diameter, stem height, length of the longest jorquette branch, number of jorquette branches, and dates of first flowering and fruiting. At 4.5 yr after planting in the field there were no major differences in all growth parameters among the propagation methods evaluated with exception of the orthotropic rooted cuttings. Trees grown from seeds were slightly taller then trees propagated by the other methods. Trees propagated as orthotropic rooted cuttings exhibited smaller average stem diameters, shorter stem heights to the jorquette, and shorter jorquette branches. We concluded that somatic embryo-derived plants demonstrated normal phenotypes in field conditions and have growth parameters similar to plants propagated by traditional methods. © 2008 The Society for In Vitro Biology.",Cocoa; Micropropagation; Orthotropic rooted cuttings; Somatic embryos,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60049093594

This process can cause the extinction and decline of associated insect species. The present paper is the first study analyzing wild bee diversity and abundance patterns in wet meadows. We surveyed bees using pan traps, transect walks, and nest traps in four Molinietum (Poaceae) meadows near Kraków, Poland. During one season, we identified a relatively high ?-diversity of wild bees, consisting of 105 species (13 from the Polish Red List) belonging to 22 genera, which represent almost one-fourth of the Polish bees. The wild bee fauna between sites was not variable, which was indicated by low ?-diversity. We found that nesting preference of bees did not differ between the study area and xerothermic meadows, which suggests that differentiation in bee fauna of wet and dry grasslands is mostly due to food specialization rather than nesting preference. Abundance analysis of the bee community showed that the least abundant species were disproportionately comprised of oligolectic species, indicating that species closely associated to plants of wet meadows are especially threatened.

Hanna Avenue, Indianapolis, IN 46227, United States, Department of Anthropology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, United States","The prevalence of mixed mating among plant species is intriguing from an evolutionary perspective because most theoretical models predict that plant species should evolve towards either complete selfing or complete outcrossing. Several ecological factors, such as pollinator variability, have been invoked to explain this discrepancy. However, empirical data detailing the mechanisms of selfing and the impact of selfing on progeny fitness are rare. One trait that might allow a high degree of variability in outcrossing rates is dichogamy, the temporal separation of male and female functions within perfect flowers. The present study examines the potential for mixed mating by using floral manipulations in five populations of Saponaria officinalis, a protandrous perennial herb. Bagged flowers produced fewer seeds than control flowers and open-pollinated emasculated flowers, and the emasculated flowers were not significantly different from the controls. Controlled pollinations indicated that there were no differences between seed production in geitonogomous, outcrossed or control groups. There were some differences in seed weight between the pollination treatments, but there was no effect of pollen source on germination date or seedling weight. These results suggest that insect visitation provides an important contribution to seed set, even though self-pollination is capable of producing viable seeds. © 2008 The Authors.",Autonomy; Geitonogamy; Inbreeding depression; Mixed mating; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55649099880

Expressed sequence tags for 711, 757 and 384 relevant clones, respectively, were obtained and checked manually. The proportion of sequences with no clear function decreased from 35% to 20%, and a large increase in storage protein sequences (i.e. 5% to 38%) was observed from stages (i) to (iii). The remaining major categories included metabolism (11%-13%), transcription-RNA processing-protein synthesis (13%-20%), protein destination (5%-9%), cellular communication (3%-9%) and cell rescue-defence (4%). Good agreement was generally found between category rank in the 10-DAP transcriptome and the recently reported 14-DAP proteome, except that kinases and proteins for RNA processing were not detected in the latter. In the metabolism category, the respiratory pathway transcripts represented the largest proportion (25%-37%), and showed a shift in favour of glycolysis at 21 DAP. At this stage, amino acid metabolism increased to 17%, whereas starch metabolism surprisingly decreased to 7%. A second experiment focused on carbohydrate metabolism by comparing gene expression at three levels (transcripts, proteins and enzyme activities) in relation to substrate or product from 10 to 40 DAP. Here, two distinct patterns were observed: invertases and hexoses were predominant at the beginning, whereas enzyme patterns in the starch pathway, at the three levels, anticipated and paralleled starch accumulation, suggesting that, in most cases, transcriptional control is responsible for the regulation of starch biosynthesis. © 2008 The Authors.",Carbohydrate metabolism; Coordinated development; Expression profiling; Maize endosperm; Starch metabolism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949090562

Functional analysis of cDNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that NRT1.6 is a low-affinity nitrate transporter and does not transport dipeptides. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and ?-glucuronidase reporter gene analysis showed that expression of NRT1.6 is only detectable in reproductive tissue (the vascular tissue of the silique and funiculus) and that expression increases immediately after pollination, suggesting that NRT1.6 is involved in delivering nitrate from maternal tissue to the developing embryo. In nrt1.6 mutants, the amount of nitrate accumulated in mature seeds was reduced and the seed abortion rate increased. In the mutants, abnormalities (i.e., excessive cell division and loss of turgidity), were found mainly in the suspensor cells at the one- or two-cell stages of embryo development. The phenotype of the nrt1.6 mutants revealed a novel role of nitrate in early embryo development. Interestingly, the seed abortion rate of the mutant was reduced when grown under N-deficient conditions, suggesting that nitrate requirements in early embryo development can be modulated in response to external nitrogen changes. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62549096826

We systematically investigated the genetic architecture of CPP using patterns of transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in F2 and backcross hybrids between closely related species of Mimulus (Phrymaceae) with divergent mating systems. We found that CPP in Mimulus hybrids was polygenic and was the majority source of interspecific TRD genome-wide, with at least eight genomic regions contributing to the transmission advantage of M. guttatus pollen grains on M. guttatus styles. In aggregate, these male-specific transmission ratio distorting loci (TRDLs) were more than sufficient to account for the 100% precedence of pure M. guttatus pollen over M. nasutus pollen in mixed pollinations of M. guttatus. All but one of these pollen TRDLs were style-dependent; that is, we observed pollen TRD in F 1 and/or M. guttatus styles, but not in M. nasutus styles. These findings suggest that species-specific differences in pollen tube performance accumulate gradually and may have been driven by coevolution between pollen and style in the predominantly outcrossing M. guttatus. © 2008 The Author(s).",Evolutionary genomics; Mating systems; Quantitative genetics; Reproductive isolation; Selection - sexual; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57249108311

The objective of this study was to assess, characterize, quantify and suitably utilize available genetic variability. Genetic divergence among 31 genotypes was determined using nine characters of C. borivilianum of indigenous origin via Mahalanobis D2 statistic. The genotypes were grouped into eight clusters. Intra-cluster distance was largest for cluster VIII (nine genotypes), followed by cluster I (six genotypes). Inter-cluster D2 values recorded between cluster II and III and those between cluster III and VI indicated the possibility of raising transgressed hybrids from cross hybridization programs using divergent parents of these four clusters. The clustering pattern indicated that geographical diversity was not necessarily related with genetic diversity. Leaf number contributed most toward divergence (15.8%), followed by finger number, length and width (each with at least 13% contribution) and leaf length (12.1%). Correlation analysis for root yield (dependent variable) and the remaining seven plant traits (independent variables) revealed that leaf number, leaf length and finger number, which had contributed highly to divergence, had also significant associations with root yield.

This stage of endosperm development is important in determining final seed size and is a model for studying aspects of cellular and molecular biology, such as the cell cycle and genomic imprinting. However, the small size of the Arabidopsis seed makes high-throughput molecular analysis of the early endosperm technically difficult. Laser capture microdissection enabled high-resolution transcript analysis of the syncytial stage of Arabidopsis endosperm development at 4 d after pollination. Analysis of Gene Ontology representation revealed a developmental program dominated by the expression of genes associated with cell cycle, DNA processing, chromatin assembly, protein synthesis, cytoskeleton- and microtubule-related processes, and cell/organelle biogenesis and organization. Analysis of core cell cycle genes implicates particular gene family members as playing important roles in controlling syncytial cell division. Hormone marker analysis indicates predominance for cytokinin signaling during early endosperm development. Comparisons with publicly available microarray data revealed that approximately 800 putative early seed-specific genes were preferentially expressed in the endosperm. Early seed expression was confirmed for 71 genes using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, with 27 transcription factors being confirmed as early seed specific. Promoter-reporter lines confirmed endosperm-preferred expression at 4 d after pollination for five transcription factors, which validates the approach and suggests important roles for these genes during early endosperm development. In summary, the data generated provide a useful resource providing novel insight into early seed development and identify new target genes for further characterization. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57749096998

It is supposed to change the frequencies of species trait states in species assemblages. We hypothesize that the flora of urban and rural areas differs in the frequency of trait states and ask which traits enable a plant to cope with the urban environment. We tested our hypothesis in Germany, which was divided into grid-cells of ca 130 km2. We distinguished urbanized (with more than 33% urban land use; n = 59), agricultural (with more than 50% agricultural land use; n = 1365) and semi-natural (with more than 50% forest and semi-natural land use; n = 312) grid-cells and calculated the proportions of plant species per trait state in each grid-cell. Multiple linear regressions explained the log-transformed ratio of one proportion to another with land use (urban, agricultural, semi-natural) and the environmental parameters (climate, topography, soils and geology). Additionally, linear mixed effect models accounted for the effects of land use and biogeography and differences in sample size of the three grid-cell types. Urbanized and rural areas showed clear differences in the proportion of trait states. Urbanized grid-cells had e.g., higher proportions of wind-pollinated plants, plants with scleromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by animals, and lower proportions of insect-pollinated plants, plants with hygromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by wind than other grid-cells. Our study shows that shifts in land use can change the trait state composition of plant assemblages. Far-reaching urbanization might consequently homogenize our flora with respect to trait state frequency.",Compositional data; Plant traits; Species distribution patterns; Urban ecology; Urban flora; Vascular plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149229285

Auxins, another kind of hormone, can also induce parthenocarpic fruit growth in tomato, although their possible interaction with GAs is unknown. We showed that fruit development induced by the auxins indole-3-acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were significantly reduced by the simultaneous application of inhibitors of GA biosynthesis, and that this effect was reversed by the application of GA 3. This suggested that the effect of auxin was mediated by GA. Parthenocarpic fruits induced by 2,4-D had higher levels of the active GA 1, its precursors and metabolites, than unpollinated non-treated ovaries, but similar levels as those found in pollinated ovaries. Application experiments of radioactive-labelled GAs to unpollinated ovaries showed than 2,4-D altered GA metabolism (both biosynthesis and catabolism) in vivo. Transcript levels of genes encoding copalyldiphosphate synthase (SlCPS), SlGA20ox1, SlGA20ox2 and SlGA20ox3, and SlGA3ox1 were higher in unpollinated ovaries treated with 2,4-D. In contrast, transcript levels of SlGA2ox2 (out of the five SlGA2ox genes known to encode this kind of GA-inactivating enzyme) were lower in ovaries treated with 2,4-D. Our results support the idea that auxins induce fruit-set and growth in tomato, at least partially, by enhancing GA biosynthesis (GA 20-oxidase, GA 3-oxidase and CPS), and probably by decreasing GA inactivation (GA2ox2) activity, thereby leading to higher levels of GA 1. The expression of diverse Aux/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and auxin response factors, which may be involved in this effect of auxin, was also altered in 2,4-D-induced ovaries. 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Aux/IAA; Auxin; Auxin response factors; GA metabolism; Gibberellin; Micro-Tom,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57549114235

Using primers deduced from the N-terminal peptide sequence of a group 1 allergen of Bahia grass pollen extract separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the complete Pas n 1 cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and cloned. Biological relevance of recombinant Pas n 1 expressed in Escherichia coli was assessed by serum IgE reactivity and basophil activation. Twenty-nine of 34 (85%) consecutive patients presenting with grass pollen allergy were skin prick test positive to Bahia grass pollen.

The first sign of degeneration appeared at the subcellar level in the embryo sac within 2 DAP. Embryo development is significantly slowed. Almost all abortion is at the proembryonic, 8 to 24 cell stage. Embryo abortion is characterized by the appearance of large vacuoles in the embryo proper. The cy- toplasm either is low in density or shows gradual condensation. And various changes occur in the ab- normal cytoplasm: the cell walls expand, the ER becomes vesiculate, and osmiophilic deposits accu- mulate along the cell wall. The central cell degenerates to a greater degree. In particular, endosperm is absent or degenerates with either electron-dense condensed cytoplasm or dispersed cytoplasm in the early free-nuclear stage. The membrane system of organelles collapses. Dictyosomes and ER also become highly vesiculated and almost all organelles disperse within the central cell, while ribo- some number is sharply decreased. In the aborted embryo sac, nucellar cells show a high degree of degeneration with condensed cytoplasm and vacuolation.

To transfer alien genetic germplasm into maize background, F1 hybrids were generated by using Z. mays ssp. mexicana as the female parent and cultivated maize inbred line Ye515 as the male parent. Alien introgression lines, with a large range of genetic diversity, were produced by backcross and successive self-pollinations. A number of alien introgression lines with the predominant traits of cultivated maize were selected. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) proved that small chromosome segments of Z. mays ssp. mexicana had been integrated into the maize genome. Some outstanding alien introgression lines were evaluated in performance trials which showed 54.6% hybrids had grain yield greater than that of hybrid check Yedan12 which possessed 50% Ye515 parentage, and 17.1, 9.9% hybrids had grain yield competitive or greater than those of Nongda108 and Zheng958, which were elite commercial hybrids in China, respectively.

However, few studies suggested that anthocyanins in vegetative tissue might also function in plant defence, although the evidence for such a function is not particularly strong. Here, we investigated whether anthocyanins contribute to fruit defence against fruit-rot fungi. We found that the risk of fruit-rot in grape varieties infected with Botrytis cinerea decreased with increasing anthocyanin contents. Moreover, anthocyanin contents directly inhibited growth rates of nine fruit-rot fungi on agar plates. Anthocyanins reduced fungal growth by 50% in the concentrations that typically characterise unripe blackberries and by 95% in the concentrations that typify ripe blackberries. We conclude that anthocyanins in fruits not only function to attract animal vectors, but that they also contribute to fruit defence.

(Polygonaceae) are described here. This is a typical annual species of the Polygonaceae, extending widely over wetlands in the lowlands of the Japanese Islands and in north-eastern Asia. A unique feature of P. thunbergii is that each individual plant possesses two reproductive systems, that is, chasmogamy and cleistogamy. Chasmogamous flowers are borne on the cymose inflorescences with 10-20 flowers, reddish to pinkish in color, that attract various insects. A variety of pollinators visit the flowers, including horse flies and small butterflies, which obviously guarantees a certain degree of outbreeding among different individuals. The achenes produced are ovoid, trigonous, yellowish-brown and dull in color and do not possess any specific seed dispersal mechanisms. Several cleistogamous flowers are produced at the tip of underground runners elongated from the base of the stems into the soil layers. The reproductive strategy of P. thunbergii is unique as an annual and the two reproductive systems (chasmogamy and cleistogamy [geocarpy]) allow populations to persist in unstable changing environments, such as the flood plains of rivers and wetlands developed at the margins of ponds or lakes. © 2008 The Author.",Annual; Chasmogamy; Cleistogamy; Dimorphic monocarpy; Plasticity; Summer-green annual,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55649092905

Beekeeping in Croatia has a long tradition. In comparison to pasture potential and necessity for pollination of cultivated and wild plants, present beekeeping is inadequately developed and distributed in different regions. According to data of the Croatian Livestock Center (2008) there are 313 978 honeybee colonies registered in the 2007 in Croatia on professional and sideline apiaries. The majority of honeybee colonies is placed in Pannonian region with 238 300 (76%), second in representation is in Mediterranean region with 59 763 (19%) and less represented is in Mountain region with 15 915 (5%) honeybee colonies. Yearly honey production is approximately 5 000 t and 2 000 t of national honey consumption (0.4 kg per capita) gives possibility for honey export. Croatia exported 1 051 in 2003, but 274 t of honey in 2007, which indicates on significant export decreasing trend. Normal 10 % of winter colony losses till 2007 increased in 2007/2008 on 55 615 (41.71 %) in Pannonian region, 13 892 (37.46 %) in Mediterranean and 5 359 (32.71 %) in Mountain region. There is a need to make beekeeping much more flexible to fit into an integrated agricultural system, as well as more oriented to the consumers' demands, to be able to increase competitiveness.",Beekeeping; Colony losses; Honey export; Honey production; Honeybee colonies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57349130053

It was grown on more than 20 million ha in the world in 1997, of which over one million ha were in West Asia-North Africa (WANA) countries, where Iran grew 60,000 ha and Syria 50,000. There is potential for substantial increase In sunflower area and production on dry land if optimum management practices are applied. An important management consideration is choosing a high yielding, good quality variety that will maximize seed yield and minimize seed costs. This study investigated the influence of hybrids and open pollinated varieties on yield and other agronomic traits of sunflower. Ten hybrids and eleven open pollinated varieties were compared, under rainfed conditions (Jindiress) and with minimum supplementary irrigation (Tel Hadya, ICARDA Aleppo, Syria) in 1993. Soil at Tel Hadya is red clay loam characterized as Calcixerollic Xerochrept (Inceptisol), Chromic Calcixeret (Vertisol): at Jindfiress, the soil is Calcixerollic Xerochrept (Inceptisol). All of them are thermic and clayey to very fine clay. At both stations, equally good and statistically similar yields were obtained with hybrids and varieties. The average yield of the 21 cultivare was 2,207 kg/ha at Jindiress and 2,080 kg/ha at Tel Hadya. The average yield of the 11 OPVs was 2,073 kg/ha and that of the 10 hybrids was 2,220 kg/ha, which was similar. Thus, less costly OPVs can be used instead of costly hybrid seed. Farmer can also produce their own seed with little training; the cost will be one fourth of that of hybrids, which are imported and seldom available on time. In the absence of hybrids, F 2 seed is resorted to by farmers which reduces the yields considerably. The rainfall during 1993 was lower than the long-term average; It was 277 mm (TH) and 417 mm (Jindiress). The information obtained are important to farmers, allowing them to maximize economic returns from rainfed areas by using limited supplementary irrigation in lowrainfall locations and during dry years.",Dry land; Hybrids; OPVs; Sunflower; Supplementary irrigation; WANA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955863078

Genetic diversity of the species was investigated using six allozyme systems. Allelic frequencies were scored representing eight polymorphic and five monomorphic loci. Coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) was 0.3019, which indicated great genetic differentiation. The number of alleles per locus was 2.6154, the percentage of polymorphic loci was 61.54, and the expected heterozygosity was 0.2462 in all populations. Genetic diversity in A. maroccana was high in comparison to self-pollinated species. In total, nine heterozygotes resulting from outcrossing were found in the progeny from M1, M3, M4, M22 and M26. The population of M7 had peculiar alleles Pgd-2SS and Pgd-1SS in high frequency. M9 had the lowest level of diversity out of the 11 populations. Geographic and genetic distances between all the populations were not significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.0996). Cluster analysis showed that two groups, (M1, M22, M2 and M4) and (M3, M23, M8, M5 and M26) were apparently differentiated. Two populations of the Casablanca group, M7 and M9 were independent from each other, and were separated distinctly from the other populations. Genetic diversity of the Rommani and Casablanca groups was almost the same in all the parameters. This was due to the similar man-made habitat such as roadside or rich fertile soil and brown clay soils. The population size of A. maroccana was small and restricted to the narrow central Morocco with great genetic differentiation so that genetic diversity may be reflected from the results of genetic drift and outcrossing heterozygote segregation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Avena maroccana; Genetic differentiation; Genetic diversity; Isozyme; Oat; Plant germplasm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57649178705

The varieties Santa Luzia and Thaís, with and without protection with organza cloth, were used in natural crosses and crosses with emasculation. The methods were evaluated for pollination efficiency and fruit traits, namely: weight, length, width, length/width ratio and mean number of seeds. RAPD analysis indicated that all progenies were derived from the controlled crosses, which confirmed the pollination efficiency of the methods applied. The pollination efficiency varied from 4.57% to 8.37% among the crosses. The use of emasculation without organza cover was statistically best for fruit yield. The variety Santa Luzia is recommended as female parent for hybridization.

The alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata F.) is a major pollinator used in alfalfa seed production in North America. Alfalfa leafcutter bees have a pollinator preference for purple-flowered subsp. sativa plants over the yellow-flowered subsp. falcata plants. This study was conducted to quantify the pollinator preference by observing the amount of hybrid seed produced using alfalfa leafcutter bees. Two pollination environments and three different proportions of falcata parents in pollination cages (50%, 75%, and 90%) were included to determine shifts in quantities of hybrid seed produced due to environment and/or pollinator subsp. falcata flower availability. Total and hybrid seed amounts and seed size differed between environments. Seed size differences were observed between subspecies. Hybrid seed yields were 57% of expected hybridity on an experiment mean basis. In crossing cages with higher subsp. falcata parent proportions, a decreased amount of observed percent hybridity compared with expected hybridity was observed (i.e., 50% subsp. falcata = 72%, 75% subsp. falcata = 59%, and 90% subsp. falcata = 39% of expectation). Seed yield per plant and seed size did not differ between cages with differing subsp. falcata parent proportions. Plant-to-plant variation for seed yield and seed weight was observed; however, no plant-to-plant variation for observed percent hybridity of expected hybridity was found. This study suggests using 50% subsp. falcata plants to 50% subsp. sativa plants will produce 36% hybrid seed (or 72% of expectation) in alfalfa seed production fields using alfalfa leafcutter bees as pollinators and suggests increasing percent subsp. falcata parentage will decrease the percent of hybrid seed observed compared with expectation. © 2008 by The Haworth Press, Inc.",Alfalfa; Alfalfa leafcutter bee; Falcata; Hybrids; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249105276

Individual behaviour is central to society's impact on the environment. However, due to the complexity of environmental issues, much of the political debate and technology development is inaccessible to consumers and based on the values, interpretations and priorities of experts. User-centred, user-involved and participatory processes are fundamental in design disciplines such as interaction design and participatory design. Research into the possibilities for cross-pollination of design for sustainability and user-centred design has distinguished several strategies for design-led behavioural change. The strategies differ with regard to the levels of control and responsibility that users are left with, ranging from empowerment through information about consequences of behaviour to blocking behaviour or forcing sustainable practices upon individuals. By considering technological behaviour-steering strategies in the light of science and technology studies and theory on technological mediation, the paper addresses the ethical issues that arise and discusses how designers can contribute to more sustainable consumption patterns without compromising quality of life, individual freedom and democratic rights. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",Behavioural steering; Design for sustainability; Ethics; Participation; Persuasion; Technocracy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650137408

The presence of feeders may lead to increases in local hummingbird populations and decreases in the use of native plants. We examined how the presence of feeders influenced the rate of hummingbird visits to a changing array of flowering plants in southeastern Arizona. Feeder visits represented approximately 59% of all visits during our yearlong study, but were less common in times of high floral abundance. The ratio of feeder visits to total visits was negatively related to overall floral abundance and to the abundance of the hummingbird-favored plant, Calliandra californica. The regular use of feeders by hummingbirds, which increases during periods of low floral availability, may have important implications for pollinator-plant relationships by reducing plant reproductive output. Additionally, this inverse relationship may affect estimates of hummingbird abundance and must be considered when analyzing data from studies that use feeders to attract hummingbirds. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.",Banding; Calliandra californica; Feeder; Floral abundance; Hummingbirds; Population estimate; Southern Arizona,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649655789

We evaluated their fruit set and development characteristics under greenhouse and growth chamber conditions in comparison with the parent lines ('Talina2/1', a parthenocarpic double-haploid line of 'Talina', and 'Nakate Shinkuro') and with two other lines ('Senryo Nigou' and 'LS1934').

The normal fruit set of 'Nakate Shinkuro' was higher than that of 'Talina2/1' but lower than those of the new parthenocarpic lines.

The high normal fruit sets of the new parthenocarpic lines may have resulted from the introduction of pseudo-parthenocarpy, and this, combined with parthenocarpy, contributed to their high normal fruit sets.

Whether and how it could be successfully applied in practical breeding mostly depends upon the efficiency of haploid embryo production. To perfect the protocols of haploid embryo induction, the efficiency of haploid embryo production between in vitro culture of cut plant and intact plant growth for hybrid spikes with two F1 wheat hybrids and two maize varieties was compared. Effects of different cutting plant times and formulas of nutrient solutions for cut plant culture on haploid embryo formation were also studied. Results indicated that the embryo rate of in vitro culture was 3.29 times that of intact plant growth, with the figures of 31.6% vs 9.6%, respectively. The optimal time for cut plant culture was 24 h after pollination. Formulas of nutrient solutions significantly affected the efficiency of haploid embryo induction. With an embryo rate of 0-35.5%, adding calcium phosphate in the culture solution at 3 g•L-1 could raise the caryopsis and embryo rates.

Seedlings isolated from pollinators in a greenhouse flowered for the first time and formed viable seeds during their fourth spring of development, demonstrating the capacity of D. mexicana to self-pollinate or to form seeds via apomixis. These observations improve our understanding of the habitat and reproductive biology of this endemic species. © 2008 by the New England Botanical Club.",Endemic plants; Leatherwood; Reproductive biology; Thymelaeaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74049092999

The near isogenic line, T65WxS 6 (W593), carrying a segment of chromosome 6 from W593 showed a low seed setting when pollinated with pollen grains of T65wx in spite of the fact that the reciprocal cross gave a high seed setting. The unidirectional or asymmetric crossing barrier was previously explained by an interaction between Cif and cim, both of which acted sporophytically, resulting in the cross-incompatibility reactions in the female (CIF) and male (CIM), respectively. In the genetic model, endosperm abortion is induced only when CIF gametes are fertilized with CIM gametes. This predicted that the double homozygote for Cif and cim might be self-incompatible since the plant expresses both CIF and CIM simultaneously. However, we failed to obtain such a self-incompatible plant by transferring Cif into a cim plant. The present results showed that CIF is controlled not only by Cif but also by an additional gene(s) loosely linked with it. We propose here that Cif 1 (formerly named as Cif) and Cif 2 determine CIF. In addition, Cif 2 and Cim were not separated due to restriction of recombination, which might explain why it is difficult to obtain a self-incompatible rice plant expressing both CIF and CIM. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Crossability; Female specificity; Inheritance; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; Unidirectional cross-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55349143869

Two alternative transcripts of the T gene, T1170 and T1243, showed different expression patterns at different developmental stages. In this work, the potential roles of these two transcripts were studied in Arabidopsis thaliana through over-expression under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Transgenic plants over-expressing the T1243 transcript produced anthers that appeared devoid of pollen and almost fully collapsed siliques, showing a severe male sterility phenotype, while transgenic lines over-expressing T1170 were normal. To confirm the above results, we constructed T1243-RNAi lines in A. thaliana, and T1243 was over-expressed using these lines as recipients. Pollen was normal in the T1243 knocked-out lines. In the control wild type lines expressing T1243, plants showed pollen abortion. We observed a positive correlation between the sterility phenotypes and the expression levels of T1243. Test-crossing was done by pollinating T1243 transgenic lines with wild type pollen. About half of the progeny showed pollen abortion, indicating that T1243, one of the T gene transcripts, can cause a male sterility phenotype. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The culmination of clearing and cultivating land at the farm scale has resulted in highly modified landscapes and a perceived loss of ecosystem services from pest control and pollination. We examine the literature: (i) to identify the appropriate spatial scale for managing pests, natural enemies and pollinators; and (ii) for evidence that farm-scale changes (due to agricultural intensification) across a landscape have resulted in a tipping point favouring pests and hindering pollinators. Although there is limited information to draw firm conclusions, the evidence suggests that actions undertaken on individual farms have an impact both on their neighbours and regionally, and that the culmination of these actions can lead to changes in population dynamics of pests, natural enemies and pollinators. For major pest species, there is reasonable evidence that grain growers may benefit from improved management and higher yields by implementing area-wide pest management strategies on a landscape scale in collaboration with growers of other crops that also share these pests. As yet, for natural enemies and pollinators there is little direct evidence that similar area-wide initiatives will have a greater effect than management strategies aimed at the field and farm level. Managing pests, natural enemies and pollinators beyond the scale of the field or farm is technically and socially challenging and will required a well defined research agenda, as well as compromise, balance and trading among stakeholders. We highlight critical knowledge gaps and suggest approaches for designing and managing landscapes for ecosystem services. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55849100021

However, recent evidence derived from both gross morphological and molecular studies supports the inclusion of Scuticaria and Dichaea in sub-tribes Maxillariinae and Zygopetalinae, respectively. The present paper describes the labellar micromorphology of both genera and seeks to establish whether labellar characters support the assignment of Scuticaria and Dichaea to these sub-tribes. • Methods: The labella of four species of Scuticaria and 14 species of Dichaea were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and their micromorphology was compared with that of representative species of Maxillariinae sensu lato and Zygopetalinae (Huntleya clade). • Key Results and Conclusions: In most specimens of Scuticaria examined, the papillose labella bear uniseriate, multicellular, unbranched trichomes. However, in S. steelii (Lindl.) Lindl., branched hairs may also be present and some trichomes may fragment and form pseudopollen. Multicellular, leaf-like scales were also present in one species of Scuticaria. Similar, unbranched hairs are present in certain species of Maxillaria Ruiz & Pav. (Maxillariinae sensu stricto) and Chaubardia Rchb.f. (Huntleya clade). As yet, moniliform, pseudopollen-forming hairs have not been observed for Zygopetalinae, but their presence in Scuticaria steelii, Maxillaria and Heterotaxis Lindl. supports the placing of Scuticaria in Maxillariinae. As other genera are sampled, the presence of branched hairs, hitherto unknown for Maxillariinae sensu lato, may prove to be a useful character in taxonomy and phylogenetic studies. Euglossophily occurs in Dichaea, as well as Chondrorhyncha Lindl. and Pescatorea Rchb.f. (Huntleya clade), and all three genera tend to lack distinctive labellar features. Instead, lip micromorphology is relatively simple and glabrous or papillose. However, two of the Dichaea species examined bear unicellular, labellar trichomes very similar to those found in Bifrenaria Lindl. (pollinated by both euglossine bees and Bombus spp.), and this feature may have arisen by convergence in response to similar pollination pressures. © The Author 2008.

Flowering occurs during dry winter months (June-September) and the large inflorescences attract a wide range of birds. Flowering phenology and nectar production were studied during three seasons (2005-2007) at a dense population of aloes in Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve. Three flower stages were recognised; 1) immature phase, 2) male phase, and 3) female phase, with extremely high nectar volumes (mean = 248 ?l/flower) in stage 2, the stage to which most avian visitors are attracted. Nectar sugar concentration was very low (12% w/w) in stage 2 when the volume was highest. Comprehensive nectar volume and concentration data were gathered and showed little daily variation, despite a 24 h temperature range of up to 20 °C. The extremely high volume and low concentration of the nectar proved to be consistent with a generalist bird pollination syndrome. A wide range of avian visitors (42 species; 59% of the resident bird community recorded during flowering) fed on nectar throughout the day, but a decrease in nectar standing crop was only evident at midday.

On the basis of their floral traits, it was predicted that two African Colchicum species (C. scabromarginatum and C. coloratum) are rodent-pollinated. • Methods: Field studies were carried out in the semi-arid Succulent Karoo region of South Africa. Live trapping of rodents was conducted and pollen loads on the rodents were quantified. The daily periodicity of nectar production was determined. Selective exclusion and controlled pollination experiments were also conducted. • Key Results: Live-trapped rodents were found to carry large amounts of Colchicum pollen on the fur of their snouts, and in their faeces. Birds were occasional pollinators of flowers of C. coloratum. During the evening, nectar volume and concentration increased for both species. When vertebrates were excluded from C. scabromarginatum and C. coloratum plants, there was a significant decrease in seed set compared with open control plants. By contrast, vertebrate exclusion did not significantly affect seed production of a congener, C. hantamense, which has floral traits associated with insect pollination. Breeding system experiments revealed that both C. scabromarginatum and C. coloratum require pollinators for seed production. Colchicum scabromarginatum is strictly self-incompatible, whereas C. coloratum is partially self-compatible. • Conclusions: Pollination by rodents occurs in two African Colchicum species. C. scabromarginatum appears to depend exclusively on rodents for seed production, while birds and autonomous selfing may contribute to seed production in C. coloratum. These are the first records of rodent pollination in the Colchicaceae. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

Jacaranda oxyphylla, whose flowers possess a conspicuous glandular staminode, is a zoophilous cerrado species. Here, the composition of the secretion of the glandular trichome and the influence of the staminode on the pollination biology and reproductive success of J. oxyphylla were studied. • Methods: The floral morphology, pollen viability, stigma receptivity, nectar volume and nectar concentration were studied. Compatibility system experiments were performed and floral visitors were observed and identified. Experiments comparing the effect of staminode presence and absence on pollen removal and pollen deposition efficiency were conducted in open-pollinated flowers. Histochemistry, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection (GC-FID) analyses were performed to determine the main chemical components of the staminode's glandular trichome secretion. • Key Results: Flower anthesis lasted 2 d and, despite the low frequency of flower visitation, pollination seemed to be effected mainly by medium-sized Eulaema nigrita and Bombus morio bees, by the small bee Exomalopsis fulvofasciata and occasionally by hummingbirds. Small bees belonging to the genera Ceratina, Augochlora and Trigona were frequent visitors, collecting pollen. Jacaranda oxyphylla is predominantly allogamous. Staminode removal resulted in fewer pollen grains deposited on stigmas but did not affect total pollen removal. The secretion of capitate glandular trichome occurs continually; the main chemical compounds detected histochemically were phenolic and terpenoid (essential oils and resins). Monoterpene cineole, pentacyclic triterpenes and steroids were identified by TLC and GC-FID. • Conclusions: The staminode of J. oxyphyllla is multifunctional and its importance for female reproductive success was attributed mainly to the secretion produced by capitate glandular trichomes. This secretion is involved in complex chemical interactions with pollinating bees, including the solitary bees Euglossini. These bees are common pollinators of various species of Jacaranda. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

In this study we confirmed the effective pollination of Isoplexis canariensis by opportunistic nectar-feeding birds in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. This plant is among the ornithophilous species of the Canarian flora that lack past and present specialist nectarivorous birds. Experimental hand pollinations revealed self-compatibility, but cross-pollinated flowers produced a greater percentage of viable seeds than self-pollinated ones. Flowers were visited by five species of birds (Phylloscopus canariensis, Parus caeruleus, Sylvia melanocephala, Serinus canarius, and Fringilla coelebs) and by the endemic lizard (Gallotia galloti, Lacertidae). Insect pollination was absent, and the few insect visitors acted as nectar thieves or secondary nectar robbers. Birds represented 93.1% of total visits, with the Canarian Chiffchaff, Ph. canariensis, being the most frequent visitor. Flowers visited by birds set more, larger, and heavier fruit than flowers from which birds were excluded. Bird visitation also enhanced seed viability. These results demonstrate the active role of these opportunistic birds as effective pollinators of this Canarian bird-flower species. Further, the results reveal the need to consider the effect of these birds on the evolution of ornithophilous floral traits in absence of specialist nectarivores.",Canary Islands; Generalization; Island ecology; Isoplexis; Opportunistic passerine pollinators; Ornithophily; Phylloscopus; Pollination effectiveness; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57349086022

We compared the invasive Senecio inaequidens to its native congener S. jacobaea in terms of interactions with pollinators. Visitor guild, visitation rate, and seed set were compared over 3 years in three sites in Belgium. Floral display (capitula number and arrangement) and phenology were quantified, and visiting insects were individually censused, i.e. number of visited capitula and time per visited capitulum. As expected from capitula resemblance, visitor guilds of both species were very similar (proportional similarity = 0.94). Senecio inaequidens was visited by 33 species, versus 36 for S. jacobaea. For both species, main visitors were Diptera, especially Syrphidae, and Hymenoptera. Visitation rate averaged 0.13 visitor per capitulum per 10 min for S. inaequidens against 0.08 for S. jacobaea. However, insects visited more capitula per plant on S. jacobaea, due to high capitula density (886 m-2 versus 206 m-2 for S. inaequidens), which is likely to increase self-pollen deposition considerably. Seed set of S. jacobaea was lower than that of S. inaequidens. We suggest that floral display is the major factor explaining the differences in insect visitation and seed set between the two Senecio species. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In monsoon-dominated East and Southeast Asia, there is a characteristic gradient in climate along latitude, creating a broad spectrum of forest types with potentially diverse pollinator communities. To detect a geographical pattern of plant - pollinator interactions, we investigated flowering phenology and pollinator assemblages in the least-studied forest type, i.e., tropical monsoon forest, in the Vientiane plain in Laos. Throughout the 5-year study, we observed 171 plant species blooming and detected flower visitors on 145 species. Flowering occurred throughout the year, although the number of flowering plant species peaked at the end of dry season. The dominant canopy trees, including Dipterocarpaceae, bloomed annually, in contrast to the supra-annual general flowering that occurs in Southeast Asian tropical rain forests. Among the 134 native plant species, 68 were pollinated by hymenopterans and others by lepidopterans, beetles, flies, or diverse insects. Among the observed bees, Xylocopa, megachilids, and honeybees mainly contributed to the pollination of canopy trees, whereas long-tongued Amegilla bees pollinated diverse perennials with long corolla tubes.

This knowledge is crucial for a more general evolutionary and ecological understanding of specialized plant-pollinator systems. In the present study, variations in pollinator activity, assemblage composition and pollen limitation were explored in the oil-producing species Nierembergia linariifolia (Solanaceae). • Methods: Pollen limitation in fruit and seed production was analysed by supplementary hand pollination in five wild populations. Pollinator activity and identity were recorded while carrying out supplementary pollination to assess the effect of pollinators on the degree of pollen limitation. In two populations, pollen limitation was discriminated into quantitative and qualitative components by comparing supplementation and hand cross-pollination in fruit set and seed set. The effect of flower number per plant on the number of flowers pollinated per visitor per visit to a plant was examined in one of these populations as a possible cause of low-quality pollination by increasing geitonogamy. • Results and Conclusions: Although pollen limitation was evident along time and space, differences in magnitude were detected among populations and years that were greatly explained by pollinator activity, which was significantly different across populations. Floral display size had a significant effect on the visitation rate per flower. Limitation by quality clearly affected one population presumably due to a high proportion of geitonogamous pollen. The great inter-population variation in plant-pollinator interaction (both in pollinator assemblages composition and pollinator activity) and fitness consequences, suggests that this system should be viewed as a mosaic of locally selective processes and locally specialized interactions. © The Author 2008.

Field studies of one of these species, Aloe inconspicua, revealed that it is effectively and exclusively pollinated by insects, especially females of Amegilla fallax (Apidae) that visit its flowers for nectar and pollen. The small (7.9 mm ± SD = 2.0) white flowers produce a standing nectar crop of 0.097 ± 0.10 ?l, much less than that of bird-pollinated aloes. Unlike other aloes studied to date, birds did not visit A. inconspicua, and bird exclusion had no effect on fruit or seed production. Visiting individuals of A. fallax typically contacted stigmas and anthers with their heads while accessing nectar, and single visits by them and a halictid bee resulted in seed set. Recent molecular evidence suggests that insect-pollination is the ancestral state for the Alooidea. If similar floral morphology indicates similar pollination systems, shifts from insect- to bird-pollination and possibly reversions back to insect pollination have occurred repeatedly within the ALOE clade. © 2008 SAAB.",Aloe; Alooideae; Amegilla fallax; Entomophily; Pollinator shifts,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-53049098307

We carried out a novel, retrospective, spatial analysis of the pollination of the entire population of two miniature orchids, Erycina crista-galli and Notylia barkeri, on coffee bushes in plantations at 900 m in Soconusco, south-eastern Mexico. The numbers of mature flowering plants of both species in the experimental site were similar. Notylia barkeri produced nearly four times as many flowers, but a similar proportion of the total number of flowers produced was pollinated (1.23% and 1.48% for N. barkeri and E. crista-galli, respectively). An estimated 29 919 977 (±4 983 995) seeds were produced by N. barkeri, nearly 12 times more than E. crista-galli at 1 009 414 (±147 000). The pollinators of N. barkeri chose flower clusters at random and pollinated various flowers within a patch, whereas the pollinators of E. crista-galli chose patches of flowers slightly more systematically, with less dependence on flower density, and appeared to dedicate less attention to each patch. For both species, pollinators slightly favoured larger clusters of flowers and left many individual and groups of flowers unvisited. To restore populations of these orchids in coffee plantations as a replacement habitat, N. barkeri should be planted in small, separate groups and E. crista-galli in larger groups of individuals, dispersed regularly throughout the selected site to maximize the possibility that the flowers will be discovered by pollinators. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Centris; Erycina crista-galli; Euglossa; Notylia barkeri; Orchid conservation; Trap-liner; Twig epiphyte,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55649097733

Soil water deficit results in ovary abortion because of low water potential (?w) resulting in inhibition of photosynthesis from anthesis to silking stage. Thus, drought is a key factor causing yield losses in maize, especially near the time of pollination. Earlier studies have indicated that selenium (Se) maintains antioxidative defence systems and enhances sugar and starch accumulation. The effects of Se on maize ovary development were studied in drought stress conditions. Maize ovary development was studied through observations on starch, membrane integrity, fresh weight and dry weight in drought-treated or unstressed glasshouse-grown plants, and crop yield, yield structure, leaf, stem and ear biomass accumulation were also analyzed. Results indicated that Se increased the stress tolerance of the crop, even though ovary abortion was not eliminated by Se treatments under low ?w. Under well-watered control conditions, Se had also negative effects. When the first ear was not succesfully pollinated or the ovaries aborted, the plants developed more ears.

However, high intergeneration correlations (IGCs) are required for effective EGT. This study is conducted to determine the effects of linkage and epistasis on IGCs. The covariance between genetic means of lines at early and late selfing generations with both linkage and epistasis is derived. Intergeneration correlations are calculated for different levels of coupling and repulsion linkages and for 10 nonepistatic and epistatic models. Intergeneration correlations are moderate to high in the presence of only additive and dominance effects at unlinked and nonepistatic loci but can be very low (<0.2) in tight repulsion linkages or some allelic and nonallelic effects. Epistasis may mimic or counteract the effects of linkage on changes in IGCs. Thus linkage or epistasis can be an important cause of low IGCs and such genetic causes cannot be changed through testing of more environments. This study points out the need to consider both genetic and nongenetic causes of low IGCs when evaluating the efficiency of EGT in self-pollinated species. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57149086072

Metabolic changes related to this phenomenon are less well understood in orchid flowers. Presently, two orchid species, Aerides multiflora Roxb. and Rhynchostylis retusa (L.) Bl., varying in their floral life span were evaluated for their postpollination- induced responses, involving the oxidative stress. The unpollinated flowers of A. multiflora stayed fresh for 17 days and attained senescence in 5 days after pollination (DAP), while those of R. retusa. remained fresh for 24 days and showed senescence in 7 DAP. After pollination, wilting began in 2 to 3 days in A. multiflora and 3 to 4 days in R. retusa. There was a higher electrolyte leakage accompanied by a concomitant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), indicators of oxidative damage in all the organs after pollination while ascorbic acid decreased significantly. The flowers of A. multiflora showed a greater electrolyte leakage, MDA and H2O2 contents as compared to those of R. retusa. Ascorbic acid content, on the other hand, was lower in A. multiflora than in R. retusa, suggesting a higher oxidative damage to the floral organs in the former species. An application of triiodobenzoic acid ( an auxin inhibitor; 0.25 mM) and silver nitrate (ethylene inhibitor; 0.25 mM) to pollinated flowers partially prevented the oxidative damage and consequently the senescence, suggesting the involvement of these hormones.

This study investigated the intra-accession diversity of 38 flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) genebank accessions preserved by Plant Gene Resources of Canada. Seven quantitative seed characters were studied: 1000 seed weight, seed oil concentration and fatty acid proportion of palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), linoleic acid (18:2) and ?-linolenic acid (18:3). Ten additional morphological characters of high heritability were also recorded. In 13 accessions the intra-accession diversity was assessed based on 4 years of observation of 7-12 pure lines selected randomly from the original accessions. From these 13 accessions, seven showed significant variation among the pure lines for all seven seed characters. In five accessions most seed characters showed significant variation and only in one accession the homogeneity of seed characters dominated. Variation was found in landraces, breeding material and cultivars. In 40 cases an attempt was made to identify pure lines within an accession that significantly exceeded the mean value of the original accession in a seed character, for which the original accession had shown high or low values. In 25 cases and for all seven seed characters such pure lines could be detected. In six cases, the most extreme performing pure lines were not from the same accession, that had the highest or lowest accession mean for the considered character. There was no association of morphological variation with variation of the quantitative seed characters. For genebanks, separation of mixed accessions based on obvious phenotypic diversity and in particular based on characters that create a selective pressure is probably the most efficient way to ensure preservation of a wide range of diversity at reasonable cost. For exploitation of diversity in breeding programmes, pure-lining is very useful. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Fatty acid; Germplasm characterization; Morphology; Phenotype; Plant breeding; Seed oil; Self-pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249097419

However, tolerance of the impacts of antagonists on pollination success is less well understood. Here, we extend the framework of tolerance to foliar damage to understand how plants mitigate the pollination and fitness costs of floral larceny (i.e., the consumption of floral nectar often without pollination). We focused on two mechanisms: high nectar rewards per flower to feed all floral visitors and high flower production to compensate for reproductive losses under reduced pollination and seed set. We compared the efficacy of these mechanisms in two plant species: Polemonium viscosum and Ipomopsis aggregata. In Polemonium, ants acting as larcenists reduce nectar accumulation but do not completely empty flowers. When nectar reserves were augmented, ant consumption increased, negating the efficacy of this putative tolerance mechanism. Similarly, in Ipomopsis, nectar addition had little effect on tolerance to larceny by bumble bees, perhaps because residual intact flowers do not have enough nectar to compensate for lost rewards. Flower production in both species mitigated some of the negative impacts of larceny on seed set. In Polemonium, flower number was not plastic in response to larceny, but large inflorescences enhanced female fitness only when larcenists were present, suggesting that ""surplus"" flowers in large inflorescences can function to replace reproductive losses due to larceny. In Ipomopsis, high rates of larceny induced flower production, but the fecundity benefits of making more flowers declined inversely to larcenist intensity. Overall, our results suggest (1) that tolerance to floral larceny involves ""banking"" extra flowers to replace lost reproduction rather than maintaining pollination of ones with larceny, and (2) that the efficacy of flower production as a tolerance mechanism varies inversely to larceny rate. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Compensation; Floral larceny; Ipomopsis aggregata; Nectar robbing; Plant-animal interactions; Polemonium viscosum; Pollination; Tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849205141

Understanding crop mating systems and their consequences for gene flow can aid in managing agricultural systems and conserving genetic resources. We evaluated the extent of pollen flow, its links with farming practices and its impact on the dynamics of diversity of sorghum in fields of Duupa farmers in Cameroon. Duupa farmers grow numerous landraces mixed in a field, a practice that favours extensive pollen flow. We estimated parameters of the mating system of five landraces representative of the genetic diversity cultivated in the study site, using a direct method based on progeny array. The multilocus outcrossing rate calculated from all progenies was 18% and ranged from 0 to 73% among progenies. Outcrossing rates varied greatly among landraces, from 5 to 40%. Our results also showed that individual maternal plants were usually pollinated by more than eight pollen donors, except for one landrace (three pollen donors). Although the biological traits of sorghum (inflorescence morphology, floral traits, phenology) and the spatial planting practices of Duupa farmers led to extensive pollen flow among landraces, selection exerted by farmers appears to be a key parameter affecting the fate of new genetic combinations from outcrossing events. Because both natural and human-mediated factors shape evolution in crop populations, understanding evolutionary processes and designing in situ conservation measures requires that biologists and anthropologists work together. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Cameroon; Conservation; Duupa; Gene flow; Mating system; Sorghum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54349100690

However, the relative performances of these methods have not been systematically evaluated and compared. In response to the strong need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance, global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes. We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks, trap nests with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used across a wide range of geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness (estimated from combined total samples). The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species, showed negligible collector bias, detected similar species as the transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they had a significant collector bias. The observation plots showed poor performance. As trap nests are restricted to cavity-nesting bee species, they had a naturally low sample coverage. However, both trap nest types detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other methods. For large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes with surveyors with different experience levels, we recommend pan traps as the most efficient, unbiased, and cost-effective method for sampling bee diversity. Trap nests with reed internodes could be used as a complementary sampling method to maximize the numbers of collected species. Transect walks are the principal method for detailed studies focusing on plant-pollinator associations. Moreover, they can be used in monitoring schemes after training the surveyors to standardize their collection skills. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE); Agricultural and seminatural habitats; Hymenoptera, Apiformes; Indicator method; Pan traps; Pollinator initiatives; Standardized monitoring schemes; Subunit-based rarefaction curve",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57549110240

In the present study, we investigated whether the possession of a sympetalous (fused) corolla and bilateral symmetry of flowers translate into decreased intra-specific variability as a result of natural stabilizing selection exerted by pollinators. Average size of the corolla and intra-specific variability were determined in two sets of southern Spanish entomophilous plant species. In the first set, taxa were paired by family to control for the effect of phylogeny (phylogenetically independent contrasts), whereas in the second set species were selected at random. Flower size data from a previous study (with different species) were also used to test the hypothesis that petal fusion contributes to decrease intra-specific variability. In the phylogenetically independent contrasts, floral symmetry was a significant correlate of intra-specific variation, with bilaterally symmetrical flowers showing more constancy than radially symmetrical flowers (i.e. unsophisticated from a functional perspective). As regards petal fusion, species with fused petals were on average more constant than choripetalous species, but the difference was not statistically significant. The reanalysis of data from a previous study yielded largely similar results, with a distinct effect of symmetry on variability, but no effect of petal fusion.

Factors such as resource limitation and certain floral traits may influence reproductive success in animal-pollinated plants. Correlated evolution of reproductive success vs. seven floral traits (inflorescence length, flower number, flower distribution along inflorescence, dorsal sepal length, lateral sepal length, flower color, and column position) was studied in eight species of Govenia. Taxa represented three lineages in the genus. Independent contrasts were calculated on a phylogeny inferred from chloroplast (trnL-F IGS) DNA sequences, and a correlation test and multiple regression were then performed. Two data sets were evaluated, one including all eight species and another excluding G. utriculata, which is autogamous. The historical analyses showed that there is a correlation between reproductive success and dorsal sepal length, column position, and flower number, these correlations suggest that changes in these floral traits usually accompany evolutionary shifts in reproductive success. Multiple regression tests suggest that changes in reproductive success can be explained by shifts in flower number, inflorescence length, column position and by dorsal sepal length. When phylogeny is taken into account, our analyses showed that evolutionary shifts in these floral traits were correlated with changes in reproductive success. Evolutionary correlation between reproductive success and floral traits might be explained by the natural selection of certain floral phenotypes by pollinators. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Correlated evolution; Floral traits; Flower display; Govenia; Independent contrasts; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52649167706

In the context of genetically modified (GM) crops in conventional agricultural systems, strategies based on spatial separation are promoted to reduce functional connectivity between GM and non-GM crop fields. Field experiments as well as simulation studies have stressed the dependence of maize gene flow on distances between source and receptor fields and on their spatial configuration. However, the influence of whole landscape patterns is still poorly understood. Spatially explicit models, such as MAPOD-maize, are thus useful tools to address this question. In this paper we developed a methodological approach to investigate the sensitivity of cross-pollination rates among GM and non-GM maize in a landscape simulated with MAPOD-maize. The influence of landscape pattern on model output was studied at the landscape and field scales, including interactions with other model inputs such as cultivar characteristics and wind conditions. At the landscape scale, maize configuration (proportion of and spatial arrangement in a given field pattern) was shown to be an important factor influencing cross-pollination rate between GM and non-GM maize whereas the effect of the field pattern itself was lower. At the field scale, distance to the nearest GM maize field was confirmed as a predominant factor explaining cross-pollination rate. The metrics describing the pattern of GM maize in the area surrounding selected non-GM maize fields appeared as pertinent complementary variables. In contrast, field geometry and field pattern resulted in little additional information at this scale. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cross-pollination; Global sensitivity analysis; Landscape metrics; Multi-scale analysis; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54349121511

México, CP 54090, Mexico","• Background and Aims: While parthenocarpy (meaning the production of fruits without seeds) may limit fecundity in many plants, its function is not clear; it has been proposed, however, that it might be associated with a strategy to avoid seed predation. Bursera morelensis is a dioecious endemic plant that produces fruits with and without seeds, and its fruits are parasitized by insects. Its reproductive system is not well described and no published evidence of parthenocarpy exists for the species. The purpose of this work was to describe the breeding system of B. morelensis and its relationship to seed predation by insects. • Methods: The breeding system was described using pollination experiments, verifying the presence of parthenocarpic fruits and apomictic seeds. Reproductive structures from flower buds to mature fruits were quantified. For fruits, an anatomical and histological characterization was made. The number of fruits in which seeds had been predated by insects was correlated with parthenocarpic fruit production. • Key Results: The major abortion of reproductive structures occurred during fruit set. The results discard the formation of apomictic seeds. Flowers that were not pollinated formed parthenocarpic fruits and these could be distinguished during early developmental stages. In parthenocarpic fruits in the first stages of development, an unusual spread of internal walls of the ovary occurred invading the locule and preventing ovule development. Unlike fruits with seeds, parthenocarpic fruits do not have calcium oxalate crystals in the ovary wall. Both fruit types can be separated in the field at fruit maturity by the presence of dehiscence, complete in seeded and partial in parthenocarpic fruits. Trees with more parthenocarpic fruits had more parasitized fruits. • Conclusions: This is the first time the anatomy of parthenocarpic fruits in Burseraceae has been described. Parthenocarpic fruits in B. morelensis might function as a deceit strategy for insect seed predators as they are unprotected both chemically and mechanically by the absence of calcium oxalate crystals. © The Author 2008.

Generally, the predicted level of gene flow was found to depend on the visiting bee species and the spatial arrangement of the red clover fields. When the fields are close to each other, the gene flow depends mainly on the typical foraging distance of the visiting bee species, but when the fields are far apart, the gene flow between red clover fields is more sensitive to the distances between red clover fields than to the actual bumblebee species that pollinates the fields. Using the suggested methodology, the gene flow may be predicted in different agricultural scenarios. For example, if the gene flow between red clover fields is mediated by Bombus terrestris and the red clover fields that were assumed to be quadrates with sides of 100 m are separated by 200 m, then the median gene flow is predicted to be 0.17%. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bombus terrestris; Coexistence; Gene flow; GMO; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54349105725

To test this hypothesis, we examined the visitation frequency and behavior of native and alien bumble bee species and resultant seed production in Corydalis ambigua, a native plant in Hokkaido, Japan. This species is self-incompatible: the flower has a spur and requires visitation by bumble bees for effective seed production. We compared visitation frequency as well as fruit and seed set after cross- and open pollination at five sites of C. ambigua. Four of these sites occurred near a residential district and included naturalized populations of B. terrestris, and the fifth site was located in a forested habitat with no B. terrestris. The native species B. arclens and B. hypocrita and the alien B. terrestris frequently visited C. ambigua. Bombus ardens legitimately consumed nectar, whereas B. hypocrita and B. terrestris rob nectar by perforating spurs. The legitimate pollinator B. ardens produced fruits and seeds more efficiently than the nectar robbers. At three sites, the proportion of robbed flowers per inflorescence gradually increased through the flowering period, which may be caused by the intrusion of alien B. terrestris into the native plant-pollinator interactions. At these sites, C. ambigua suffered from pollen limitation, as seed production from open pollination was lower than from cross-pollination, despite the fact that the total abundance of three bumble bees was higher than in the other two sites. Legitimate B. ardens visited fewer flowers within inflorescences with more robbed flowers, suggesting that nectar robbing may reduce the frequency of visitations by B. ardens within inflorescences, and resulting in decreased fruit set. Furthermore, reduced seed set implies a reduction in the pollination quality by B. ardens, probably due to decreases in visiting time per flower. Thus, introduction of alien B. terrestris may alter the native plant-pollinator mutualism: C. ambigua could establish a novel pollination relationship with B. terrestris because of its nonzero pollination efficiency, similar to the native robber B. hypocrita. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Bombus terrestris; Competition; Corydalis ambigua; Fruit set; Invasive alien pollinator; Native plants; Pollen limitation; Seed set; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849209902

Distyly is suggested as one of the routes leading to the evolution of separate sexes in plants. In this evolutionary pathway, pollinators may disrupt the complementarity of pollen transfer between morphs. Consequently, the floral morphs gradually specialize as either male or female. A key process required for gender specialization in distylous plants is a deviation of the realized functional gender (i.e. the proportion of genes transmitted to the next generation via pollen donation and seed production) from the potential functional gender (i.e. the expected contribution of male and female function to reproductive success from the number of ovules or pollen grains produced by each morph). I selected the distylous herb Arcytophyllum lavarum (Rubiaceae) to determine if asymmetry in pollen flow promotes differences in seed production, pollen donation and a discrepancy between the potential and the realized functional genders in pin and thrum floral morphs. Pollen flow in A. lavarum is asymmetric and the pin morph is more efficient at performing cross-pollination than the thrum morph. Conversely, the thrum morph produced two times more seeds than the pin morph. Male and female contributions to the potential functional gender were equivalent in both morphs. However, the pin morph transmitted more genes through pollen donation and the thrum morph more through seed production than expected from their potential functional genders. These results support the hypothesis that if pollinators consistently promote asymmetric pollen flow between morphs over generations, it is possible that gender specialization may evolve to the extreme of dioecism from an original distylous condition. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Distyly; Evolution of sex; Gender specialization; Páramo; Pollen flow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52549100181

Previous theories predict that long-lived plants will show a negative correlation between inbreeding depression and the level of inbreeding (as determined by an inbreeding coefficient) at maturity, but the extent of this correlation may vary among life stages because of variation in the genetic basis for inbreeding depression at different stages. To test this prediction, I used electrophoretic allozyme analysis and pollination experiments to examine the fixation index (Fis) at maturity and inbreeding depression in the early and late life stages of two populations with different outcrossing rates of a highly self-fertilizing tree, Magnolia obovata. The magnitude of inbreeding depression for early survival (?e) in an outcrossing population (tm = 0.51; Fis = -0.015) was higher (?e = 0.97) than that in an inbreeding population (tm = 0.18; Fis = 0.15; ?e = 0.38). From these results, I estimated that both populations exhibited high inbreeding depression for late survival (?l) (0.94 in the outcrossing population and 0.93 in the inbreeding one) and lifetime survival (?t) (0.99 and 0.96, respectively). My results and previously published data demonstrate the predicted relationship between inbreeding depression and the level of inbreeding for early survival, but not for late survival. This suggests that there is a differential genetic basis for inbreeding depression at different life stages. The inbreeding depression for late survival appears to play a central role in the maintenance of reproductive traits that promote outcrossing in M. obovata. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Inbreeding; Inbreeding depression; Life stage; Long-lived plants; Purging of inbred load,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50949088139

Each weed species was weighted based on the number of reported linkages with each animal group. Four biodiversity indices based on these weights were constructed and applied to exploring the ecological consequences of long-term changes in weed populations in Finland. Data were used from weed surveys of Finnish spring cereal fields conducted in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. The relative importance of weed species varied according to animal groups. Annual weed species able to produce numerous seeds were important for the farmland birds and some perennial weed species were important for the pollinators. The highest number of linkages was established between weed species and phytophagous insects. The number of harmful pest species associated with broad-leaved weeds was low for all species. The general pattern of changes in values of indices over recent decades was similar: there was a marked decline in the values between the 1960s and the 1980s, and a slight increase between the 1980s and the 1990s. These changes were regarded as being a consequence of changes in the intensity of agricultural practices. The slowest recovery of the values was for pollinators. The results suggest that the ecological consequences of changes in the intensity of agriculture can be explored with the aid of a biodiversity indicator based on species interactions.

The present study focused on the effects of inflorescence size and phenology, and flower position within the inflorescence, in relation to fruit and seed production of the Mediterranean shrub Ononis fruticosa. Variability in fruit and seed production, seed weight and germination were estimated and modelled. Results confirmed that the most important predictors in seed production were inflorescence flowering time and flower position within the inflorescence. Thus, the number of mature seeds per fruit was higher in earlier inflorescences and in basal positions. On the other hand, predation was higher in fruits in basal positions. In fact, seed predation seemed to be the most important factor controlling final seed production. Models at the plant level suggested a negative incidence of geitonogamous pollination and resource limitation, which were also observed at the fruit level. This study confirmed the relevance of inflorescence effects on the reproductive output of O. fruticosa.

A total of 42 and 41 provenances, each represented by two to five open-pollinated families were evaluated at each site, respectively. Results indicate that red alder provenances responded differently to the environmental conditions of the two sites. At age 10, red alder provenances tended to perform better at sites near their origin. The results support earlier work that two breeding zones should be delineated with the boundary at approximately 52° N. One may expect an average of about 5% decrease in stem volume and 6% increase in mortality, respectively, for each degree of southward and northward transfer of seed sources from their origins. Individual, family, and within-family heritabilities for height, diameter, stem volume were moderately high (0.22-0.42), for the southern zone, implying good potential for genetic improvement. Heritabilities were somewhat lower (0.12-0.39) for the northern zone because of greater environmental heterogeneity of the test site. Selecting the top 20 unrelated individuals for seed orchard establishment would result in 29% and 23% gain in stem volume at a rotation age of 40 years in the southern and northern zones, respectively. Correlation between ranks of the predicted breeding values for height at different ages and stem volume at age 10 increased rapidly when plantation was young and became relatively stable after 6 years of out-planting. Stem volume had much stronger correlation with diameter (?0.84) than with height (?0.67). Early selection at age 6 based on stem volume is therefore recommended. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Breeding zone delineation; Early selection; Genetic parameters; Individual breeding values; Open-pollinated provenance-progeny tests; Seed orchard establishment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52549112122

Yucca moths actively pollinate yucca flowers, and their larvae feed on a portion of the seeds. I used a manipulative field experiment to examine the hypothesis that the characteristic feeding behavior of the florivorous beetle Hymenorus densits may increase mortality of pollinator moth eggs and reduce the costs incurred by the plant. The results indicated that H. densus consumes moth eggs and that the consumption rate matches levels of moth mortality typically observed in these populations. On average, beetles consumed 1-2 eggs per flower, which translates into an increase in seed production of -16-32% per fruit. Counterintuitively, these results suggest that florivores can limit moth populations and reduce the costs incurred by the plant. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Beetle; Community context; Florivory; Hymenorus; Multi-species interaction; Obligate pollination mutualism; Tegeticula Cassandra; Yucca; Yucca filamentosa; Yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849196263

At the core of this hotspot, across the Strait of Gibraltar, lies a smaller region whose singular Cenozoic history and ecological features have created a distinct, nested sub-hotspot. In particular, an important relict flora, a high endemism, and the dominance of vegetation types other than the paradigmatic Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous forests and shrublands, are biogeographical features of paramount relevance. These singular environments may have provided suitable mesic habitats for stable human populations in this region throughout the Quaternary. Here we explore the possible causes of the unique biodiversity of this region. First, we show that endemism is associated with poor soils and mild Mediterranean climate, whereas relictness is primarily associated with riparian and humid habitats which might have remained relatively stable since the Late Tertiary. We then review and provide new results on lineage and molecular diversity of some taxa based on their evolutionary relationships inferred from phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses. These indicate that long-lived plants, such as trees, tend to show some discontinuity in effective gene flow, in comparison with short-lived and pioneer plants. Colonization abilities rather than dispersal vectors appear to be a crucial factor. We also analyze the role of microevolutionary processes that generate plant biodiversity in terms of reproductive features involved in lineage formation, such as breeding system, pollination biology and postdispersal regeneration. The few available studies show that this region is prone to changes in reproductive systems, associated with both abiotic and biotic conditions in the new habitats that plants face during colonization. Dispersal and regeneration ecology is especially important for relict species, as most of these species face some biotic (e.g., lack of dispersers, predation) and abiotic (edaphic and/or microclimate requirements) limitations to their recruitment. Nevertheless current limitations in the recruitment of relict plant species should not obscure the fact that they have been resilient in the face of Plio-Pleistocene climate changes in the Gibraltar region, whereas they became extinct in other Mediterranean areas. The relatively stable and mild climate of this region may have provided a suitable long-term environment for many other organisms, including humans. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The duration of the meiosis stage was more than 6 months, and included a long diffuse stage during winter. This long duration of the diffuse appearance of the diplotene stage makes L. leptolepis a unique suitable experimental material for studying the structure and function of the diffuse stage of meiosis. In particular, the processes of desynapsing and unpairing, which so far have received little attention, can be examined in detail. In L. leptolepis, the chromosomes undergo a dramatic structural reorganization during the diffuse diplotene stage. Based on the clearly visible differences in chromosome morphology, the diffuse diplotene stage was divided into four periods with suggested nomenclature as follows: schizonema, pre-diffuse diplotene, diffuse diplotene and post-diffuse diplotene. Both simultaneous and successive microsporogenesis were observed within L. leptolepis, and there was no strict relationship between the microsporogenesis types and the tetrad configurations, which are strongly influenced by spindle orientation, especially during meiosis II. The mature pollen grain at pollination consists of five cells aligned in an axial row.

Two breeding systems are commonly employed, self-incompatibility (SI) and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Sibs, assumed to be self-inbred, often contaminate hybrid seed lots in the SI system and whilst self-inbreeding is not possible in the CMS system, plants that look like sibs occur. The objective of this study was to develop microsatellite markers for male and female cauliflower parent lines of both SI and CMS systems and to use them to screen sibs and aberrant plants in F1 hybrids. Fifty six pairs of microsatellite primers were screened and 8 primer pairs produced co-dominant markers in parent plants and two pairs of markers were chosen for purity testing of F1 hybrid seeds. Controlled pollinations were conducted in the glasshouse to produce hybrid and selfed-seeds. These seeds were grown in a field trial to identify morphologically normal and sib plants and to assess the reliability of microsatellite markers in detecting sib plants. Microsatellite analysis of morphological sib plants from the SI system revealed that these were not always self-inbred, in contrast, most self-inbred plants showed normal growth. Similarly, all morphological sibs from the CMS system showed hybrid bands. This suggests that morphological sibs were not always due to selfing but possibly to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors and this requires further investigation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Cytoplasmic male sterility; Self-inbred; Self-incompatibility; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249134997

The re-analysis covered the period from 1994 to 2005 and was focused on suspected long-range transport events that were recorded both in Moscow and at several Finnish sites. In order to trace the origin of airborne pollen before the onset of local pollination, we used both aerobiological and phenological observations combined with forward and adjoint (inverse) dispersion model simulations. It is shown that, although the Moscow region is surrounded by extensive birch forests, it still receives substantial amounts of foreign pollen before local pollination. In the Moscow region, the sources of long-range-transported pollen are in the south and south-west, sometimes even in the east. In Finland, there are frequently cases, before the local flowering season, in which Finnish territory receives Russian pollen; however in the opposite direction, from Finland to the Moscow region, no transport episodes were unequivocally registered. Analysis of the end of the seasons was more problematic, due to contributions to pollen observations from local sources; this results in difficulties in the reliable identification of the long-range transport episodes. Apart from its short-term effects on the pollen seasons, long-range transport can have substantial impacts on the exchange of genetic material within Europe. A quick atmospheric pathway for gene transport can be important for adaptation of plants to a changing climate. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Atmospheric transport; Betula; Footprint; Gene flow; Inverse simulations; Pollen transport,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55349139028

A pair of chromosome 7A of common wheat were found to be replaced by a pair of telocentric chromosome 7Lr#1S, and further investigation showed that chromosome configuration of the substitution line at MI of PMCs after GISH was 17.50 [Figure not available: see fulltext.]W + 2.19 [Figure not available: see fulltext.]W + 0.42 [Figure not available: see fulltext.] 7Lr#1S + 1.08 I7Lr#1S + 0.69 IW. Two telocentric chromosomes paired as a bivalent in 59.7% of PMCs. Abnormal chromosome behaviors of telocentric chromosomes were observed in part of PMCs at anaphase I and telophase I, including the moving of two telocentric chromosomes to the same pole, lagging and earlier separation of their sister chromatid. All these abnormal behaviors can be grouped into three distinct types of tetrads according to different numbers of 7Lr#1S in their daughter cells and various micronucleus in some tetrads. However, due to the high transmission frequency of the female and male gametes with a 7Lr#1S, 84% of the selfcrossing progeny plants had ditelosomic substitution. The substitution line showed high resistance to wheat scab in a successive two-year test both in the greenhouse and field; hence, the line will be particularly valuable for alien gene mapping, small fragment translocation induction and telosomic cytological behavior analysis. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",Leymus racemosus; Meiotic behavior analysis; Scab resistance; Telosomic substitution line; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56349117125

In this study, plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis from open-pollinated immature zygotic embryos of nine genotypes of elite trees was established. Immature zygotic embryos were cultured onto RJW medium modified from 505 medium with 21.48 ?M NAA, 2.22 ?M BA, and 2.32 ?M KT. The average frequency for all nine genotypes was 74.2%. Embryogenic calluses of the nine genotypes of elite trees were subcultured on RJW basal medium containing 8.06 ?M NAA, 1.11 ?M BA, and 1.16 ?M kinetin. The calluses of three lines, 3#, 9#, and 2#, were actively proliferated but others were not. Somatic embryogenesis was induced from the embryogenic callus in genotypes of 3#, 9#, and 2# on RJW medium with ABA and 60 g l-1 sucrose. Cotyledonary somatic embryos were subjected to a drying process. The drying of embryos by uncapping the culture bottle for 5 days on a clean bench resulted in a high frequency of germination of somatic embryos (87% in RJW medium). However, plantlet conversion from germinated embryos was greatly reduced and the optimal medium for plant conversion was 1/2 WPM or 1/2 BMI medium. In conclusion, we have, for the first time, established a plant regeneration system via somatic embryogenesis in the Korean spruce, which can be applied for rapid micropropagation of elite trees. © 2008 Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer.",Genotype; Immature zygotic embryo; Picea koraiensis Nakai; Somatic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949110229

Because of the cardinal role played by the nucleus in gene expression and regulation, we have characterized the nuclear proteome of Medicago truncatula at the 12 days after pollination (dap) stage that marks the switch towards seed filling. Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of nuclear protein bands excised from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE identified 179 polypeptides (143 different proteins), providing an insight into the complexity and distinctive feature of the seed nuclear proteome and highlighting new plant nuclear proteins with possible roles in the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits (PESCADILLO-like) or nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (dynamin-like GTPase). The results revealed that nuclei of 12-dap seeds store a pool of ribosomal proteins in preparation for intense protein synthesis activity, occurring subsequently during seed filling. Diverse proteins of the molecular machinery leading to the synthesis of ribosomal subunits were identified along with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing or transport. Some had already been shown to play a role during the early stages of seed formation whereas for others the findings are novel (e.g. the DIP2 and ES43 transcriptional regulators or the RNA silencing-related ARGONAUTE proteins). This study also revealed the presence of chromatin-modifying enzymes and RNA interference proteins that have roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation and may be involved in modifying genome architecture and accessibility during seed filling and maturation. © 2008 INRA.",M. truncatula; Nuclear proteome; Seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54449100342

Table Mountain is a significant mountain in a global biodiversity hotspot, the Cape Floristic Region. It has outstanding angiosperm diversity and endemism. Yet, aerial and foliage invertebrates in the area have been poorly studied, despite their importance as pollinators and predators. These plant and invertebrate assemblages are under great pressure from human disturbance. Aerial and foliage invertebrates were sampled with a range of techniques. Sites were chosen to make comparisons between vegetation structure and type, elevation and aspect. In total, 216 species from 63 families and 14 orders were recorded. Vegetation structure (fynbos or forest) and elevation were the most important environmental variables for both aerial and foliage invertebrates. Peak time for aerial invertebrate abundance was spring and summer in the fynbos and spring in the forests, while the foliage invertebrates showed very little seasonal variation. There was no correlation between the diversity of aerial and foliage invertebrates. When these results were compared with others on epigaeic invertebrates, it became clear that epigaeic and aerial invertebrates are not correlated, while epigaeic and foliage invertebrates were only partially correlated, but not sufficiently so to consider one as a reliable estimator of the other. The management pointer from this study is that sites at all elevations are vital for the conservation of biodiversity on Table Mountain. Both the aerial and epigaeic/foliage invertebrate assemblages will need to be monitored separately to maintain the mountain's conservation status. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Arthropods; Biodiversity conservation; Cape Floristic Region; Flying invertebrates; Foliage invertebrates; Global diversity hotspot; Invertebrates; Monitoring; Mountains; Table Mountain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53549108577

These involved covering limbs with mesh bags before flowering occurred, emasculating and withholding pollen from flowers, or emasculating and self-pollinating flowers, then assessing the seediness of the fruit that developed along with similar fruit from open-pollinated flowers. Hybrids segregated for parthenocarpic ability in a ratio of 9:23 (x2 = 0.0008; ns), which favoured non-parthenocarpic hybrids and suggested the action of three dominant complementary genes. Variability in self-pollen reactions at the stigma indicated that the hybrids segregated for viable and non-functional pollen. Seedless fruit from self-pollinated flowers also suggested that the hybrids segregated for self-incompatibility. Variation between hybrids for floral characteristics concerning the presentation and availability of pollen in flowers, for which transgressive segregation was evident, was assessed in terms of the potential for self-pollination without vector intervention (auto-pollination), and the expression of parthenocarpy.The results are discussed in the context of selecting for parthenocarpy, coupled with pollen sterility or self-incompatibility in breeding new seedless Citrus cultivars.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953398205

Subaqueous transport may be a significant dispersal and migration mechanism of non-buoyant seeds of aquatic and riparian plants, and also secondary transport of seeds once they have lost buoyancy, but the efficiency of this difficult to observe process is largely unexamined. This study uses hydraulic modelling to establish the discharges that move the non-buoyant seeds of Hymenocallis coronaria as bedload or suspended load; uses stream gauge data to examine the frequency of effective discharges from late June to late September, the seed maturation and germination period; and the potential transport distance of the seeds. 2. The results show that the majority of non-buoyant seeds of H. coronaria can be transported as bedload through entire modelled stream reaches of lengths 10.8, 18 and 14.4 km with the 0.5 year return interval flow. Bedload apparently has the ability to move seeds over great distances, and may be a substantial factor determining the genetic structure, demography and dynamics of populations and communities. However, prolonged movement of non-buoyant seeds in suspension appears to be quite rare. 3. Although insect mediated pollination and biochory occur concurrently with bedload transport, bedload transport alone may be sufficient to account for the established gene flow rate of H. coronaria. The potential transport distance of many of the seeds exceed that between populations, and migration may occur more frequently than the species' generation time. 4. This is the first known study to use open-channel hydraulic modelling and sediment transport analysis to determine the effectiveness of non-buoyant seed transport. This method of analysis shows promise for application in other contexts, and especially where flow management is a critical issue for maintenance of rare species. © 2008 The Authors.",Bedload transport; Hydraulic modelling; Macrophytes; Shoals spider-lily; Suspended load,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249117363

A strategy to reduce cross-pollination from GM to non-GM fields was evaluated, on the basis of reducing the flowering coincidence by sowing at separate times. The trial included narrow plots in which transgenic maize was sown before, simultaneously, and after adjacent non-GM maize. A three-week delay between GM and non-GM sowing dates resulted in flowering delays below 5 d for early sowings, but up to 10 to 15 d for late sowings. Cross-pollination was monitored by xenia effect and validated by real-time PCR. The combined effect of flowering delay and distance from the pollen source was evaluated. Cross-pollination dramatically decreased with distance between pollen source and receptor. Flowering delay interacted with distance to the pollen donor source and further reduced GM pollen flow in all cases. Thus, it acted as a regulatory factor. A flowering delay of 92.9 growing degree units (GDU) (7 d in our experimental conditions) was enough to reduce the adventitious presence of GM kernels in non-GM maize plots down to residual values.

The main competing hypotheses include dominance, overdominance, and epistasis. NC design III is an experimental design that has been used for estimating the average degree of dominance of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and also for studying heterosis. In this study, we first develop a multiple-interval mapping (MIM) model for design III that provides a platform to estimate the number, genomic positions, augmented additive and dominance effects, and epistatic interactions of QTL. The model can be used for parents with any generation of selfing. We apply the method to two data sets, one for maize and one for rice. Our results show that heterosis in maize is mainly due to dominant gene action, although overdominance of individual QTL could not completely be ruled out due to the mapping resolution and limitations of NC design III. For rice, the estimated QTL dominant effects could not explain the observed heterosis. There is evidence that additive X additive epistatic effects of QTL could be the main cause for the heterosis in rice. The difference in the genetic basis of heterosis seems to be related to open or self pollination of the two species.

Box 386, 6700 AJ Wageningen, Netherlands","Longiflorum and Asiatic lilies of the genus Lilium of the family Liliaceae are two important groups of modern lily cultivars. One of the main trends of lily breeding is to realize introgression between these groups. With cut style pollination and embryo rescue, distant hybrids between the two groups have been obtained. However, the F1 hybrids are highly sterile or some of them could produce a small number of 2n gametes, and their BC1 progenies are usually triploids. Dutch lily breeders have selected many cultivars from these BC1 progenies based on their variation. It is presumably suggested that such variation could be caused by intergenomic recombination and abnormal meiosis during gamete formation in F1 hybrids of Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) hybrids in Lilium. Therefore, the meiotic process of ten F1 LA hybrids was cytologically investigated using genomic in situ hybridization and traditional cytological methods in the present research. The results showed that: at metaphase I, the homoeologous chromosome pairing among different F1 hybrids ranged from 2.0 to 11.4 bivalents formed by homoeologous chromosomes per pollen mother cell (PMC), and very few multivalents, and even very few bivalents were formed by two chromosomes within one genome rather than homoeologous chromosomes in some PMCs; at anaphase I, all bivalents were disjoined and most univalents were divided. Both the disjoined bivalents (half-bivalents) and the divided univalents (sister chromatids) moved to the opposite poles, and then formed two groups of chromosomes; because the two resulting half-bivalents retained their axes in the cell undisturbed, many crossover types, including single crossovers, three strand double crossovers, four strand double crossovers, four strand triple crossovers, and four strand multiple crossovers between the non-sister chromatids in the tetrads of bivalents, were clearly inferred by analyzing the breakpoints on the disjoined bivalents. The present investigation not only explained the reason for sterility of the F1 LA hybrids and the variation of their BC1 progenies, but also provided a new method to analyze crossover types in other F1 interspecific hybrids as well. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.",2n gamete; abnormal meiosis; crossover; genomic in situ hybridization; Lilium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949107096

In pseudogamous apomicts, reproduction via single individuals requires self-pollination and consequently self-compatibility (SC) for production of viable seeds. SC and reproductive fitness have been studied in diploid and polyploid taxa of the Ranunculus auricomus complex via pollinator exclusion tests, assessment of seed set, and germination rates. Reproductive fitness of sexuals exceeds that of apomicts and of F1 hybrids but may fluctuate more strongly between years than is the case in apomicts. Diploid sexual taxa and also their F1 hybrids are completely self-incompatible (SI). Autopolyploid sexual cytotypes are also predominantly SI, which may have restricted their range expansion. The observed breakdown of SI in the rather widespread allohexaploid apomicts may be explained by initial partial SC inherited from semi-self-compatible ancestors and strong selection for SC genotypes. It is concluded that higher reproductive fitness of sexuals may help to maintain sexual populations when cross-pollination is available, whereas SC in apomicts may be advantageous in temporally and spatially unstable environments and also for colonization events. Results suggest that SC in connection with pseudogamous apomixis is an important factor for the observed distribution pattern of geographical parthenogenesis. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

These losses necessitated evaluation of the level of resistance in cucumber cultivars of mainly Polish breeding, cultivated in Eastern Europe, and initiation of a breeding programme for resistance to this disease. Screening for resistance was performed on 84 cucumber accessions under growth chamber conditions using a highly aggressive strain of P. syringae pv. lachrymans. Most of the screened accessions were either susceptible or displayed intermediate resistance. The screening resulted in the identification of five F1 hybrid cultivars moderately resistant to angular leaf spot. The identified F1 hybrids were self-pollinated up to the F4 generation.

Pollinators, specifically bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages. We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675 individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95% were native, 50% were solitary, and 93% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of specimens, eusocial (50% of specimens), native (97%), and polylectic (98%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and 19% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species (6% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or forest-associated species were absent.

Closely related taxa may be maintained as distinct species by a variety of reproductive isolating mechanisms. These include: inability to produce hybrid offspring, endogenous selection against hybrids in the form of genomic incompatibilities, and exogenous selection observable in genotype-by-environment interactions. To understand the relative importance of these three isolating mechanisms, we performed hand-pollination and reciprocal transplant experiments in a natural plant hybrid zone. 2. We measured reproductive isolation by making crosses between two parent species of Penstemon and naturally occurring hybrids. Inclusion of reciprocal hybrid crosses allowed us to determine whether fitness components differed depending on the identity of the mother. 3. Hybrid performance was evaluated in the greenhouse and in a reciprocal transplant experiment in the field. We measured fruit set, seed set, seed weight, time required for fruits to mature and seedling growth for potted plants. To test for exogenous isolation, we planted pure parents, reciprocal F1 hybrids and later generation hybrids in a reciprocal transplant experiment, and measured survival. 4. On average, interspecific crosses produced as many seeds as conspecific crosses. Hybrid performance was also equal to or greater than parents in all environments, including the greenhouse and all field gardens, indicating a lack of endogenous isolation. Parent species and reciprocal F 1 hybrids differed in many traits measured. In each field garden, the hybrid with the native cytoplasm had a higher survival rate, suggesting local adaptation to different elevations. 5. Synthesis. Exogenous factors that differ along elevational gradients can be more important than intrinsic genetic incompatibilities in determining the fitness of plant hybrids.

We hypothesized that artificial selection decreases genetic diversity in managed populations and influences differentiation of populations depending on the amount of gene flow. Nine wild, managed in situ and cultivated populations (264 individual plants) were studied through isozyme analysis (10 loci). Genetic variation of S. pruinosus is the highest reported in columnar cacti species (e.g. HT=0.592). Genetic variation in cultivated populations (Ho=0.611, He=0.588) was slightly higher than in wild (Ho=0.556, He=0.583) and managed in situ populations (Ho=0.536, He=0.578), but differences were not significant. Most of the genetic variation occurred within populations, with low differentiation and high gene flow among all populations (FST=0.064, NmFST=3.659 and NmGST=3.803 in average) associated to bat pollination, seed dispersal by birds and transportation of vegetative propagules by people. Genetic distances were not correlated with geographic distances and in most cases are lower between similarly managed populations. Managed in situ and cultivated populations are important reservoirs of genetic diversity of this species to be considered in conservation programs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

K. Fu is a rare species endemic to Southeast Asia. The development of the male reproductive structures with emphasis on microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis are described for the first time. Our results showed that T. yunnanensis exhibits several features that are very different from other species of Taxus, such as pollination occurring in the same year as pollen cone initiation; production of several forms of tetrads including isobilateral, T-shaped or tetrahedron; shorter duration of microsporogenesis; longer duration of microgametogenesis; and production of more microsporophylls per pollen cone suggesting faster growth rate. Reports on the details of male reproductive development in Taxus spp. have focused on the activities of generative nuclei, while the activities of the sterile and tube nuclei are rarely mentioned. This paper provides a few more details about the sterile and tube nuclei, particularly, their relative position during the division of the generative nucleus to form two sperm. Furthermore, as our knowledge of the phenology of Taxus is confined to species that grow on high latitude areas, this paper provides information on the phenology of Taxus in low latitude areas. Overall, this paper provides several new insights about pollen cone development, microsporogenesis, and microgametogenesis in Taxus. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Conifers; Microgametogenesis; Microsporogenesis; Reproductive biology; Sexual reproduction; Taxus yunnanensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56249084520

The most common South American lynx spiders, Peucetia flava and P. rubrolineata, live strictly associated with various plant species that have glandular trichomes. To understand more about these spider-plant relationships, we investigated the influence of the spiders on the fitness of a neotropical glandular shrub (Trichogoniopsis adenantha) and on the arthropod community structure on the plant. We also tested whether glandular hairs provided any benefit to the spiders. Spiders reduced the abundance of several species and guilds of herbivores on the leaves and inflorescences. Consequently, damage to the leaves, capitula, ovaries, corollas, and stigmas caused by leaf-mining and chewing insects, as well as endophagous insects, were strongly reduced in the presence of Peucetia spp. Although the spiders fed on flower visitors, their negative influence on ovary fertilization was only marginally nonsignificant (P = 0.065). Spiders on plants of Trichogoniopsis adenantha that fed on common fruit flies that had died before adhering to the glandular trichomes did not lose body mass. However, those living on plants without stalked glandular trichomes (Melissa officinalis) did not feed on dead flies and lost 13-20% of their biomass. These results indicate that Peucetia spiders are effective plant bodyguards and that when there is limited live prey they may feed on insect carcasses adhered to glandular trichomes. Since several spider species of the genus Peucetia live strictly associated with glandular trichome-bearing plants in neotropical, Neartic, Paleartic, and Afrotropical regions, this type of facultative mutualism involving Peucetia and glandular plants may be common worldwide. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Asteraceae; Cost/benefit analysis; Glandular trichomes; Mutualism; Neotropical rain forest, southeastern Brazil; Oxyopidae; Peucetia; Pollination; Scavenging behavior; Seed prédation; Top-down effects; Trichogoniopsis adenantha",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849343303

A number of genotypes resembled the S. tuberosum type in terms of stolon length and eye depth and produced tubers under long day conditions. Tuber yields were not as high as expected, probably due to lack of adaptation of the S. commersonii genome to the environmental conditions in southern Italy (on average 325 g•pt-1 and 285 g•pt -1 in 2003 and in 2004, respectively). Compared to 2004, in the summer of 2003, characterized by extremely high temperatures, hybrids gave a higher tuber yield than the S. tuberosum control, suggesting that in our environmental conditions the wild S. commersonii genome, rather than resulting in heterosis for tuber yield, provides better adaptation to harsh environments. Although aneuploidy has often been associated with reduced fertility, several hybrids were fertile in crosses with S. tuberosum when used as female parents. In particular, the average berry set and number of seeds per berry were 38.2% and 31.8%, respectively. Based on significant relationships between ploidy levels and all yield and fertility data measured, the presence of extra chromosome affected the parameters considered: tuber yield in 2003 and 2004, percentage of fruit set, number of seeds per berry and number of seeds per pollinated flower. Regression analysis also indicated that ""Residuals"" were significant for all parameters measured. Therefore, additional factors (e.g. the genetic makeup of hybrids) may be key to fertility and yield. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Endosperm balance number; Interspecific hybridization; Pentaploids; S. commersonii; Solanum tuberosum; Tuber traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249117533

Four main developmental periods were recognized, and standard embryological features such as basic type of anther wall formation, simultaneous cytokinesis of microsporemother cells, tetrahedrally arranged microspore tetrads, and two- to three-celled pollen grains. Polygonum type of embryo sac development, delayed fertilization, and free nuclear endosperm were observed in Q. schottkyana and confirmed to be plesiomorphic. In Q. schottkyana, the primary archesporial cell divided into megaspore mother cells without forming a primary parietal cell, a condition that may be derived in Fagaceae. Another possibly derived state observed at an early ovule stage was a pseudocrassinucellate nucellus, defined by ovule epidermis giving rise to the subdermal layer (parietal layer) and archesporial cells directly developing into megaspore mother cells. During seed development, the funiculus was sessile and attached to the middle of an extremely compressed placenta; thus the apical position of aborted ovules in Q. schottkyana can be attributed to the elongation of both the placenta and the funiculus. Comparative studies suggested that the large size of the style at pollination, a hemianatropous ovule, and a sessile funiculus are likely synapomorphies of the genus Quercus. The new data on Q. schottkyana confirm the hypothesis that evolutionary novelty in the development and anatomy of Quercus flowers is mostly found in terminal clades. Two autapomorphies, lateral position of the hilum and lateral originated primary vascular bundle in the seed coat, potentially distinguish subgenus Cyclobalanopsis from other species of Quercus. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Here we use mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics to quantify nearly 800 proteins during the 5- to 6-day larval developmental stage, tracking their expression profiles. Results: We report that honey bee larval growth is marked by an age-correlated increase of protein transporters and receptors, as well as protein nutrient stores, while opposite trends in protein translation activity and turnover were observed. Levels of the immunity factors prophenoloxidase and apismin are positively correlated with development, while others surprisingly were not significantly age-regulated, suggesting a molecular explanation for why bees are susceptible to major age-associated bee bacterial infections such as American Foulbrood or fungal diseases such as chalkbrood. Previously unreported findings include the reduction of antioxidant and G proteins in aging larvae. Conclusion: These data have allowed us to integrate disparate findings in previous studies to build a model of metabolism and maturity of the immune system during larval development.

Because a sizable proportion of the human diet depends directly or indirectly on animal pollination [5], the issue of how decreases in pollinator stocks could affect global crop production is of paramount importance [6-8]. Using the extensive FAO data set [9], we compared 45 year series (1961-2006) in yield, and total production and cultivated area of pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops [5]. We investigated temporal trends separately for the developed and developing world because differences in agricultural intensification, and socioeconomic and environmental conditions might affect yield and pollinators [10-13]. Since 1961, crop yield (Mt/ha) has increased consistently at average annual growth rates of ?1.5%. Temporal trends were similar between pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops in both the developed and developing world, thus not supporting the view that pollinator shortages are affecting crop yield at the global scale. We further report, however, that agriculture has become more pollinator dependent because of a disproportionate increase in the area cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops. If the trend toward favoring cultivation of pollinator-dependent crops continues, the need for the service provided by declining pollinators will greatly increase in the near future. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

While historical data on the occurrence of synanthropic species were obtained from floristic literature, that on recent occurrence were extracted from the Czech National Phytosociological Database. Species that were common in the past are still commona century later and rare species are becoming rarer. Almost a quarter of all synanthropic species recorded at the beginning of the last century are endangered species and 12 are now extinct in this country. Some trends in species composition and particular species attributes were found. While mean abundance of archaeophytes and native species decreased, mean abundance of neophytes increased in both vegetation types during the last century. The use of regression tree models revealed that the relative abundance of weed and ruderal species is related to their species attributes, i.e. Ellenberg indicator value, lifespan, life strategy, pollination mode, plant height and flowering period. The most abundant weed species have always been shade-tolerant, relatively small plants that are able to flower for a long time and require high levels of nutrients. The most abundant weed species changed from insect-pollinated to those without any specific pollination mode. A long flowering period is an important attribute of the most abundant ruderal species. There was no significant change in ecological preferences of ruderal species. Regarding the life strategy of these species, CR-strategists were the most abundant in 1908 but less common in 2005 and partly replaced by C-strategists.",Arable land; Archaeophytes; Czech Republic; Neophytes; Regression tree models; Ruderal vegetation; Weed vegetation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54349114285

The small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers are pollinated by ectothermic insects whose activity is mainly confined to infrequent spells of sunny weather. We tested the hypotheses that (1) the solar irradiance environment of individual D. laureola plants and distance to the nearest conspecific should influence their pollination success and (2) the effect of both site-specific features on pollination success should be sex-dependent given the difference between female and hermaphrodite flowers in conspicuousness and floral rewards. We estimated maternal pollination success (mean number of pollen tubes/pistil and proportion of unfertilized flowers), measured the distance to the nearest flowering conspecific, and evaluated the irradiance environment (percent of canopy cover) for individual D. laureola plants in 7 southeastern Spanish populations. On average, hermaphrodite flowers were pollinated more often and had more pollen tubes/pistil than females. Distance to the nearest conspecific affected individual pollination success negatively, but the effect was significant only for females. Furthermore, there existed a highly significant sex x cover interaction effect on pollination success. Among female individuals, the number of pollen tubes/pistil decreased and the proportion of unfertilized flowers increased from closed to more open sites, while hermaphrodites showed non-significant and opposite trends. The contrasting sign of the relationship between cover and pollination success for the 2 genders is expected to generate a fine-scale, within-habitat mosaic in the magnitude of the pollination advantage of hermaphrodite individuals, which would be greater in the more open, sunny locations where ectothermic pollinators should be more active.

Success of these plants is owed to several unique evolutionary adaptations that aid in reproduction: the flower, the closed carpel, double fertilization, and the ultimate products of fertilization, seeds enclosed in the fruit. Angiosperms exhibit a vast array of reproductive strategies, including both asexual and sexual, the latter of which includes both self-fertilization and cross-fertilization. Asexual reproduction and self-fertilization are important reproductive strategies in a variety of situations, such as when mates are scarce or when the environment remains relatively stable. However, reproductive strategies promoting cross-fertilization are critical to angiosperm success, since they contribute to the creation of genetically diverse populations, which increase the probability that at least one individual in a population will survive given changing environmental conditions. The evolution of several physical and genetic barriers to self-fertilization or fertilization among closely related individuals is thus widespread in angiosperms. A major genetic barrier to self-fertilization is self-incompatibility (SI), which allows female reproductive cells to discriminate between ""self"" and ""non-self"" pollen, and specifically reject self pollen. Evidence for the importance of SI in angiosperm evolution lies in the highly diverse set of mechanisms used by various angiosperm families for recognition of self pollen tube development and preventing self-fertilization. © UBC Press.",Plant reproductive barrier; Pollen-pistil interaction; Pollinatzon; S locus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54249151003

Coleus with trailing growth habit is desirable as it increases its utility for use in hanging baskets, mixed containers, and as ground cover. There is a lack of published information on the genetic mechanism controlling growth habit and the development of new trailing types with orange colors. Two commercial cultivars, ""Red Trailing Queen"" (RQ) with trailing habit and ""Sedona"" (S) with upright stature, were selfed and crossed (RQ × S) to produce self and F 1 populations. F2 populations were produced by selfing plants in the F1 population. For each population analyzed, growth habit was rated on a visual 1-5 phenotypic scale, where 1 = upright, 2 = semi-upright, 3 = prostrate, 4 = semitrailing, and 5 = trailing. Genotypes were assigned to each phenotype, assuming that upright was dominant to trailing. In this study, growth habit was observed to be controlled by a single gene (U) with additive effects, with upright growth habit designated with a UUUU genotype and trailing growth habit designated with a uuuu genotype. In addition, foliage color was rated on a visual 1-5 phenotypic scale, and purple foliage color was found to be dominant to yellow-orange color.

In this study, we examine an obligate pollination/seed predation mutualism between moths and yuccas and the balance of direct and indirect effects of ants, aphids, and cheater moths on this mutualism. Cheater moths (Tegeticula corruptrix) do not pollinate yuccas but oviposit into developing fruit, where their larvae consume yucca seeds. The overall effect of ants and aphids on yuccas was positive. Ants and aphids had no negative impact on the number of fruit retained per plant, and they had a positive effect on the average number of viable seeds per fruit. Yuccas with high ant and aphid densities had a 60% increase in viable, uneaten seeds. This increase in seed production was largely due to the negative interactions between ants and T. corruptrix. The reduction of cheater ovipositions saved yuccas almost 46 seeds per fruit, plus an additional 26 seeds from the reduction of cheater larvae. Aphids also had an additional indirect benefit, because ants were less likely to damage yucca fruit when aphids were present. This study shows that strong positive interactions, such as the aphid/ant mutualism on yuccas, can also generate strong indirect effects on another positive interaction, the yucca/yucca moth mutualism.",Ant protection; Behavioural indirect effects; Mutualism; Quantile regressions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54249106389

Whether floral volatiles play a role in reproduction of the dogwood remains unclear. Objectives of this study were to identify principal volatile chemicals emitted from dogwood flowers and to assess a temporal volatile emission profile and volatile consistency across four cultivars. Inflorescences with intact bracts and 5 cm flower pedicel were removed from dogwood trees and subjected to headspace volatile collection. Six principal volatile compounds were detected from the flowers of the cultiver 'World's Fair' with 3-formylpyridine as the most abundant constituent. Subsequent headspace analyses performed using inflorescences without bracts or floral pedicels alone indicated that 3-formylpyridine, E-?-ocimene, S-linalool, and ketoisophorone were mainly emitted from inflorescences. Experiments were also conducted to determine whether volatile emissions differed across time and between different cultivars of flowering dogwood. When volatile emission was analyzed for 48 h using 12 h light/dark cycles, the emission of several volatile compounds displayed diurnal patterns. Finally, whereas florets in inflorescences of four different dogwood cultivars emitted similar levels of the six principal floral volatile chemicals, 'Cherokee Brave' flowers alone yielded 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and germacrene-D.

In generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated selection on corolla shape is even more difficult. In this study, we explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (large bees, small bees and bee flies) discriminate between different corolla shapes when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow petals, whereas bee flies prefer flowers with rounded overlapping petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the populations where large or small bees are the most abundant pollinator groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without specialization. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Corolla shape evolution; Geometric morphometrics; Nectar; Pollen; Pollinator preference; Spatial variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749148454

Phenology from seed germination via vegetative growth to reproductive development was studied under glasshouse and nursery conditions. Seeds rapidly germinated on a mixture of nursery soil and cattle dung in a ratio of 3:1 filled in pots or on cultivated soil under nursery conditions as a prerequisite for vegetative and flowering phenological studies. Hypogeal germination characterizes the emergence of seedlings. Subsequent vegetative and flowering phenology between glass house and nursery field populations showed significant difference (p &lt;0.05) in terms of time, duration and yield. Glass house populations completed their phenophases (seasonally) (72.3 ± 1.03%) within 133 days (15 March to 20 July, 2006) being under controlled conditions while field-grown seedlings extended to 225 days (15 March to 30 November, 2006) after seed sowing. Rainy season was the cause for the continuous damage of apical shoots, and consequently stunted vegetative growth of field-grown seedlings. Plant size (? 95 cm in height), leaves number (33-38) and seasonal climate (cold season for field-grown populations) were found to be the most eliciting signals for the initiation of flowering buds. 100 ppm GA3 was the most effective for early flowering (that is, before 6 days) and production of higher number of flowers (32.6 ± 1.6%) compared to the control (22.5 ± 1.33%).

To investigate whether a subset of books would be appropriate for classroom instruction about a specific science topic (plant reproduction), a selection of children's books about plants was analysed to identify how plant reproduction was portrayed and whether the book could generate misconceptions about the topic. Three types of data were collected from 69 children's books: growth progression of the plant, textual passages describing reproduction, and descriptions of illustrations related to reproduction. These data were then sorted twice: once to identify coding categories for how plant reproduction was shown in the books, and a second time to identify potential misconceptions in the books. Most of the books showed plants progressing through a lifecycle that generated a fruit or seed. However, there were three categories of explanations for this process: no mechanism, implicit mechanism, and explicit mechanism. The analysis also identified five inaccuracies in the books that could support misconceptions about plant reproduction. Overall, students could learn from these books that plants make flowers that generate fruits or seeds, and that pollination or bees support this process. However, the gaps in the explanations of plant reproduction would require the teacher to supplement, or in some cases correct, the text. It is recommended that content experts analyse children's books in their area of specialty and provide teachers with recommendations about the use of the books in classrooms.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52649083248

This study experimentally examined the effects of population size and isolation on pollination, herbivory and reproductive success in the forest herb Phyteuma spicatum (Campanulaceae). In an experiment in which population size and isolation were manipulated using plants from the same origin, population size positively affected pollinator visitation, but did not alter the generally high levels of herbivory. As a result, seed production was higher in large populations. Conversely, plants originating from 14 natural populations of varying size and degree of isolation did not differ in reproductive success when grown in the same environment, suggesting similar attractiveness to pollinators and reproductive potential. The intensity of herbivory, however, was higher in progeny of small populations, at least in terms of the proportion of biomass removed. In both experiments, there were no effects of population isolation. The results suggest (1) that small population size decreases reproductive success via direct negative effects on plant-pollinator interactions, (2) that this pattern is not offset by herbivory, but (3) that herbivory enforces fragmentation effects on pollination by further reducing the number of flowering individuals and (4) that habitat fragmentation may influence plant fitness by affecting plant response to herbivory. The effects of habitat fragmentation on plant populations in present-day landscapes are thus complex, illustrating the need for more integrated studies in conservation biology that take into account both mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Most animal-pollinated flowering plants offer nectar as a reward for their pollinators. Some 20 000 species, however, offer only pollen and rely on pollen-foraging bees for pollination. This creates a dilemma since pollen grains contain the male gametes and should be protected from becoming bee food. Darwin was the first to hypothesize that a 'division-of-labour' among stamens could solve this dilemma, with some stamens providing pollen as food, others providing pollen for fertilization. This hypothesis can only be tested if pollen grains from the two sets of stamens can be distinguished and their fates determined to the point of attachment on the stigma. 2. We tested Darwin's hypothesis in Melastoma malabathricum (Melastomataceae), a pollen-only flower with conspicuously differentiated stamens, an inner set that is short and yellow and an outer set that is much longer and purple with small yellow spurs. Pollen release is through terminal anther pores. Taking advantage of different exine patterns on the pollen produced by the two sets of stamens, we carried out a series of experimental manipulations to compare pollinator foraging behaviour and pollen pathways from anthers to stigmas. 3. The results demonstrate that in spite of all 10 stamens being buzzed simultaneously by the carpenter bees that pollinate M. malabathricum, pollen from the purple 'fertilization' stamens is dramatically more likely to land on stigmas than pollen from the yellow 'feeding' stamens. Removal experiments showed that the yellow 'feeding' stamens also attracted pollinators from a distance. Flowers that had their anther pores plugged received fewer buzzing bouts per visit, indicating that bees assessed the amount of pollen received per bout. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in pollen loads on stigmas of flowers that had their anthers plugged and stigmas of controls, demonstrating the efficiency of vector-assisted cross-pollination and the lack of vector-assisted self-pollination. 4. The unexpectedly precise placement of pollen grains even with buzz pollination, with a large proportion of the grains deposited out of the bees' grooming reach, helps explain the evolutionary persistence of pollen as a reward in spite of the bees' ability to assess the amount of pollen received during foraging bouts. Together, these results strongly support Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis. © 2008 The Authors.",Bee foraging; Buzz pollination; Melastoma; Pollen dimorphism; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator attraction; Stamen dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52049100782

The intimacy and specificity of these interactions have led to the prediction that the plants and their pollinators may be prone to cospeciation driven by coevolution. Several studies have identified patterns of phylogenetic congruence that are consistent with this prediction, but it is difficult to determine the evolutionary process that underlies these patterns. Phylogenetic congruence might also be produced by extrinsic factors, such as a shared biogeographic history. We examine the biogeographic history of a putative case of codivergence in the obligate pollination mutualism between Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) and two sister species of pollinating yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) We employ molecular phylogenetic methods and coalescent-based approaches, in combination with relaxed-clock estimates of absolute rates of molecular evolution, to analyze multi-locus sequence data from more than 30 populations of Y. brevifolia and its pollinators. The results indicate that the moth species diverged significantly (p < 0.01) more recently than their corresponding host populations, suggesting that the apparent codivergence is not an artifact of a shared biogeographic history. © 2008 The Author(s).",Biogeography; Bouse Embayment; Coevolution; Cospeciation; IM; Pollination; Vicariance; Yucca; Yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53149083000

Despite the essential role of pollination in the maintenance of many rare plant species, conservation management plans rarely consider the service of pollination. 2. This study identifies the main pollinators of a rare English plant species, Trinia glauca (Apiaceae), and provides recommendations for its conservation. A community-level approach is used, whereby a visitation network is constructed to identify the direct and indirect links between T. glauca and other members of the plant-visitor community. 3. A field experiment that excluded the main visitor species from female T. glauca showed that ants were the main pollinators of T. glauca. The network revealed that over the field season, 33% of the ants' visits to flowers were to alien plants, with Cotoneaster horizontalis making a particularly high contribution (58%) during the T. glauca flowering period. 4. The removal of alien plants is a part of the conservation management of T. glauca, and we simulated the likely consequences of this form of habitat management on T. glauca pollination, any effects being mediated by shared pollinators. Although positive or neutral effects are possible, a negative effect is also possible, whereby the removal of alien plants leads to a crash in ant populations, potentially reducing pollinator visits to T. glauca by up to 85.2%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Conserving the pollinators of rare plants is essential if their conservation is to be sustainable in the long term. Our data indicate that T. glauca is pollinated by ants and demonstrate that ants can also feed on alien plants, particularly during the flowering season of this rare plant. We suggest that management measures involving the removal of alien plants should consider the possible negative impacts on rare plants through changes in pollinator populations. In this case, a staged removal is likely to prove the best conservation approach, allowing the pollinators' response to be assessed before any serious negative effects occur. © 2008 The Authors.",Alien plants; Conservation of rare plants; Food web as a predictive tool; Network; Pollination by ants; Rare plant; Trinia glauca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50649096342

In the spring of 1998 at one stand consisting of 64 marked trees, there was a period of 19 days when maximal pollen release in one species and stigma receptivity in the other occurred simultaneously, enabling interspecific gene flow in either direction. This happened in spite of an average time separation of 22 days between the two species, reflecting a considerable intraspecific variation in the timings of flowering. Flowering intensities (as estimated from male flower abundance) were high, but fruiting intensities were comparatively low. Shortly after pollination, considerable abortion of female flowers and early fruits was recorded. In 2000, the interspecific overlap of phenologies was drastically reduced due to a delay in cork oak flowering. On the other hand, the individual timings were repeatable for most trees, at least in holm oak. Two other mixed stands were subject of parallel studies, with similar results in all traits except for a less dramatic reduction in fruiting intensities. In spite of the high opportunity for cross-pollination in 1998, and given the lack of hybrids among the progenies from the subsequent fruiting season [Oliveira, P., Custódio, A.C., Branco, C., Reforço, I., Rodrigues, F., Varela, M.C., Meierrose, C., 2003.

Especially in grasslands, earthworms are among the most important detritivore animals functioning as ecosystem engineers, playing a key role in nutrient cycling and affecting plant nutrition and growth. The objectives of the present greenhouse experiment were to quantify the effects of earthworms on grass-legume competition in model grassland systems at two harvesting dates - simulating the widespread biannual mowing regime in Central European grasslands. The presence of earthworms increased the productivity of grasses and legumes after 6 weeks but only that of grasses after another 10 weeks. In mixed treatments, the presence of grasses and earthworms decreased legume shoot biomass, the amount of nitrogen (N) in shoot tissue and the number of legume flowerheads while the presence of legumes and earthworms increased the amount of N in grass shoots and the infestation of grasses with aphids. Analyses of 15N/14N ratios indicate that, compared to legumes, grasses more efficiently exploit soil mineral N and benefit from legume presence through reduced ""intra-functional group"" competition. In contrast to previous experiments, we found no evidence for N transfer from legumes to grasses. However, legume presence improved total herbage and N yield. Earthworms likely modulate the competition between grasses and legumes by increasing soil N uptake by plants and thereby increasing the competitive strength of grasses. Earthworms function as essential driving agents of grass-legume associations by (I) increasing grass yield, (II) increasing the amount of N in grass hay, (III) increasing the infestation rate of grasses with aphids, and (IV) potentially reducing the attractiveness of grass-legume associations to pollinators. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have performed a direct cost-benefit analysis of the selective advantage of selfing, particularly given a long-term perspective among populations or across several flowering seasons within population. This study examined the fertility consequences of autonomous selfing in Roscoea schneideriana (Zingiberaceae), a small perennial Himalayan ginger typically found in habitats at around 3000 m a.s.l. • Methods: The floral biology of R. schneideriana was studied in natural populations; the capacity for autonomous selfing was estimated using pollinator exclusion experiments; the timing of selfing was quantified by anther removal at different times during flowering; whether autonomous selfing increases seed production was tested by emasculating flowers; and the magnitude of inbreeding depression was estimated by comparing relative performance of progeny from self- and cross-pollinations. Pollinator observations were also conducted in the natural populations. • Key Results: The hooked stigmas of most flowers curl towards the anther and can contact pollen grains at an early stage of anthesis. Flowers with potential pollinators excluded set of as many seeds per fruit as hand-selfed and opened flowers. Autonomous selfing mostly occurs within 2 d of anthesis and can increase seed production by an average of 84 % in four populations during the flowering seasons of 2005-2007. Visits by effective pollinators were extremely rare. The cumulative inbreeding depression of R. schneideriana was 0.226. • Conclusions: Autonomous selfing in R. schneideriana is achieved by stigmas curling towards the anthers early in flowering. It is suggested that under the poor pollination conditions, autonomous selfing has been selected for in this alpine ginger because it provides substantial reproductive assurance with very low costs. © The Author 2008.

We introduce a general method using numerical simulations to test several alternative models of frequency-dependent selection on S-locus data from sporophytic systems, taking into account both genetic drift and observed patterns of dominance interactions among S-locus haplotypes (S-haplotypes). Using a molecular typing method, we estimated S-haplotype frequencies in a sample of 322 adult plants and of 245 offspring obtained from seeds sampled on 22 maternal plants, collected in a single population of Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae). We found eight different S-haplotypes and characterized their dominance interactions by controlled pollinations. We then compared the likelihood of different models of frequency-dependent selection: we found that the observed haplotype frequencies and observed frequency changes in one generation best fitted a model with (1) the observed dominance interactions and (2) no pollen limitation. Overall, our population genetic models of frequency-dependent selection, including patterns of dominance interactions among S-haplotypes and genetic drift, can reliably predict polymorphism at the S-locus. We discuss how these approaches allow detecting additional processes influencing the evolutionary dynamics of the S-locus, such as purifying selection on linked loci. © 2008 The Author(s).",Balancing selection; Mating system; S-locus; Sporophytic self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53149120643

Empirical estimates of the relative importance of different pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between recently diverged species are important for understanding speciation processes. While many bromeliad species easily hybridize in cultivation, few records of natural hybrids between closely related sympatric species suggest the existence of strong prezygotic barriers. A community of 42 sympatric bromeliad species, represented by nine genera (Aechmea, Billbergia, Edmundoa, Neoregelia, Nidularium, Quesnelia, Racinaea, Tillandsia, and Vriesea), were surveyed from 2004-2005 to assess the role of microhabitat isolation, phenological isolation and ethological isolation as potential prezygotic barriers. These bromeliads are abundant in the understory and frequently grow densely aggregated in multispecific patches that may facilitate promiscuous pollination. There was a large overlap of flowering periods even between congeneric species. Most species shared a similar assemblage of flower visitors; the hummingbird Rhamphodon naevius was the major visitor for 35 species. Only one putative hybrid was observed. This uncommonness of hybridization is puzzling, given that the prezygotic isolation mechanisms investigated are potentially weak to effectively avoid interspecific pollination. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Brazil; Bromeliaceae; Flowering phenology; Hummingbird; Hybridization; Reproductive isolation; Shared pollinators; Sympatry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249124662

In living conifers, saccate pollen occurs in taxa that combine erect ovulate cones at the time of pollination, inverted ovules, and pollination drops. Sacci function primarily to float pollen grains through a liquid pollination drop and concentrate them near the nucellus of the ovule. The morphology and anatomy of sacci are crucial to the proper operation of this pollination mechanism, and similar size proportions in fossil and modern saccate grains suggest that ancient pollen may have functioned in the same way as modern forms. Multivariate analysis of discrete pollen characters performed on data from in situ grains of several groups of fossil seed plants indicates that modern saccus morphology and structure appear as early as the Upper Carboniferous in some nonconiferous seed plants but later in the evolutionary history of the conifer lineage. Combined evidence from pollen morphology suggests that sacci may have functioned in their modern capacity by the Upper Carboniferous in at least some groups of seed plants, which is consistent with the occurrence of potentially inverted ovules in many extinct groups producing saccate pollen. This study also suggests that modern saccus morphology has evolved independently several times over the course of seed plant evolution. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

We examined the habitat and flower resource occupancy by the invasive introduced bumble bee Bombus terrestris and three dominant native bumble bees in central Hokkaido, northern Japan, in relation to a landscape factor (forest cover ratio) and flower morphology with respect to the proboscis length of bees. Three years of monitoring the invasive boundary of B. terrestris indicated that this species, which dominates open agricultural areas, probably will not invade the forests in which the native species dominate. This habitat partitioning likely followed the displacement of the natives by the invader in open agricultural lands. In forested areas, the native species partitioned flower resources on the basis of the relationship between proboscis length and the lengths of the corolla tubes of flowers. However, in open agricultural areas, both the long- and short-tubed flowers were primarily visited by the exotic short-tongued B. terrestris, which foraged illegitimately (by nectar robbing) on long-tubed flowers (Trifolium pratense L.) and legitimately on short-tubed flowers (T. repens L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). The invasion of B. terrestris into open natural vegetation, in addition to open agricultural areas, has recently been reported in Hokkaido. Even though the exotic and dominant native bumble bees partition their habitat according to landscape factors, the invasive bee has the potential to alter the overall interactions within plant-pollinator systems in the regions of open vegetation on Hokkaido Island. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We used two approaches to test for reinforcement in a species radiation of Neotropical gingers in the genus Costus. First, we conducted an intensive study of Costus pulverulentus and Costus scaber, two recently diverged species that co-occur and share hummingbird pollinators. The hummingbird pollinators transfer pollen between these Costus species, but hybrids are rarely found in nature. By performing pollinations between populations of C. pulverulentus and C. scaber from three sites across the species' geographic ranges, we find that pollen-pistil incompatibilities acting prior to fertilization have evolved only between locally sympatric populations, whereas geographically distant populations within the region of sympatry and allopatric populations remain fully interfertile. Second, we conducted a comparative study of isolating mechanisms across the genus. We find lower seed set due to pollen-pistil incompatibility between species pairs that co-occur and experience pollen transfer in nature compared to species pairs that are otherwise isolated, regardless of genetic distance. Taken together, these studies indicate that crossing barriers prevent potentially maladaptive hybridization and effectively reinforce the speciation process. Our results add to mounting evidence for reinforcement from animal studies and show that plant speciation may also involve complex mate recognition systems. Reinforcement may be particularly important in rapidly diverging lineages where ecological factors play a primary role in reproductive isolation, as may often be the case in tropical communities. © 2008 The Author(s).",Costus; Crossing barriers; Differential fusion; Pollen-pistil incompatibility; Pollination; Reinforcement; Reproductive character displacement; Tropical diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53149083001

With concerns of a global pollination crisis, there is a need for improving pollinator habitat. Roadsides restored to native prairie vegetation may provide valuable habitat to bees, the most important group of pollinators. Such roadsides support a variety of pollen and nectar sources and unlike agricultural fields, are unplowed, and therefore can provide potential nesting sites for ground-nesting bees. To examine potential effects of roadside restoration, bee communities were sampled via aerial netting and pan trapping along roadside prairie restorations as well as roadsides dominated by non-native plants. Management of roadside vegetation via the planting of native species profoundly affected bee communities. Restored roadsides supported significantly greater bee abundances as well as higher species richness compared to weedy roadsides. Floral species richness, floral abundance, and percentage of bare ground were the factors that led to greater bee abundance and bee species richness along restored roadsides. Traffic and width of roadside did not significantly influence bees, suggesting that even relatively narrow verges near heavy traffic could provide valuable habitat to bees. Restored and weedy roadside bee communities were similar to the prairie remnant, but the prairie remnant was more similar in bee richness and abundance to restored roadsides. Restoring additional roadsides to native vegetation could benefit pollinator conservation efforts by improving habitat on the millions of acres of land devoted to roadsides worldwide, land that is already set aside from further development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

By deterministically accounting for genotyping error and comparing a range of assignment methods, individual-based paternity assignments were used to derive population-level estimates of gene flow. Pollen immigration into a 300 ha landscape represents between 43 and 68% of effective pollination, mostly depending on assignment method. Individual male reproductive success is unequal, with 31 of 48 trees fertilizing one seed or more, but only three trees fertilizing more than ten seeds. Spatial analysis suggests a fat-tailed pollen dispersal curve with 85% of detected pollination occurring within 100 m, and 15% spreading between 300 and 1900 m from the source. Identification of immigrating pollen sourced from two neighbouring remnants indicates further effective dispersal at 2900 m. Pollen exchange among remnants is driven by population size rather than geographic distance, with larger remnants acting predominantly as pollen donors, and smaller remnants as pollen recipients. Enhanced wind dispersal of pollen in a barren landscape ensures that the seed produced within the catchment includes genetic material from a wide geographic area. However, gene flow estimates based on analysis of non-dispersed seeds were shown to underestimate realized gene immigration into the remnants by a factor of two suggesting that predictive landscape conservation requires integrated estimates of post-recruitment gene flow occurring via both pollen and seed. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Fraxinus excelsior L; Genetic connectivity; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape genetics; Microsatellites; Paternity assignment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52549102476

In plant breeding, their utilization lies in introgressing characters of agronomic value. The present investigation reports the production of intergeneric somatic hybrids Brassica napus (2n = 38) + Orychophragmus violaceus (2n = 24) through asymmetric fusions of mesophyll protoplasts and subsequent development of B. napus-O. violaceous chromosome addition lines. Somatic hybrids showed variations in morphology and fertility and were mixoploids (2n = 51-67) with a range of 19-28 O. violaceus chromosomes identified by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). After pollinated with B. napus parent and following embryo rescue, 20 BC1 plants were obtained from one hybrid. These exhibited typical serrated leaves of O. violaceus or B. napus-type leaves. All BC1 plants were partially male fertile but female sterile because of abnormal ovules. These were mixoploids (2n = 41-54) with 9-16 chromosomes from O. violaceus. BC2 plants showed segregations for female fertility, leaf shape and still some chromosome variation (2n = 39-43) with 2-5 O. violaceus chromosomes, but mainly containing the whole complement from B. napus. Among the selfed progenies of BC2 plants, monosomic addition lines (2n = 39, AACC + 1O) with or without the serrated leaves of O. violaceus or female sterility were established. The complete set of additions is expected from this investigation. In addition, O. violaceus plants at diploid and tetraploid levels with some variations in morphology and chromosome numbers were regenerated from the pretreated protoplasts by iodoacetate and UV-irradiation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH); Monosomic addition; Orychophragmus violaceus; Somatic hybrids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51749104415

Two methods to detect HEAR in low erucic acid oilseed rape (LEAR) were compared: real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and gas chromatography (GC). RESULTS: Fields (2.5 ha) of a LEAR variety (0.028% EA) in Tayside and Hertfordshire were juxtaposed adjacent to and 1 km distant from a HEAR (44% EA) field. The LEAR variety was a varietal association to ensure high cross-pollination (CP). The methods were highly correlated, measuring between 30% and 0.5% CP. However, the qPCR method became unreliable below 0.5% CP, whereas GC was robust enough to detect raised EA equivalent to one F1 seed in 500 (0.2%). A statistical mixture model was fitted to the distributions of EA in samples in order to assign a CP value to each 500-seed sample. Declines of CP from 30% to <1%, and EA from 5% to 0.2%, with distance up to 150 m in the near fields was best fitted with a power function. The combined mean EA for both far fields was 0.11%, well above the background LEAR value of 0.028%, and mean CP was 0.36%. CONCLUSIONS: The GC method of detection raised %EA should be a reliable and high-throughput means of estimating %CP between fields, provided the %EA of single F1 seed in receptor fields is measured to confirm the presence of F1 seed. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.",Cross-pollination; Erucic acid; Gas chromatography; Gene flow; Oilseed rape; Real-time qPCR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55449113504

Although recipient plants are unable to choose which pollen they receive, post-pollination selection (acting pre- or post-zygotically) may modify the outcome of pollination. Here we show that genetic variation among pollen recipients can predict the outcome of pollen competition (seed paternity) in the dioecious white campion. To investigate whether genetic variation among pollen recipients affects paternity, we applied the same pollen mixture from two males to three females, two of which full sisters and the third one chosen at random (unrelated). To control for maternal environmental effects, the plants used for these crosses were greenhouse-reared F1. We replicated this in two populations, for a total of 51 crosses, and genotyped a total of 772 offspring to assign paternity. If genetic variation affects paternity, we expected greater similarity of paternity success of the focal male with the sisters, compared to the unrelated female. Paternity of the focal male was significantly more repeatable over sisters, compared to repeatability over the mean of sisters and the unrelated females. When populations were analyzed separately, this was significant in one of the two populations. Paternity was not significantly correlated with stigma size. This provides evidence that in at least one population, genetic variation among individual plants influences the donors' paternity success, as assessed through genetic analysis of the seedling. Since due to gravity-dispersed seeds natural patches may often consist of related plants, the observed effect may contribute to variation in male reproductive success. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52049111356

Recently, nearly 30% of queens of the Japanese native species Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypocrita hypocrita were estimated to copulate with B. terrestris males in the field, suggesting that indigenous bumblebees could be genetically deteriorated through hybrid production with the introduced species. In this study, we evaluated hybrid production between the introduced B. terrestris and the indigenous B. hypocrita sapporoensis under laboratory conditions. The hatching rate of eggs derived from interspecific matings was 0% and 8.6% depending on the direction of the cross, which was significantly lower than that from intraspecific matings of B. terrestris (76.9%) and B. hypocrita sapporoensis (78.9%). Genetic studies using microsatellite markers revealed that both haploid and diploid individuals were present in the egg stage, whereas all hatched larvae were haploid. In addition, histological studies revealed that eggs derived from interspecific matings terminated development 2 days after oviposition. These results strongly suggested that eggs derived from interspecific matings are inviable due to post-mating isolation mechanisms.

Mathematical models: The resource budget of each tree is traced. Trees need outcross pollen to produce fruits, and trees within an entire forest exchange pollen with each other (global pollen coupling). The forest is composed of a number of sites. Each site can lose its trees, after which it becomes a gap, available for recruitment from seeds. Model analysis: We developed a new graphical method called the finite pairwise invasibility plot (fPIP), which shows whether a mutant phenotype has a fixation probability higher than the neutral case. We search for the evolutionary outcome in a finite population. Conclusion: In the absence of seed predators, trees will evolve masting only if it improves their pollination efficiency. In addition, (1) empty sites (gaps) need to remain empty over multiple years, and (2) pollen limitation must be severe in non-mast years. © 2008 Yoh Iwasa.",Finite pairwise invasibility plot; Games in finite population; Gap dynamics; Mast seeding; Masting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55949116081

These effects are likely to depend on population history. In a greenhouse experiment with plants from 17 populations of Lychnis flos-cuculi, we studied the effects of experimental inbreeding on resistance and plant fitness. Depending on the levels of past herbivory and abiotic factors at the site of plant origin, we found either inbreeding or outbreeding depression in herbivore resistance. Furthermore, when not damaged experimentally by snail herbivores, plants from populations with higher heterozygosity suffered from inbreeding depression and those from populations with lower heterozygosity suffered from outbreeding depression. These effects of inbreeding and outbreeding were not apparent under experimental snail herbivory. We conclude that inbreeding effects on resistance and plant fitness depend on population history. Moreover, herbivory can mask inbreeding effects on plant fitness. Thus, understanding inbreeding effects on plant fitness requires studying multiple populations and considering population history and biotic interactions. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Experimental inbreeding; Fitness; Herbivore resistance; Herbivory; Inbreeding depression; Outbreeding depression; Purging of genetic load,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249099958

VASO was intended to answer the needs of small farmers (e.g., yield, bread making quality, ability for polycropping systems). During 20 years of PMB at VASO, mass (MS) and S2 recurrent selection (S2RS) were applied on the maize landrace 'Pigarro'. Morphological (e.g., ear length and fasciation level) and yield evaluations were conducted in Portugal (2-3 locations in 2 years) and in USA (4 locations in one year) using samples from original population, six MS cycles and three S2RS cycles. North American Populations (BS21, BS22, TEPR-EC6) were also included as checks. ANOVA comparisons and regression analyses on the rate of direct response to selection were performed. Response to MS for Iowa showed significant decrease in stalk lodging, while in Portugal ear length significantly decreased, whereas ear diameter, kernel-row number, and fasciation level significantly increased. Selection also significantly increased days-to-silk and anthesis in Portugal. Response to S2RS in Portugal significantly increased days-to-silk, uniformity, and cob/ear weight ratio. These results showed that the methods used by farmer and breeder were not effective for significant yield increase, but the ear size increased significantly for MS and showed a positive tendency for S2RS.

To test whether selection has contributed to trait divergence, we compared differentiation at eight microsatellite loci (measured as F ST) to differentiation of quantitative floral and phenological traits (measured as QST) of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) across populations from three continents. We sampled eight populations: seven naturalized populations and one from its native range. By comparing estimates of QST and FST, we found that petal size was the only floral trait that may have diverged more than expected due to drift alone, but inflorescence height, flowering time, and rosette formation have greatly diverged between the native and nonnative populations. Our results suggest the loss of a rosette and the evolution of early flowering time may have been the key adaptations enabling wild radish to become a major agricultural weed. Floral adaptation to different pollinators does not seem to have been as necessary for the success of wild radish in new environments.

All species except two were found to be strict pollen specialists at the level of plant family or genus. These oligolectic species together exploit the flowers of eight different plant orders that are distributed among all major angiosperm lineages. Based on ancestral state reconstruction, we found that oligolecty is the ancestral state in Chelostoma and that the two pollen generalists evolved from oligolectic ancestors. The distinct pattern of host broadening in these two polylectic species, the highly conserved floral specializations within the different clades, the exploitation of unrelated hosts with a striking floral similarity as well as a recent report on larval performance on nonhost pollen in two Chelostoma species clearly suggest that floral host choice is physiologically or neurologically constrained in bees of the genus Chelostoma. Based on this finding, we propose a new hypothesis on the evolution of host range in bees. © 2008 The Author(s).",Ancestral state reconstruction; Evolutionary constraint; Oligolecty; Phylogeny; Pollination; Supermatrix,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54649083490

In this study a comparison has been made between the metabolite composition of individual flower organs of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) including the petal, sepal, stamen, pistil and the receptacle that gives rise to the strawberry fruit. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the semi-polar secondary metabolites by the use of UPLC-qTOF-MS was utilized in order to localize metabolites belonging to various chemical classes (e.g. ellagitannins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, terpenoids, and spermidine derivatives) to the different flower organs. The vast majority of the tentatively identified metabolites were ellagitannins that accumulated in all five parts of the flower. Several metabolite classes were detected predominantly in certain flower organs, as for example spermidine derivatives were present uniquely in the stamen and pistil, and the proanthocyanidins were almost exclusively detected in the receptacle and sepals. The latter organ was also rich in terpenoids (i.e. triterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid derivatives) whereas phenolic acids and flavonols were the predominant classes of compounds detected in the petals. Furthermore, we observed extensive variation in the accumulation of metabolites from the same class in a single organ, particularly in the case of ellagitannins, and the flavonols quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin. These results allude to spatially-restricted production of secondary metabolite classes and specialized derivatives in flowers that take part in implementing the unique program of individual organs in the floral life cycle. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These eusocial animals display temporal polyethism, which is an age-driven division of labor. Younger adult bees remain in the hive and tend to developing brood, while older adult bees forage for pollen and nectar to feed the colony. As honey bees mature, the types of pathogens they experience also change. As such, pathogen pressure may affect bees differently throughout their lifespan. We provide the first direct tests of honey bee innate immune strength across developmental stages. We investigated immune strength across four developmental stages: larvae, pupae, nurses (1-day-old adults), and foragers (22-30 days old adults). The immune strength of honey bees was quantified using standard immunocompetence assays: total hemocyte count, encapsulation response, fat body quantification, and phenoloxidase activity. Larvae and pupae had the highest total hemocyte counts, while there was no difference in encapsulation response between developmental stages. Nurses had more fat body mass than foragers, while phenoloxidase activity increased directly with honey bee development. Immune strength was most vigorous in older, foraging bees and weakest in young bees. Importantly, we found that adult honey bees do not abandon cellular immunocompetence as has recently been proposed. Induced shifts in behavioral roles may increase a colony's susceptibility to disease if nurses begin foraging activity prematurely. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We report that a novel Armadillo repeat protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, ARMADILLO REPEAT ONLY1 (ARO1), is of fundamental importance for polar growth and F-actin organization in tip-growing pollen tubes. ARO1 is specifically expressed in the vegetative cell of pollen as well as in the egg cell. ARO1-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) fusion proteins accumulate most notably in pollen tube tips and partially colocalize with F-actin in the shank of pollen tubes. ARO1 knockout results in a highly disorganized actin cytoskeleton, growth depolarization, and ultimately tube growth arrest. Tip-localized ARO1-GFP is spatially shifted toward the future site of tip growth, indicating a role of ARO1 in the signaling network controlling tip growth and regulating actin organization. After the pollen tube discharges its contents into the receptive synergid, ARO1-GFP colocalizes with emerging F-actin structures near the site of sperm cell fusion, suggesting additional participation in the mechanism of sperm cell tracking toward the female gametes. The variable localization of ARO1 in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and at the plasma membrane, however, indicates a multifunctional role like that of ?-catenin/Armadillo and the p120 catenins. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57749088579

Models indicate that the interplay of demographic asymmetries, dispersal, divergent natural selection, and adaptive trade-offs across spatially varying environments can give rise to stable range limits. Here we examine sister species of the monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii to identify traits that might contribute to the evolution of the species' ranges and to ask whether adaptive trade-offs between environments can limit their geographic distribution. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, M. cardinalis is found from low to mid elevation and M. lewisii is found from mid to high elevation. We transplanted segregating populations of interspecific hybrids to low and high elevation and cross-pollinated those that survived to flowering to create selected populations that evolved at low or high elevation. When grown in a common environment, the progeny of hybrids selected at high elevation flowered earlier compared to a greenhouse control population, whereas hybrids selected at low elevation displayed increased warm-temperature photosynthetic capacity. If adaptation to one environment entails a cost to adaptation in other environments, then selected hybrid populations should display reduced fitness, relative to an unselected control population, when grown in an environment in which they were not selected. Two such trade-offs were observed in this study, where hybrids selected at high elevation displayed reduced biomass when grown in temperatures characteristic of low elevation and hybrids selected at low elevation showed reduced resistance to freezing. These results identify traits under selection for range expansion and suggest that adaptive trade-offs can contribute to limiting the geographic distribution of species. © 2008 The Author(s).",Flowering time; Geographic distribution; Natural selection; Physiological adaptation; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53149089445

Streptochaeta possesses some features that are commonly found in Poaceae, including a well-differentiated embryo. It also possesses some relatively unusual, presumably derived features, such as non-plumose stigmas, which indicate that it could be insect-pollinated. It shares some features with other early-divergent grasses, such as Pharus, which could represent plesiomorphic conditions for grasses. The inflorescence unit in Streptochaeta has been interpreted as a compound branching system or pseudospikelet. The present data suggest that it is a highly modified spikelet, with a modified flower borne either on a different axis to the basal bracts (glumes) or on the same axis as the basal bracts. The three bracts below the stamens are interpreted as homologous to the lodicules.

The two nonaploid seedlings had alleles of 222 bp at D.CT-61, which is peculiar to the pollen parent, 'Taishuu', whereas they did not have an allele of 136 or 140 bp at D.CT-179, which is peculiar to the seed parent, 'Fuyu'. These results suggest that they might be derived from fertilization of a reduced female gamete with an unreduced male gamete.

The number of alleles per marker ranged from 14 to 44 with an average of 21.4 per locus. A high level of expected heterozygosity was observed among Sudan cultivars (0.841), Morocco cultivars (0.820) and male accessions (0.799). The results indicate that the genetic groups of the Sudan cultivars and/or males do not follow a clear geographic pattern. However, the morocco group showed significant differentiation in relation to the Sudan groups, as measured by F ST values and genetic distances. The effect of the methods of pollination and cultivar selection on the genetic structure was clearly detected by the weak clustering association that was observed for the majority of accessions originating from Sudan and Morocco as well. This suggests the need for further investigation on the genetic diversity of Sudanese date palm germplasm.

In such conditions, safflower appears as a promising alternative because it is cold and drought tolerant. The objective of this study was to determine the responses of the hybrid and open-pollinated safflower genotypes to irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in a highland environment. For this reason, the field research was performed during the years of 2001 and 2002 in eastern Anatolia, Turkey. According to the results of the study, safflower genotypes tested were well adapted to the cool and short-season conditions in this region. The response of seed yield to genotype varied depending on the growing seasons. The non-irrigated plants produced nearly the same seed yield as irrigated ones. Average seed yields of safflower genotypes tested were 914.3 and 928.0 kg/ha in 2001, and 1143.6 and 1139.9 kg/ha in 2002 years for irrigated and non-irrigated experiments, respectively. In general, the genotypes differed in all of the investigated traits. In both irrigated and non-irrigated experiments genotype x year interactions were very significant for all parameters.

We surveyed its population dynamics and reproductive states for 4 years and analyzed the population viability. In a survey of its entire distribution range, a total of 87 S. macrocarpus individuals have been found and 68 individuals have been confirmed in 2007. Thus, the actual population size is estimated to be less than 100 individuals. Environmental conditions and the results of a hand-pollination experiment suggest that low fruit setting in both sexes (female: 4.9-11.2%; hermaphrodite: 0.0%) may be caused by resource limitation. In addition, fruit predation by alien Rattus rattus was observed despite the rare fruit setting. The small effective population size (23.1-24.6 individuals) and hermaphrodite-biased sex ratio (46 hermaphrodites:12 females) would increase the risk of extinction. The habitat of S. macrocarpus was limited to dense scrubland and forest understory, and seedling regeneration was very scarce. During the survey period, 19 individuals (21.8%) were found dead, there were only two seedling recruitments, and the annual population growth rate was 0.979. The lack of occurrence on the south and west slopes and the shortness of shrubs in open spaces suggests that S. macrocarpus suffers stress from both dryness and frequent typhoons. However, S. macrocarpus also exhibited high mortality of shoot in forest understories. These findings suggest that the suitable habitat of S. macrocarpus is likely to be narrow in Ogasawara. While the recent increase of goat grazing has not affected individual mortality, 58.6% of shoots that had been grazed by goats were dead within 2 years. As elasticity analysis had shown that larger individuals make a greater contribution to the population growth rate, repeated goat grazing would impact the S. macrocarpus population in the near future by decreasing the vitality of larger individuals. Emergency measures for protecting the shrub from goat grazing and reinforcing the population through nursery cultivation were proposed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation acts; Endangered species; Fruit set; Goat grazing; Habitat characteristics; Population decline; PVA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849095487

Unlike Ogura MS radishes in which no pollen grain is typically visible during anthesis, a small number of pollen grains stuck together in the dehiscing anthers was observed in the newly identified MS radish. Fluorescein diacetate tests and scanning electron micrographs showed that pollen grains in the new MS radish were severely deformed and non-viable. Cytological examination of pollen development stages showed a clear difference in the defective stage from that seen in Ogura male-sterility. Reciprocal cross-pollination with diverse male-fertile lines indicated that pollen grains of the new MS radish were completely sterile, and the female organs were fully fertile. When the new MS radish and Ogura MS lines were cross-pollinated with a set of eight breeding lines, all F1 progeny originating from crosses with the new MS radish were male-sterile. In contrast, most of the F1 progeny resulting from crosses with Ogura MS lines were male-fertile. These results demonstrated that factors associated with induction of the newly identified male-sterility are different from those of Ogura male-sterility. The lack of restorer lines for the newly identified male-sterility led us to predict that it might be a complete cytoplasmic male-sterility without restorer-of-fertility genes in nuclear genomes. However, cross-pollination with more diverse radish germplasm identified one accession introduced from Russia that could completely restore fertility, proving the existence of restorer-of-fertility gene(s) for the new male-sterility. Meanwhile, the PCR amplification profile of molecular markers for the classification of radish mitochondrial genome types revealed that the new MS radish contained a novel mitotype. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849114991

We show that expression of chimeric repressors derived from NAC-REGULATED SEED MORPHOLOGY1 and -2 (NARS1 and NARS2, also known as NAC2 and NAM, respectively) caused aberrant seed shapes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Double knockout mutant nars1 nars2 exhibited abnormally shaped seeds; moreover, neither nars1 nor nars2 produced abnormal seeds, indicating that NARS1 and NARS2 redundantly regulate seed morphogenesis. Degeneration of the integuments in nars1 nars2 was markedly delayed, while that of the wild type occurred around the torpedo-shaped embryo stage. Additionally, nars1 nars2 showed a defect in embryogenesis: some nars1 nars2 embryos were developmentally arrested at the torpedo-shaped embryo stage. Unexpectedly, however, neither NARS1 nor NARS2 was expressed in the embryo at this stage, although they were found to be expressed in the outer integument. Wild-type pistils pollinated with nars1 nars2 pollen generated normal seeds, while the reverse crossing generated abnormal seeds. Taken together, these results indicate that NARS1 and NARS2 regulate embryogenesis by regulating the development and degeneration of ovule integuments.

We here observed that the nucleolus of polar nuclei is small, and that the fusion of polar nuclei often did not occur at the time of pollination.

The ability of bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens), used for pollination, to acquire and transmit PepMV was investigated, and the prevalence of PepMV in plants and bumble-bees in commercial tomato greenhouses was determined. PepMV infection in plants was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while in bumble-bees direct real-time PCR was used. In the first experiment, the bumble-bees were exposed for 14 days to PepMV-infected plants. After 14 days, almost all bumble-bees were PepMV positive both in the hive (78.5 ± 17.5%) and in the flowers (96.3 ± 3.6%). In the second experiment, bumble-bees were released into a greenhouse with both PepMV-infected source plants and healthy non-infected target plants for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, 61.0 ± 19.5% of the bees collected from the hive and 83.3 ± 16.7% of the bees sampled from the flowers were PepMV positive. Bumble-bees transmitted PepMV from the infected to the healthy non-infected tomato plants. Two weeks after bumble-bee release, the virus was detected in leaf, fruit and flower samples of formerly healthy plants. After 6 weeks, the percentage of PepMV positive samples from the target plants increased to 52.8 ± 2.8% of the leaves and 80.6 ± 8.4% of the fruits. In the control greenhouse without bumble-bees, the target plants did not become infected. Based on the infection levels in flowers, fruits and leaves, the PepMV infection occurred possibly first in the pollinated flowers, and then spread from the fruit that developed from the flowers to other parts of the plant.

Although all genotypes possessed the Sf allele and showed a similar pollen tube growth after self-pollination than after cross-pollination with cross-compatible pollen, fruit sets showed a different behaviour between years, ranging from 16.2 to 24.7%, as well as between treatments, with the highest after self-pollination. The differences between genotypes could be due to the genetic constitution of each genotype, where inbreeding may reduce set by the accumulation of deleterious genes in different members of a progeny. Flower morphology may also affect sets in bagged branches. Thus, in addition to bud density, flower sterility, pollination success and environmental conditions, other traits must be taken into account when evaluating yield in self-compatible almond cultivars, such as the inbreeding effect and the effective autonomous self-pollination. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In response to this pressure, programs for payments for ecosystem services (PES) are developing and organizations are emerging which manage forests in order to supply ecosystem services, rather than only harvest timber. Typically such services are carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, pollination, and watershed protection. Public or private actors interested to invest in or donate money for the provisioning of such services are faced with the problem of choosing the appropriate organization supplying ecosystem services. The goal of this paper was to develop an assessment framework based on the balanced scorecard concept including drivers, impact, performance and context variables. Results of a survey of international market actors were used to determine assessment criteria and their weights. Putting the focus of this paper on drivers and impacts, we assessed Latin American organizations that ""sell"" ecosystem services from tropical forests in terms of their general management, marketing, forest management, client and stakeholder satisfaction, and forest ecosystem status. We found that supplying organizations vary widely with respect to their achievements in these areas. However, the variance of assessment results is influenced even more by the variance in weights the international market actors allocate to the assessment criteria. The insights of this study can contribute to the continuous improvement of management processes in supplying organizations and can support investors and donors in their decision-making with respect to organization supplying ecosystem services. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic-gain multipliers are used in growth models that are typically based on extensive measurements of unimproved or ""woods-run"" stands, to adjust for the increased growth of stands generated from improved seedlots. First-generation progeny test data from multiple breeding zones in the Northwest Tree Improvement Cooperative were used. Data sets included initial heights and diameters and 5-year growth increments for 10- and 15-year-old trees that were identified by open-pollinated families. Nonlinear mixed-effect models were initially developed to predict the average growth of trees in all families, which, taken together, represented woods-run populations. Phenotypic differences in growth rates were then calculated at the family level. Differences among families in height and diameter growth rates were examined using methods from quantitative genetics and raw phenotypic values. Because gain in total height and diameter at age 10 years is currently the most widely available genetic information for improved Douglas-fir, equations were developed to predict genetic-gain multipliers from family breeding values for these traits. A verification procedure illustrated how incorporating multipliers in growth projections could reduce the mean-square error of predicted growth of selected families.

People damage the environment through local activities like clearing land or burning fossil fuels, but the damages only become manifest at larger regional or global scales where no one pays for them. Payments for ecological services like carbon sequestration can correct for these damages caused by scale mismatches. This paper presents a spatially explicit land-use model to investigate the consequences of scale mismatches for pollination and carbon storage services and examine the effect of payment for only carbon storage services. The model integrates processes in multiple spatial scales ranging from the parcel level used by landowners' decision about deforestation, to the larger scale used by animals to pollinate plants, and finally to the global scale where carbon storage services are supplied. We show that payment for carbon storage services can become an effective mechanism to protect forests at the same time that it creates inequities among landowners in income level. These findings suggest that market-based approaches that focus on conservation of a single ecosystem service may reproduce unequal power relations among landowners. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",Decision making; Deforestation; Equity; Land-use change; Markov chain model; Payment of environmental services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-56949091802

However, the extent to which such 'homoeologous silencing' can vary between individual genotypes within a species is unexplored. We have used the single-strand conformation polymorphism assay to identify homoeologue non-expression at 15 single-copy genes across a panel of 16 wheat varieties, representative of the genetic diversity present in modern northern European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). There was no evidence for any homoeologous silencing at seven of the fifteen genes, but in the remaining eight, at least one of the three homoeologues varied qualitatively for expression in either the root or the seedling leaf. The identity of the non-expressed homoeologue was generally consistent, but when the expression profiles of eight informative genes were compared, only two varieties shared the same pattern of silencing. A small-scale study suggested that silencing patterns were largely inherited across self-pollinated generations, and some evidence is presented for the epigenetic segregation of these patterns in a population bred from parents having contrasting silencing profiles. Epigenetic variation exerts a significant effect on phenotype, so given the ubiquity and variability in homoeologous silencing observed in wheat, we suggest that it is likely to play a considerable role in generating phenotypic variation. Thus epigenetic profiling may need to be incorporated as part of the analytical tool kit for predictive wheat breeding. © 2008 The Authors.",Epigenetics; Gene silencing; Polyploidy; SSCP; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53549108881

These sampled trees represent shortleaf pine and loblolly pine, as they existed across their native geographic ranges before intensive forest management. Using 17 primer pairs, a total of 96 AFLPs between shortleaf pine and loblolly pine were produced and scored on the sample trees and two control-pollinated F1 interspecies hybrids and their parents. In addition, the well known isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) isozyme marker was scored for all trees. IDH detected two putative hybrids among the loblolly pine samples and two among the shortleaf pine samples, while either 13 or 12 putative hybrids were detected using all AFLP markers and IDH and either NewHybrids or Structure software, respectively. Results of this study show that later generation hybrids can be reliably identified using AFLP markers and confirmed that IDH is not a definitive marker for detecting hybrids; that is, at least in some seed sources, the alternative species' IDH allele resides in the source species. Based on all the markers, hybridization frequency varied geographically, ranging from 30% in an Arkansas seed source to 0% in several other seed sources. The hybridization level was higher in populations west of the Mississippi River than in populations east of the river; the shortleaf pine hybridization rates were 16.3% and 2.4% and the loblolly pine rates were 4.5% and 3.3%, west and east of the river, respectively. The results suggest that hybridization between these two species is significant but varies by seed source and species, and the potential for the unintended creation of hybrids should be considered in forest management decisions regarding both natural and artificial regeneration. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Genetic diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749152753

In this study, 21 F1 and 10 F2 populations from parents with either bitter or non-bitter ('sweet') phenotype were tested by seed tasting. Both the 'bitter' and the 'sweet' phenotypes were represented in populations from 'bitterxbitter' and 'sweetxsweet' crosses, as well as from self-pollination of either bitter- or sweet-seeded trees, providing evidence that more than one gene is involved in this trait. Ten populations showed segregation ratios inconsistent with a monofactorial inheritance of seed taste with the 'sweet' trait dominant over the 'bitter'. On the other hand, data from spectrophotometric assays indicate that seed cyanoglucoside content cannot be regarded as a quantitative trait. All the observed segregation ratios can be explained by an inheritance mechanism based on five, non-linked genes, involved in two distinct biochemical pathways. Three genes would control different steps in an 'additive' pathway (either the biosynthesis of cyanoglucosides, or their transport, or both) leading to accumulation of these metabolites in seeds: homozygosis of recessive alleles of at least one of them would result in the sweet phenotype. Two more genes would provide a cleaving activity, participating to cyanoglucoside catabolism; heterozygosis or homozygosis of dominant alleles at these loci would produce the 'sweet' phenotype, while homozygosis for recessive alleles of at least one of them would interrupt the catabolic pathway, leading to the 'bitter' trait, if associated with the anabolic function. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Apricot; Complementary genes; Cyanogenic glucosides; Epistasis; Inheritance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49849102043

Variation in flower colours within the hybrid zone was continuous; the most similar colours were predicted not to be discriminated from one another in natural foraging situations. However, when compared at a scale corresponding to bees' foraging range, some flower colours could be discriminated from all colours displayed by neighbouring plants. This could affect pollinator behaviour and explain lower visitation rates within the centre of the hybrid zone.

Open-pollinated seed from 16 populations along an altitudinal transect (1600 to 2450 m) were collected near Morelia, State of Michoacán, México. A common-garden provenance test, established with 2.5-year-old seedlings, was assessed for frost resistance conducting a laboratory frost damage test (-9°C). Results indicate that there were significant differences among provenances (P = 0.0261) for frost damage. Variation among provenances was structured as an altitudinal cline, with populations from lower altitudes being the least tolerant to frost. Linear regression statistics suggest that for each increment of 100 m of provenance altitude, there will be a 5.2% decrease in frost damage. We suggest the use of two provisional altitudinal seed zones of 400 m breadth each (lower and upper limits for zone 1: 1600 m and 2000 m of altitude; for zone 2: 2000 and 2400 m, respectively), and for reforestation of a given site, the use of seedlings originated from seed of the same seed zone or within ±200 m of altitude from the elevation of the reforestation site.",Altitudinal genetic variation; Frost damage; Frost hardiness; Pinus devoniana; Pinus michoacana; Provenances; Seed and seedling movement guidelines; Seed zoning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849165533

Here we present replacement costs as a more accurate value estimate of insect pollination as an ecosystem service, although this method could also be applied to other services. The importance of insect pollination to agriculture is unequivocal. However, whether this service is largely provided by wild pollinators (genuine ecosystem service) or managed pollinators (commercial service), and which of these requires immediate action amidst reports of pollinator decline, remains contested. If crop pollination is used to argue for biodiversity conservation, clear distinction should be made between values of managed- and wild pollination services. Current methods either under-estimate or over-estimate the pollination service value, and make use of criticised general insect and managed pollinator dependence factors. We apply the theoretical concept of ascribing a value to a service by calculating the cost to replace it, as a novel way of valuing wild and managed pollination services. Adjusted insect and managed pollinator dependence factors were used to estimate the cost of replacing insect- and managed pollination services for the Western Cape deciduous fruit industry of South Africa. Using pollen dusting and hand pollination as suitable replacements, we value pollination services significantly higher than current market prices for commercial pollination, although lower than traditional proportional estimates. The complexity associated with inclusive value estimation of pollination services required several defendable assumptions, but made estimates more inclusive than previous attempts. Consequently this study provides the basis for continued improvement in context specific pollination service value estimates. © 2008 Allsopp et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-52649167878

However, long-distance pollen flow is difficult to assess, especially when the plant also relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered material) escape over several kilometers. However, most between-flower flights occur within plant patches, while very few occur between plant patches. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Cowpea; Radio-tracking; Vigna unguiculata; Xylocopa flavorufa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51649117319

However, little is known about the synthesis of aroma compounds during the development of the C. sativus stigma. The developing stigma is nearly odorless, but before and at anthesis, the aromatic compound ?-ionone becomes the principal norisoprenoid volatile in the stigma. In this study, four carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) genes, CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, CsCCD4a, and CsCCD4b, were isolated from C. sativus. Expression analysis showed that CsCCD1a was constitutively expressed, CsCCD1b was unique to the stigma tissue, but only CsCCD4a and -b had expression patterns consistent with the highest levels of ?-carotene and emission of ?-ionone derived during the stigma development. The CsCCD4 enzymes were localized in plastids and more specifically were present in the plastoglobules. The enzymatic activities of CsCCD1a, CsCCD1b, and CsCCD4 enzymes were determined by Escherichia coli expression, and subsequent analysis of the volatile products was generated by GC/MS. The four CCDs fell in two phylogenetically divergent dioxygenase classes, but all could cleave ?-carotene at the 9,10(9?,10?) positions to yield ?-ionone. The data obtained suggest that all four C. sativus CCD enzymes may contribute in different ways to the production of ?-ionone. In addition, the location and precise timing of ?-ionone synthesis, together with its known activity as a fragrance and insect attractant, suggest that this volatile may have a role in Crocus pollination. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54049092870

Seed cones were collected from 17 mother trees, and the percentage of filled seed were calculated for five cones per tree. In addition, local stand density of pollen donors and total trees were investigated within r &lt; 30 m from the focal mother trees. Using four polymorphic microsatellite markers, the average pairwise kinship coefficient FS and multilocus outcrossing rate tm were estimated on germinated seedlings sampled from 14 mother trees. FS showed significant positive correlation to local total tree density (r = 0.541, p = 0.046). Since FS is inversely proportional to the effective number of pollen donors Nep, genetic diversity of pollen pool was decreased in mother trees with higher local total tree density.

It has done so by evolving an ingenious mechanism of reproductive assurance in which the senescing epipetalous corolla bends down, abscisses and slides down its style dragging its anthers over the stigma lobes, resulting in self-pollination. This dragging mechanism both depends on the plants ability to self-pollinate and presumably promotes the evolution of self-pollination by providing an advantage-invasion of new habitats-to counter-balance the disadvantages of selfing. M. verbenaceus has evolved a second means of reproductive assurance that depends on the nearness of the anthers to the stigma lobes. They are close, even touching, in the red flowers, leading to much self-pollination and are well separated in the yellow flowers leading to little self-pollination. This advantage of the red-flowered plants likely explains the relative abundance of the red morph and the rarity of the yellow morph in nature as well as the greater seed set of the red-flowered morph than that of the yellow-flowered morph. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",Architecture of the flower; Dragging; Grand Canyon; Mimulus verbenaceus; Phrymaceae; Plantaginaceae; Reproductive assurance; Scrophulariaceae; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68749086884

In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of the stingless bees Scaptotrigona aff. depilis Moure and Nannotrigona testaceicornis Lepeletier as pollinators of cucumber plants (Cucumus sativus var. caipira) in greenhouses during the Brazilian winter season. The study was conducted in four greenhouses (GH), of which two greenhouses contained bee colonies to ascertain pollination of the cucumber plants (GH I, with S. aff. depilis, GH II, with N. testaceicornis), whereas the other two greenhouses (GH III, GH IV) had no bee colonies and served as control groups. Furthermore, we planted cucumbers in an open field plot (OA) where pollination by any/various visiting insects could occur. Each of the experimental areas measured 87.5 m 2. Without pollination (GH III, GH IV), the plants produced a low number of cucumbers, and the fruits were smaller and less heavy than in those experimental areas where pollination occurred. In the open field area, not protected against unfavorable climatic conditions, the plants produced fewer flowers than the plants in the greenhouses. The highest cucumber yield (with the highest amount of perfect fruits) was found in those greenhouses which housed the stingless bees as pollinators (GH I, GH II). Our results demonstrate that stingless bees can be successfully and efficiently used as pollinators of greenhouse cucumbers during the winter season.",Brazilian social bee; Fruit production; Greenhouse crop,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57349138921

Cyrtopodium polyphyllum occurs on rocks or in sandy soils, in restinga vegetation along the Brazilian coast. It flowers during the wet season and its inflorescences produce a high number of resupinate yellow flowers. Cyrtopodium polyphyllum offers no rewards to its pollinators, but mimics the yellow, reward-producing flowers of nearby growing Stigmaphyllon arenicola (oil) and Crotalaria vitellina (nectar) individuals. Several species of bee visit flowers of C. polyphyllum, but only two species of Centris (Centris tarsata and Centris labrosa) act as pollinators. Visits to flowers of C. polyphyllum were scarce and, as a consequence, low-fruit set was recorded under natural conditions. Such low-fruit production contrasts with the number of fruits each plant bears after manual pollination, suggesting deficient pollen transfer among plants. C. polyphyllum is self-compatible and has a high-fruit set in both manual self- and cross-pollinated flowers. Furthermore, fruits (2%) are formed by self-pollination assisted by rain. This facultative self-pollination mechanism is an important strategy to provide reproductive assurance to C. polyphyllum as rainfall restricts the foraging activity of its pollinating bees. Fruits derived from treatments and under natural conditions had a similar high rate of potentially viable seed. Moreover, these seeds had a low polyembryony rate, which did not exceed 5%. C. polyphyllum acts by deceit involving optical signals and exploits other yellow-flowered species within its habitat by attracting their pollinators. The low capsule production under natural conditions was expected, but its reproductive success is assured through self-pollination by rain and high seed viability. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Centridini; Cyrtopodiinae; Cyrtopodium; Floral biology; Orchidaceae; Pollination by deceit; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349086786

Plant-pollinator interactions are crucial for the reproduction of most angiosperms. When faced with perturbations, plant-pollinator networks might be robust mainly due to the presence of highly generalist species. Perturbations can, in turn, affect how pollinators exploit their food sources and therefore their degree of generalization. 2. In particular, generalization of pollinators might vary with forager density. At high densities floral resources available in plant communities would be more rapidly depleted than at low densities. According to optimal foraging theory (OFT), this decrease in resources should lead to an increase in diet breadth. 3. We investigated the impact of pollinator density on diet breadth of Bombus terrestris. We recorded the individual foraging behaviour of bumblebees from eight colonies. They foraged in presence of either one or several conspecifics on experimental plant communities composed of five plant species. Diet breadth was calculated as the number of plant species visited, as well as by the Levins index. We analyzed the effect of forager density on diet breadth at both the individual and the colony levels. 4. We found that forager density affected degree of generalization at individual and colony levels. A more competitive environment increased individual generalization, as predicted by OFT, and decreased the variability in generalization across colonies. Moreover, we found that bumblebee size was positively related to the amplitude of diet breadth change. 5. Synthesis. Our study sheds light on an additional level of complexity of plant-pollinator systems, showing that pollinator diet breadth is a flexible trait which results from behavioural adaptation to resource availability. More generally, changes in foraging insects' diet via competition for resources are likely to ensue from anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance and to impact upon the functioning of plant-pollinator networks. © 2008 The Authors.",Bombus terrestris; Bumblebees; Diet breadth; Generalization; Intraspecific competition; Levins index; Optimal foraging; Plant communities; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649105285

Experimental investigations of the effects of variation in flower size and floral display on pollinator visitation can provide insights into the evolution of floral dimorphism in dioecious plants. • Here, we investigated pollinator responses to experimental arrays of dioecious Sagittaria latifolia in which we manipulated floral display and flower size. We also examined whether there were changes in pollinator visitation with increasing dimorphism in flower size. • In S. latifolia, males have larger flowers and smaller floral displays than females. Visitation by pollinators, mainly flies and bees, was more frequent for male than for female inflorescences and increased with increasing flower size, regardless of sex. The number of insect visits per flower decreased with increasing floral display in males but remained constant in females. Greater sexual dimorphism in flower size increased visits to male inflorescences but had no influence on the number of visits to female inflorescences. • These results suggest that larger flower sizes would be advantageous to both females and males, and no evidence was found that females suffer from increased flower-size dimorphism. Small daily floral displays may benefit males by allowing extended flowering periods and greater opportunities for effective pollen dispersal. © The Authors (2008).",Floral display; Flower size; Pollinators; Sagittaria latifolia; Sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49249105347

An integrative approach combining field studies with lab analysis was adopted. Pollen traps were used to measure air-borne pollen loads and artificial isolation experiments were applied to test the potentiality of cross-pollination or apomixes. Results show that the duration of the flowering of Eremurus anisopterus varied from late April to mid-May. Anthesis of a single flower often lasted for 1 d. However, if the daily maximum air temperature was under 20°C, the anthesis of a single flower could be prolonged up to 2 d. The pollen dispersion period of the single flower could last for 4 to 5 h, from 10:30 to 15:00 local time, with the duration of pollen dispersion for a single anther lasting approximately 40 min. The heterotypical maturation of the stigma could significantly prolong the pollen dispersion period of the single flower suggesting an adaptation to the habitat of E. anisopterus in the desert where the pollinators were not reliable. The timing of the blossoms of the ephemeroid plant show close correlations with the wind velocity and the habit and characteristics of the pollinators in the desert. Plant pollens may be spread to over 70 m by wind with approximately 60% of the pollens falling within 20 m away from the plant. Insects, especially bees, hover flies, flesh flies, mason bees and Halictus sp. were very important pollinators. Bees and hover flies usually landed on the yellowish green spot on the tepal and then entered the flower along the purple vein on the pink tepals. The yellowish green spot might be a mimetic structure of nectar that could attract insects to visit. This was also an adaptation of the plant to the sandy desert environment. A higher visiting frequency was reached between 10:30 and 13:30. The pollen-ovule ratio (P/O) of E. anisopterus (6164) suggested that the species was from cross-pollination according to Cruden's criterion. However, the artificial isolation experiment shows that E. anisopterus is self-compatible which might act as a compensation mechanism for the inadequate opportunities for breeding in the desert environment. Since there was no seed set in the bagged emasculated flowers, apomixes did not occur. In conclusion, E. anisopterus might adapt to the unreliable pollinator habits by self-pollination and by lengthening the pollen dispersion period of a single flower. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",Ephemeroid plant; Eremurus anisopterus; Heterotypical maturation of stamina; P/O; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47649097243

These experiments are the first to examine directly the impact of honey bee, Apis mellifera, nest invaders on plant pollination and fitness. A cost to pollination could occur under two scenarios: (1) at the colony level where nest invaders compromise the health of the foraging cohort and reduce their efficacy as pollinators or (2) at the community level where invaders simply kill bee colonies and reduce the local pollinator population. Honey bee colonies were manipulated to achieve different levels of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor or nest-invading beetle Aethina tumida and tented under one of two model plants: canola (Brassica napus) or rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei). On the basis of single-bee flower visits, fruit-set was reduced in blueberry with bees from varroa-parasitized colonies. However, on the basis of colonies, there were no differences in blueberry fruit-set, number of blueberry pollen tetrads deposited on the stigma, and pod-set in canola among colonies with different levels of nest invaders or no-invader controls. Thus, within the range of nest invader densities used in this study, individual inefficiencies were erased by compensatory multiple flower visits by this colonial pollinator. By failing to affirm the functionality of scenario (1) this study indirectly supports scenario (2): the major contribution of honey bee nest invaders toward a pollinator deficit is the simple eradication of colonies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The pollen season in Poland usually begins in February but the pollination of trees and bushes in early spring is very changeable and weather-dependent. Aim of the study. The aim of the study was to assess the pollination of early-blooming trees and bushes, including hazel, poplar, and willow in ?ód? area in 2008, with special regard to the beginning of pollination, maximum daily pollen count and the total yearly pollen count. Material and methods. The studies were conducted using the volumetric method with the Lanzoni apparatus. The beginning of pollination was determined using the so-called 1% method. Results. In 2008, the pollination of trees and bushes began very early. A long-term perspective shows that the pollination of hazel in 2008 was the earliest in the recent 8 years - 1 February, and alder - 6 February. Maximum daily pollen count for hazel and alder were average in comparison to previous years. The total pollen fall for hazel was 304 grains/season and for alder over 4100 grains/season. No significant pollination interruption due to the weather change was observed in the pollination of early-blooming trees in 2008. A significant increase in the total pollen count and maximum daily count of alder and poplar was observed. Conclusions. Continuous acceleration of the beginning of the tree blooming period occurring in recent years requires monitoring from early January, especially with regard to increased intensity of alder and hazel pollination. © Alergia Astma Immunologia 2008.",Alder; Hazel; Pollen count; Pollination season; Poplar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-60749105990

In this study we manipulated artificial crab spiders on flowers of Rubus rosifolius to test the effects of prédation risk on flower-visiting insects and strength of traitmediated indirect effects to plant fitness. In addition, we tested which predator traits (e.g., forelimbs, abdomen) are recognized and avoided by pollinators. Total visitation rate was higher for control flowers than for flowers with an artificial crab spider. In addition, flowers with a sphere (simulating a spider abdomen) were more frequently visited than those with forelimbs or the entire spider model. Furthermore, the presence of artificial spiders decreased individual seed set by 42% and fruit biomass by 50%. Our findings indicate that pollinators, mostly bees, recognize and avoid flowers with prédation risk; forelimbs seem to be the predator trait recognized and avoided by hymenopterans. Additionally, predator avoidance by pollinators resulted in pollen limitation, thereby affecting some components of plant fitness (fruit biomass and seed number). Because most pollinator species that recognized predation risk visited many other plant species, trait-mediated indirect effects of spiders cascading down to plant fitness may be a common phenomenon in the Atlantic rainforest ecosystem. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Atlantic rainforest; Floral biology; Food web; Foraging behavior; Indirect interactions; Predator traits; Seed set; Trait-mediated top-down effects; Visual cues,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54549105523

The minimal viable population was estimated for conservation in situ, indicating fragments with possibilities of maintaining genetic equilibrium diversity in the short term (except F3) and in the long term (only F5). The N? e/N ratios was also calculated to contribute to vegetation enrichment, area recovery or creation of new vegetation corridors. We found high levels of gene diversity in the vegetation corridors, genetic identity with the fragments and absence of inbreeding.

The present study determined the breeding system and legitimate pollinators of Oroxylum indicum Vent. in Songkhla and Patthalung Provinces, Thailand. Oroxylum indicum exhibits steady-state flowering, with one or two flowers per inflorescence opening each night. Flowers open in the evening and drop off shortly after midnight, while its bilabiate stigma is highly sensitive, and quickly close upon being touched. Oroxylum indicum is self-incompatible. Hand-cross pollination and open pollination yielded the highest pollination success (47.7% and 31.2% respectively, n = 7 trees). About 900 pollen grains are needed for initiating fruit set. It is confirmed that a fruit bat, Eonycteris spelaea, is the legitimate pollinator. Bats are responsible for all pollen load and the pollen load from only one visit is generally sufficient to initiate fruit set. Although Eonycteris spelaea is effective, it is an inefficient pollinator.

The objective of this study was to understand the relationships among floral characteristics, specialization, mating system and the role of floral visitors under different ecological contexts. • Methods: Five populations were studied in north-western Argentina, from 700 to 1570 m a.s.l. Anthesis, colour and odour patterns, stigmatic receptivity, visitors and pollination mechanism were examined and mating-system experiments were performed. • Key Results: The petals are highly modified and the keel shows 3.75-5.25 revolutions. The sense of asymmetry was always left-handed. Hand-crosses showed that V. caracalla is self-compatible, but depends on pollinators to set seeds. Hand-crossed fruits were more successful than hand-selfed ones, with the exception of the site at the highest elevation. Bombus morio (queens and workers), Centris bicolor, Eufriesea mariana and Xylocopa eximia trigger the pollination mechanism (a 'brush type'). The greatest level of self-compatibility and autonomous self-pollination were found at the highest elevation, together with the lowest reproductive success and number of pollinators (B. morio workers only). • Conclusions: Self-fertilization may have evolved in the peripheral population at the highest site of V. caracalla because of the benefits of reproductive assurance under reduced pollinator diversity. © The Author 2008.

Yeasts were frequent and abundant in nectar of all species, and variation in yeast density was correlated with drastic changes in nectar sugar concentration and composition. Yeast communities built up in nectar from early to late floral stages, at which time all nectaries contained yeasts, often at densities between 104 and 105 cells/mm3. Total sugar concentration and percentage sucrose declined, and percentage fructose increased, with increasing density of yeast cells in nectar.

(Anthericaceae) were examined. We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to determine the distribution of genetic diversity within and among 10 German A. liliago populations, ranging in size from 116 to over 2 million ramets. The genetic diversity of an A. liliago population was highly positively correlated with its population size. The overall differentiation among populations (Phi-ST = 0.41, P < 0.0001, AMOVA) was considerably higher than expected for a species with a mixed breeding system. No strong correlation (P < 0.01) was detected between fitness parameters and population size and genetic diversity. The reproductive output (seeds per ramet) was only highly correlated (P < 0.001) with the proportion of flowering ramets in a population which could be caused by a more effective pollination in large populations which are more attractive to specialized pollinators. The specialized A. liliago pollinator Merodon rufus (Syrphidae) and high abundances of solitary bees could only be found in A. liliago populations with more than 10,000 individuals. Genetic differentiation among the investigated A. liliago populations may have been caused by limited seed and pollen dispersal and a mixed mating system permitting a high selfing rate. The differentiation among the small and isolated populations lacking main pollinators seems to be caused by genetic drift. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Habitat fragmentation; Merodon rufus; Pollinator; Population genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48449096528

We found that pollinia were far more frequently transferred between the purple-flowered var. incarnata and the pale-flowered var. ochroleuca than between plants of the same variety.

We report the joint effects of population size and density on pollinator visitation and pollination success for Lupinus perennis (Fabaceae). Focusing on five pairs of populations, we matched one small population (125-800 flowering plants) with one distinctly larger population (1000-3000 flowering plants). In these pairs, population size did not affect pollinator communities or pollination success. All measures of pollination success increased significantly with density. Only bee behavior (number of flowers probed per inflorescence) exhibited a significant interaction of size and density. Testing whether population sizes smaller than those in the paired populations might affect pollination, we gathered pollen tube samples from 14 unpaired populations (16-215 flowering plants). Combining these data with those from the paired populations revealed a significant decrease in pollination for smaller populations, indicating that effects of population size may be detectable only when populations smaller than a few hundred plants are sampled. We found that effects of density are consistent and much stronger than those of population size. Our results suggest that both size and density of natural populations should be considered in designing restoration and reintroduction programs for this threatened plant. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

However, the molecular basis of such an effect still remains largely unknown. Here, we report the role of a member of CBL (Calcineurin B-Like) Interacting Protein Kinase (CIPK) family, OsCIPK23, in pollination and stress responses in rice. Molecular analyses revealed that it is mainly expressed in pistil and anther but up-regulated by pollination, as well as by treatments of various abiotic stresses and phytohormones. RNA interference-mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress. In consistent, overexpression of OsCIPK23 induced the expression of several drought tolerance related genes. Taken together, these results indicate that OsCIPK23 is a multistress induced gene and likely mediates a signaling pathway commonly shared by both pollination and drought stress responses in rice. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.",drought; OsCIPK23; pollination; rice (Oryza sativa L.); water,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51549085804

The focus is on the pollination biology and on the remarkable relationship of this plant species to Amazonina platystylata, its cockroach pollinator. This appears to be only the second record of pollination by cockroaches. • Methods: Pollination ecology was investigated by combining morphological studies, field observations and additional experiments. Floral scent was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The role of acetoin, the major component of the scent of this species of Clusia, in attracting pollinators was examined in field attraction experiments. The ability of cockroaches to perceive acetoin was investigated by electroantennography (EAG). • Key Results: The Clusia species studied produces seeds only sexually. Its nocturnal flowers are visited by crickets, ants, moths and cockroaches. A species of cockroach, Amazonina platystylata, is the principal pollinator. The reward for the visit is a liquid secretion produced by tissues at the floral apex and at the base of the ovary. Although the cockroaches have no structures specialized for pollen collection, their body surface is rough enough to retain pollen grains. The cockroaches show significant EAG reactions to floral volatiles and acetoin, suggesting that the floral scent is a factor involved in attracting the cockroaches to the flowers. • Conclusions: The results suggest that the plant-cockroach interaction may be quite specialized and the plant has probably evolved a specific strategy to attract and reward its cockroach pollinators. Acetoin is a substance involved in the chemical communication of several other cockroach species and it seems plausible that the plant exploits the sensitivity of cockroaches to this compound to attract them to the flowers as part of the pollination syndrome of this species. © The Author 2008.

Some chiropterophilous plants are also pollinated by other animals; the syndrome is therefore best regarded as a hypothesis for which field observations and pollination experiments are required. The present study aimed, for the first time, to determine the breeding system of the economically important canopy trees, Parkia speciosa and P. timoriana, and to identify their pollinators. Pollination experiments carried out in Trang and Songkhla Provinces, in 28 trees of P. speciosa and four P. timoriana indicated that they are self incompatible. Open pollination resulted in the highest fruit set (average 60-67% of inflorescences per tree) although this was not significantly different from hand-crossed pollination (48-60%). Insect pollination resulted in fruit set in only 12% of P. speciosa inflorescences. Fruit bats, mainly Eonycteris spelaea, visit flowering plants continuously from dusk till after midnight. Nocturnal and diurnal insects (moths and stingless bees respectively) visit capitula, mostly at the nectar zone. Nectarivorous bats are the most effective pollinator for P. speciosa and P. timoriana. The fact that populations of E. spelaea appear to be declining throughout their distribution is therefore a matter of increasing concern.

Similarity of floral cues between co-flowering species influences how rapidly pollinators learn to avoid deceptive plants. This learning process, which affects the reproductive success of deceptive plants, may additionally depend on relative timing of flowering of sympatric rewarding and deceptive species. We tested the combined effects of corolla colour similarity and flowering order of rewarding and deceptive artificial inflorescences on visitation by naïve bumblebees. When deceptive inflorescences were offered after rewarding inflorescences, bumblebees visited them four times more often if both species were similar compared with when they were dissimilar. Pollinator visitation rate to deceptive inflorescences offered before rewarding inflorescences was intermediate and independent of similarity. Thus, early-flowering deceptive species avoid the costs of dissimilarity with rewarding species. This mechanism may favour adaptive evolution of flowering phenology in deceptive species and explain why temperate deceptive orchids usually flower earlier than rewarding ones. © 2008 The Authors.",Artificial inflorescences; Bombus terrestris; Corolla colour similarity; Deceptive pollination; Flowering phenology; Pollinator behaviour; Pollinator learning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549093129

The objective of this study was to reveal the effects of grazing on pollination as an example of interaction biodiversity in Mongolian grasslands. We established three plots according to grazing intensity on the eastern steppe of Mongolia. In each plot, we recorded the numbers of insect-pollinated plants and observed the foraging behavior of pollinators in June and August. The richness of insect-pollinated species was high and these species were most abundant in lightly grazed plots, and formed complex relations with diverse pollinators. But, frequency of flower visitation and pollination index were greater in heavily grazed plots. All pollination properties were poorest in intermediately grazed plots. These results suggest that the forb-biased foraging of sheep and goats reduces the floral diversity of insect-pollinated species, and consequently reduces pollinators in the intermediately grazed plots. In the heavily grazed plots, only limited ruderal species could survive under heavy cattle grazing, and such simple vegetation formed unbalanced but strong bonds with pollinators. Removal simulation showed that the mutual network was more fragile with respect to the extinction of certain species.

Bag X01, Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg 3209, South Africa","It has been suggested that flowers of some plants are specialized for pollination by two unrelated species (or functional groups) of pollinators. However, evidence for 'bimodal pollination systems' has been extremely limited. Studies of the milkweed Xysmalobium undulatum in South Africa showed that its flowers are visited by a range of different insects (representing 18 families), but only two groups, represented by the chafer beetle Atrichelaphinis tigrina and pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis, effect pollination. Experiments showed that both these pollinator groups are effective in removing and inserting pollinia. Pollinia are attached to clypeal hairs and mouthparts on the wasps and tarsal hairs and spines on the beetles. Although considerably less abundant than the beetles, Hemipepsis spp. wasps move more quickly among flowers and appeared to be more effective pollinators overall. Experimental hand-pollinations conducted in the field showed that X. undulatum is genetically self-incompatible and thus completely reliant on pollinators for reproduction. We conclude that X. undulatum has a bimodal pollination system, specialized for pollination by Hemipepsis pompilid wasps and the chafer beetle A. tigrina. © 2008 The Author(s).",Apocynaceae; Breeding system; Pollination syndromes; South Africa; Specialized pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749147180

Fig trees (Ficus) are pollinated only by agaonid wasps, whose larvae also gall fig ovules. Each ovule develops into either a seed (when pollinated) or a wasp (when an egg is also laid inside) but not both. 2. Ovipositing wasps (foundresses) favour ovules near the centre of the enclosed inflorescence (syconium or 'fig'), leaving ovules near the outer wall to develop into seeds. This spatial stratification of wasps and seeds ensures reproduction in both partners, and thereby enables mutualism persistence. However, the mechanism(s) responsible remain(s) unknown. 3. Theory shows that foundresses will search for increasingly rare inner ovules and ignore outer ovules, as long as ovipositing in outer ovules is sufficiently slow and/or if inner ovules confer greater fitness to wasps. The fig-pollinator mutualism can therefore be stabilized by strong time constraints on foundresses and by offspring fitness gradients over variation in ovule position. 4. Female fig wasps cannot leave their galls without male assistance. We found that females in outer ovules were unlikely to be released. Inner ovules thus have added value to foundresses, because their female offspring are more likely to mate and disperse. 5. For those offspring that did emerge, gall position (inner/outer) and body size did not influence the order in which female pollinators exited syconia, nor did early emerging wasps enjoy increased life spans. 6. We also found that the life spans of female wasps nearly doubled when given access to moisture. We suggest that conflict resolution in the fig-pollinator mutualism may thus be influenced by tropical seasonality, because wasps may be less able to over-exploit ovules in dry periods due to time constraints. © 2008 The Authors.",Cooperation; Ficus; Fig wasp; Mutualism; Optimal foraging; Pleistodontes imperialis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649106458

(Apidae), for pollinating tree-fruit crops. One species, Osmia lignaria Say, has shown great potential in western North America and was recently introduced into Nova Scotia for evaluation as a pollinator of apple, Malus Mill. (Rosaceae). A major component of that study was to develop management options for O. lignaria, including methods of sustaining nesting females following crop flowering to maximize population recovery for pollination in subsequent seasons. The objective of this study was to evaluate bigleaf lupine, Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl. (Fabaceae), as a secondary food plant for nesting female O. lignaria by investigating nesting activity, pollen-use patterns, and fecundity. During 2002-2003, female O. lignaria collected high proportions of apple pollen (>70%) during mid and late flowering; after then, most pollen (>90%) was collected from bigleaf lupine. The flowering period of lupine in Nova Scotia (late May to early July) slightly overlapped that of apple, so there was no scarcity of pollen resources during the life-span of O. lignaria. Most nests typically showed high levels (?200%) of population growth, but recorded levels varied among nest types and locations. In 2004, nests closer to lupine plots exhibited significantly greater population recovery than nests located farther away (i.e., approximately 600 m). Bigleaf lupine is a suitable plant species for meeting the pollen requirements of nesting populations of O. lignaria following apple flowering, thus promoting the recovery of populations to meet apple pollination requirements in subsequent seasons. © 2008 Entomological Society of Canada.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57349155739

'Clemenules' (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.), a parthenocarpic variety that produces seedless fruit due to its self-incompatible nature, but yields seedy fruits when grown under cross-pollination conditions. Experiments were conducted with on-tree 'Clemenules' flowers and 'Fortune' mandarin pollen (C. clementina Hort. ex Tan. × C. reticulata Blanco), which is sexually compatible with the former. Preanthesis treatment at -2 days after anthesis (-2 DAA) enhanced ovule abortion in both unpollinated and cross-pollinated (at +2 DAA) flowers. In the latter, the number of pollen tubes reaching the ovules was significantly reduced although pollen grains were not treated; thus, fertilization was partially avoided and seed set was reduced. When GA3 was applied at anthesis (0 DAA) at the time of pollination, ovule abortion was again enhanced, and pollen tube growth was completely arrested; thus, fertilization was prevented and seed set was impeded. When GA3 was applied 24 h after pollination (+1 DAA in flowers pollinated at anthesis), pollen tube growth was impaired but not arrested and ovule abortion was enhanced; therefore, fertilization was not prevented but impaired. We conclude that, when applied the days around anthesis, GA3 (10 mg l-1) impairs fertilization by either enhancing ovule abortion or reducing pollen tube growth, in 'Clemenules' flowers under cross-pollination conditions. The intensity of the response depends on the physiological flower state at the moment of treatment. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Furthermore, the use of bumblebees as pollinators in agriculture and horticulture has become more widespread in recent years, which has generated the need to determine the potential risks of biological control agents against these insects. This study investigated the side-effects of two commercial Trichoderma-based biofungicides against the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The two commercial compounds tested were Binab-TF-WP and Binab-TF-WP-Konc, both of which contain combinations of Trichoderma harzianum ATCC20476 and Trichoderma polysporum ATCC20475. The bumblebees were exposed to the biocontrol agents under laboratory conditions at their respective maximum concentration in the field (MFRC), and then exposed via three potential routes of exposure: dermal contact, orally via the drinking of treated sugar water, and via treated pollen. The treatments were evaluated through recording worker mortality (lethal effects) and any effects on the production of drones (sublethal effects). The laboratory tests demonstrated that the two Binab products did not cause worker mortality or adversely affect reproduction. In addition, we investigated whether the Trichoderma-based products could survive or grow on the bodies of the adult workers. In no case was survival or growth of the biofungicide observed on the workers. When the effects of these compounds were evaluated against bumblebee larvae (third and fourth instars), no entomopathogenic effects were found. Overall, the results obtained under laboratory conditions indicate that the two Binab products are safe for use in combination with B. terrestris. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to explore the pollen-dispensing mechanism triggered by special anther appendages in Incarvillea arguta. • Methods: Field studies were conducted to record floral characteristics, pollinator visitations, and flower-pollinator interactions. Measurements of flowers and pollinators were analysed statistically. Pollen counts following a series of floral manipulations were used to evaluate pollen dispensing efficiency and function of the anther appendages. • Key Results: Field observations determined that two species of Bombus (bumble-bees) were the primary pollinators of I. arguta with a mean visiting frequency of 1.42 visitations per flower h-1. The results display a diminishing pollen dispensing pattern; the proportion of remaining pollen removed by pollinators decreased from 27% to 10% and 7% in subsequent visits. Anther appendages act as a trigger mechanism to dispense pollen. The arrangement of the anthers and appendages function to control pollen load and timing. Mechanical stimulation experiments revealed that one set of appendages is only triggered by stimulation in the direction moving into the flower, while the other set is only triggered by stimulation in the opposite direction (exiting the flower). • Conclusions: The anther appendage is a pollen-dispensing trigger mechanism. The configuration of the stamens and duel trigger system has evolved to allocate pollen in allotments to enhance male function. © The Author 2008.

However, if a locally rare species is very attractive in terms of the rewards it offers pollinators, it may be preferentially visited. Spiranthes romanzoffiana is a nectar rewarding, geographically rare, endangered orchid species which forms small populations in Ireland, co-flowering with more common, florally rewarding species. We examined visitation rates to S. romanzoffiana and two nectar rewarding co-flowering species (Mentha aquatica and Prunella vulgaris) in the west of Ireland. These three plant species were visited by three bee species (Bombus pascuorum, B. hortorum and Apis mellifera). B. pascuorum was the most common visitor, while A. mellifera was least common. Our results suggest that individual S. romanzoffiana inflorescences compete intraspecifically for visitation from pollinators at high densities. The relationship between visitation to S. romanzoffiana and total floral density appeared to be positive, suggesting interspecific facilitation of pollinator visitation at high densities. Nectar standing crop varied through the season, among species and between open and bagged flowers. Nectar standing crop was not correlated with visitation in S. romanzoffiana. Despite relatively high visitation, S. romanzoffiana produced no mature fruit during this flowering season. The lack of fruit maturation in this species may be a major factor causing its rarity in Europe. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: Genetic diversity was assessed using allozyme and the fluorescently based automated amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Results: Total genetic diversity at species level is low with allozyme assay (0.023), and high with AFLP (0.255) and SSR (0.259) methods. It is observed within populations according to allozyme (>99%), AFLP (>85%), and SSR (>73%) assays. The indices of genetic variability distribution point out the re-colonization of the Sikhote-Alin by ginseng plants from southern refuges during the warming period in the early Holocene. The capability of ginseng plants to cross- and self-pollinate was shown and the assumption that Panax ginseng is a facultative apomictic plant was confirmed. The reproductive system of ginseng possesses high plasticity and stability of the fertilization process that help the species to survive in stress conditions. Disturbances caused by external or internal factors can be reduced due to the morphogenetic potential of ginseng ovule or apomictic embryo development. Analysis of life stages structure of ginseng populations demonstrates that all of them are not full-constituents because some life stages are absent or occur rarely. Conclusion: In all 3 populations, virgin and young generative individuals are predominant. This means that populations studied are viable and the reintroduction of natural ginseng population is possible yet. © 2008 CPS and SIMM.",AFLP; Allozymes; Embryology; Genetic diversity; Mating system; Natural population; Panax ginseng; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51349095604

Cross pollination led to some fruit set in 36 of the 37 different combinations. Overall fruit set was virtually identical irrespective of the combination of parental plants. Mean germination rates were much higher in hybrid seeds, indicating a marked heterosis effect and the possible presence of an inbreeding depression in the source populations: In experimental hybridization the divergent taxa of Caiophora behave like isolated, inbred populations of a single species. Allopatry and different habitat preferences seem to be the key factors keeping the (interfertile) taxa of Caiophora apart in the apparent absence of both postmating isolating mechanisms and obvious isolating mechanisms in phenology and floral biology.

Included were all sections in Miconia (212 species, ?20% of the genus) and 12 of the 15 remaining genera assigned to the tribe (an additional 239 species). Given the tribe's reputation for problematic generic distinctions, it was not surprising that most traditionally recognized taxonomic groups - both genera and sections - were shown to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic. Nevertheless, Miconia is composed of several distinct monophyletic groups, with a large majority of the species belonging to only four clades. Some of these groups represent parts of sections proposed in the last revision of the genus, but most of the diversification seems to have occurred in geographical areas that are more restricted than would have been predicted by the distribution of these sections. Moreover, parallel evolutionary trends are seen in anther form, i.e., shifts from elongate to shorter anthers and from minute-pored to large-pored or slitlike dehiscent anthers. These changes may relate to pollinator shifts, especially from buzz pollination to nonvibrational pollination. Thus, the major evolutionary diversifications within the tribe have been obscured by convergence in stamen morphology, leading to many arbitrary generic and sectional circumscriptions. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Thirty-seven male-sterile, female-sterile mutant lines were generated from 37 independent reversion events at the w4-m locus.

Here we report the presence of at least eight distinct proteins secreted into the floral nectar of the tropical tree Jacaranda mimosifolia (Bignoniaceae). Steps were initiated to identify and characterize these proteins in order to determine potential functions. The N-terminal sequence of the major Jacaranda nectar protein, JNP1, at 43 kDa contained similarity with members of the plant GDSL lipase/esterase gene family. Based upon this sequence, a full-length cDNA was isolated and predicted to encode a mature protein of 339 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. Both raw nectar and heterologously expressed JNP1 displayed lipase/esterase activities. Interestingly, J. mimosifolia flowers produce an opaque, white colored nectar containing spherical, lipophilic particles approximately 5 ?m in diameter and smaller. GS-MS analysis also identified the accumulation of free fatty acids within the nectar. It is proposed that JNP1 hydrolyzes Jacaranda nectar lipids with the concomitant release of free fatty acids. Potential functions of JNP1 in relation to pollinator attraction and prevention of microbial growth within nectar are briefly discussed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",GDSL lipase; Jacaranda mimosifolia; Nectar; Nectaries; Nectary; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48149105145

Mating among close relatives, including selfing, may lead to a reduction in reproductive performance through the effects of prezygotic mating barriers and inbreeding depression. Studying 11 populations of slickspot peppergrass, Lepidium papilliferum (L.F. Hend.) A. Nels. and J.F. Macbr (Brassicaceae), a rare mustard endemic to southwestern Idaho, we investigated whether small populations (16-746 flowering individuals) exhibit spatial structure as previously reported for large populations (>3000 flowering individuals). Through hand-pollination experiments we found that percent fruit set increased with increasing distance between parents up to a distance of 3 m, and declined slightly but nonsignificantly at greater outcrossing distances. Self-pollinated plants produced little or no fruit. Germination of seeds from the hand-pollination experiment revealed signs of inbreeding depression in the offspring. Specifically, leaf length of developing seedlings increased significantly as a function of outcrossing distance. Total leaf number showed a similar, yet statistically nonsignificant, response to outcrossing distance. Overall, our experiments reveal spatial structuring and suggest the occurrence of inbreeding depression in small populations of L. papilliferum. © 2008 NRC Canada.",Inbreeding depression; Outcrossing; Pollination; Spatial structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76349116520

The intensity of natural selection acting on floral phenotypic integration was also estimated and the available evidence regarding the magnitude of floral integration reviewed. • The species studied had similar degrees of floral integration, although significant differences were observed in their variance-covariance structure. Selection acted on subsets of floral traits (i.e. selection on intrafloral integration) rather than on the integration of the whole flower. Average integration was 20% and similar to the estimated mean value of flowering plants. • The review indicated that flowering plants present lower integration than expected by chance.

During general flowering periods (GFP), most Dipterocarpaceae and many other trees flower profusely, while flowering plants are scant between GFP. During flowerless periods, anthophilous animals that depend on floral resources for food may suffer food shortages and subsequently decrease in abundance. Flower-visiting chrysomelid adults are major pollinators for some canopy tree species that flower during GFP. Although such chrysomelids feed on flower petals, the means by which they survive flowerless periods remains unknown. We determined the abundance of flower-visiting chrysomelids in GFP and non-GFP through light trap samples and examined the effects of the presence of young leaves and flowers of dipterocarps on local abundance, and feeding preferences of flower-visiting chrysomelids. We found no clear tendency that the chrysomelid species number and the abundance during GFP were consistently higher than those during non-GFP. Chrysomelid adults were more abundant on trees with many young leaves or flowers than on trees lacking young leaves and flowers. At least a few flower-visiting chrysomelids were observed feeding on young dipterocarp leaves and visiting young leaves and flowers of non-dipterocarps in the canopy during non-GFP. All results consistently suggest that chrysomelids are able to survive flowerless periods by feeding on the young leaves of dipterocarps and on the young leaves and flowers of non-dipterocarps; through this alternate feeding, chrysomelid populations are maintained at sufficient levels to function as effective pollinators of trees that flower during GFP. © 2008 The Author(s).",Beetle pollination; Canopy; Coleoptera; Leaf beetle; Mast flowering; Population dynamics; Shorea; Southeast Asian tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749109146

Previous studies of Allee effects have focused on the effects of variation among populations in size or density on reproduction. Here, the effects of plant distribution within populations on fitness components are explored in a rare plant, Aconitum napellus ssp. lusitanicum, and ecological and genetic mechanisms underlying these effects are identified. • To detect pollen limitation, seed production was compared under natural versus hand-supplemented pollinations on inflorescences of different sizes in natural patches differing both in flower density and in isolation from other patches. Germination rate and juvenile survival of seeds produced in low- and high-density patches were also compared. • Pollen-supplemented flowers always produced more seeds than open-pollinated flowers, especially among small plants and plants growing at low density. Offspring produced in low-density patches exhibited lower fitness that those produced in high-density patches. This could have been caused by post-fertilization mechanisms, including inbreeding depression or differential maternal resource allocation. • These results show that Allee effects on fitness components (ecological and genetic Allee effects) occur within A. napellus populations at different spatial scales.

Bumblebees will forage preferentially on warmer flowers, even if equal nutritional reward is available in cooler flowers. This raises the question of whether warmth and sucrose concentration are processed independently by bees, or whether sweetness detectors respond to higher sugar concentration as well as higher temperature. We find that bumblebees can use lower temperature as a cue to higher sucrose reward, showing that bees appear to process the two parameters strictly independently. Moreover, we demonstrate that sucrose concentration takes precedence over warmth, so that when there is a difference in sucrose concentration, bees will typically choose the sweeter feeder, even if the less sweet feeder is several degrees warmer. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Pollination; Sensory ecology; Sensory integration; Sweetness detection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849138846

They may affect pollinator visitation rates to native plants and modify the plant-pollinator interaction network. However, there is little information about the extent to which invasive pollen is incorporated into the pollination network and about the rates of invasive pollen deposition on the stigmas of native plants. • Methods: The degree of pollinator sharing between the invasive plant Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and the main co-flowering native plants was tested in a Mediterranean coastal shrubland. Pollen loads were identified from the bodies of the ten most common pollinator species and stigmatic pollen deposition in the five most common native plant species. • Key Results: It was found that pollinators visited Carpobrotus extensively. Seventy-three per cent of pollinator specimens collected on native plants carried Carpobrotus pollen. On average 23% of the pollen on the bodies of pollinators visiting native plants was Carpobrotus. However, most of the pollen found on the body of pollinators belonged to the species on which they were collected. Similarly, most pollen on native plant stigmas was conspecific. Invasive pollen was present on native plant stigmas, but in low quantity. • Conclusions: Carpobrotusis highly integrated in the pollen transport network. However, the plant-pollination network in the invaded community seems to be sufficiently robust to withstand the impacts of the presence of alien pollen on native plant pollination, as shown by the low levels of heterospecific pollen deposition on native stigmas. Several mechanisms are discussed for the low invasive pollen deposition on native stigmas. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

Paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the Maya area have relied on the distribution of primarily wind borne pollen in ancient soil deposits, but the majority of these plants are pollinated biotically. An examination of the pollen syndromes of the dominant species of the Maya forest and the forest gardens demonstrates that only one of the dominant plants of the forest today appears in the pollen record of paleoenvironmental soil cores. In contrast, all the herbs and grasses of the high performance milpa, although dominated by maize, are in the pollen record.

The aim of the present research was to analyse the combined effect of the diversity and intermingling of clones on the rate of selfing in Vaccinium myrtillus. Four mother plants were selected within patches characterised by contrasting clonal structure (low versus high number and intermingling of clones). The selfing rate was significantly lower for plants situated within patches characterised by a high number of intermingled clones (3%) than for plants situated in patches with a low number of clones (50%). Therefore, for this species suffering from inbreeding depression, an increase in the number or the intermingling of the clones could reduce the rate and the cost of geitonogamy and allow a large floral display to attract pollinators. We also found that the main pollinators, bumblebee queens, presented a foraging behaviour favouring geitonogamy, as their successive visits to flowers were quite short (89% of flights were 40 cm or less). © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Bilberry; Clonal structure; Ericaceae; Geitonogamy; Outcrossing rate; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349098956

The irradiation effects on pollen grains were tested, considering the ultrastructural changes in the exine and interior walls of pollen grains, their germination rate, the growth speed of the pollen tubes in the style, fertilization and boll development after the pistils were pollinated by the pollen grains which had been implanted with nitrogen ions. Nitrogen ions entered the pollen grains by etching and penetrating the exine and interior walls and destroying cell structures. A greater percentage of the pollen grains were destroyed as the fluence of N+ ions increased. Obviously, the nitrogen ion beam penetrated the exine and interior walls of the pollen grains and produced holes of different sizes. As the ion fluence increased, the amount and the density of pollen grain inclusions decreased and the size of the lacuna and starch granules increased. Pollen grain germination rates decreased with increasing ion fluence. The number of pollen tubes in the style declined with increased ion implantation into pollen grains, but the growth speed of the tubes did not change. All of the pollen tubes reached the end of the style at 13 h after pollination. This result was consistent with that of the control. Also, the weight and the diameter of the ovary decreased and shortened with increased ion beam implantation fluence. No evident change in the fecundation time of the ovule was observed. These results indicate that nitrogen ions can enter pollen grains and cause a series of biological changes in pollen grains of upland cotton. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Section members readily hybridize in the glasshouse, but no hybrids have been observed in natural sympatric and parapatric populations. To investigate interspecific crossing relationships with respect to mechanisms preventing hybridization, all members of section Alatae were intercrossed in a complete diallel. We found positive correlation between the pistil length of the pollen donor and interspecific seed set relative to the conspecific cross. Pollen tube growth rate and pollen donor pistil length were positively correlated as well. Furthermore, pollen from short-pistil members of section Alatae could only grow a maximum distance proportional to, but greater than, their own pistil lengths. Our results show that pollen tube growth capacity (i.e., rate and distance), provides a hybridization barrier in long-pistil species × short-pistil species crosses. We also found another hybridization barrier not specifically related to pollen tube growth capacity in short-pistil species × long-pistil species. Taken together, these barriers can generally be described by a 'pistil-length mismatch' rule; in section Alatae, pollen has the most success fertilizing ovules from species with pistil lengths similar to their own. This rule could contribute to hybridization barriers in Section Alatae because the species display dramatically different pistil lengths. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Hybridization barriers; Nicotiana; Pistil length; Pollen tube growth rates; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349102772

The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of management practices on the relationship between crop yields and precipitation and crop yields and topography using 10 yr of yield data from a long-term corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation experiment in southwest Michigan. The four agronomic treatments studied were chisel plowed with conventional chemical inputs (CT), no-till with conventional chemical inputs (NT), chisel plowed with low chemical input and a winter leguminous cover crop (CTL), and organic-based chisel plowed with a winter leguminous cover crop (CTO). A nonparametric (spline) regression was used to characterize the relationship between the maximal yields, as characteristics of yield potential, and a wetness index (WI), as an integrative characteristic of topographical features related to water flow, and to compare the yield differences between the treatments across a range of the WI values. Variability of yields in NT and CTO systems was better explained by precipitation in early spring and during pollination and grain fill than that in CT and CTL. No-till and CTL tended to produce higher maximal yields than CT at the summit/steep-sloped areas (lower WI), while at intermediate and high WI levels the differences between them were inconsistent. The CTL often produced higher maximal yields than CTO at low and intermediate WI values, while the difference between them was mostly not significant at high WI levels (depression areas). The nonparametric spline regression algorithm used in the study was robust and efficient in comparing the yield differences between treatments across a range of WI values.

These phenotypes are similar to those of the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) classmutants, mea, fis2, fie, and Atmsi1, which also show development of the central cell into endosperm in the absence of fertilization and arrest of the embryo following fertilization. Atubp26 results from a T-DNA insertion in the UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE gene AtUBP26, which catalyzes deubiquitination of histone H2B and is required for heterochromatin silencing. The paternal copy of AtUBP26 is able to complement the loss of function of the maternal copy in postfertilization seed development. This contrasts to the fis classmutants where the paternal FIS copy does not rescue aborted seeds. As in the fis class mutants, the Polycomb group (PcG) complex target gene PHERES1 (PHE1) is expressed at higher levels in Atubp26 ovules than in wild type; there is a lower level of H3K27me3 at the PHE1 locus.

Field research was conducted at four North Dakota locations in 1999, 2000, and 2001 evaluating a small-seeded open-pollinated (OP) and a large-seeded hybrid (HYB) cultivar at two seeding depths (19 and 38 mm) both at four seeding rates (54, 108, 162, and 216) pure live seed (PLS) m-2. Percent emergence and plant density was significantly greater at the 19-mm seeding depth compared with the 38-mm seeding depth at six of eight environments. Seeding depth effect on seed yield was inconsistent among environments. Seed yield increased with increasing seeding rates in all but two environments. Hybrid and OP cultivars responded similarly to seeding rate for all characteristics measured, except days to first flower and net economic return per hectare. The net economic return per hectare, based on seed cost and grain value where HYB seed typically costs twice that of OP, was greatest at seeding rates for the large-seeded HYB at 108 PLS m-2, and at 162 PLS m-2 for the small-seeded OP cultivar. The HYB cultivar had a 24% greater seed yield than the OP cultivar and a 14% greater net economic return per hectare.

We have addressed both issues for four closely related plant species of the adaptive radiation Bromeliaceae, Alcantarea imperialis, A. geniculata, A. regina and A. glaziouana. All four are adapted to ancient, isolated inselberg rock outcrops in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest and are thus long-term fragmented by nature. We used eight nuclear microsatellites to study within-population spatial genetic structure (SGS) and historical gene dispersal in nine populations of these species. Within-population SGS reflected known between-species differences in mating systems. The strongest SGS observed in A. glaziouana (Sp = 0.947) was stronger than literature estimates available for plants. Analysis of short- and long-distance components of SGS identified biparental inbreeding, selfing and restricted seed dispersal as main determinants of SGS, with restricted pollen dispersal by bats contributing in some localities. The ability of Alcantarea spp. to colonize isolated inselbergs probably stems from their flexible mating systems and an ability to tolerate inbreeding. Short-ranging gene dispersal (average sigma = 7-27 m) is consistent with a loss of dispersal power in terrestrial island habitats. Population subdivision associated with sympatric colour morphs in A. imperialis is accompanied by between-morph differences in pollen and seed dispersal. Our results indicate a high potential for divergence with gene flow in inselberg bromeliads and they provide base-line data about the long-term effects of fragmentation in plants. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Alcantarea; Bromeliaceae; Colour morphs; Gene dispersal; Inselberg; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50049123244

Our review of published records and museum collections, combined with recent field surveys, yielded 388 verified, described bee species and additional morphospecies that await further analysis. Catalogued bee specimens have been collected from all 72 Wisconsin counties, although central and northern regions appear to be relatively under-sampled. Many of the species on the list have not previously been reported for Wisconsin, and nine of the newly reported species have not previously been documented from any adjacent state. At least 191 bee species known from Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, or Indiana have never been documented in Wisconsin, suggesting that our list of Wisconsin bee species is far from complete. We describe geographic affinities of Wisconsin's bee fauna and discuss changes in populations of several species over the past century. Regional extirpations, population declines, and establishment of exotic bees in the state are poorly known and will require significantly more attention if we hope to effectively conserve Wisconsin s native bees and their pollination services.

A GFP gene was introduced into the tobacco genome using the Bar gene as a linked selectable marker flanked by recombination sites in a directed orientation. The Bar gene expression box was subsequently excised from the plant genome by a strategy of Cre gene retransformation. After removal of the Cre-NPT II locus by genetic segregation through self-cross, plants that incorporated only the GFP transgene were obtained. Transgenic tobacco plants mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens were obtained, which resisted herbicide Basta and GFP expressed well, then the Cre gene was subsequently introduced into 5 plants of them, respectively, by retransformation. The leaf disks from Cre transgenic plants were used to test the resistance to Basta on the medium with 8 mg L-1 of PPT. The results showed that few discs were able to regenerate normally, and the excision at 76-100% efficiency depended on individual retransformation events. Evidence for a precise recombination event was confirmed by cloning the nucleotides sequence surrounding the lox sites of the Basta sensitive plants. The result indicated that the excision event in the recombination sites was precise and conservative, without loss or alteration of any submarginal nucleotides of the recombination sites. Bar gene excised plants were self-pollinated to allow segregation of the GFP gene from the Cre-NPT II locus. The progenies from self-pollinated plants were scored for Kan senstivity, then the segregation of GFP gene from Cre-NPT II locus in the Kan senstive plants were confirmed by PCR analysis subsequently. Hence, constructing marker-free transgenic tobacco plants by Cre/lox site-specific recombination system was reliable, and the strategy presented here should be applicable to other plants for the construction of marker-free transgenic plants as well. © 2008 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",Cre/lox site-specific recombination system; GFP; marker-free transgenic tobacco,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52149099457

In this study, we investigated the role of free IAA in pollen-pistil interactions during pollen germination and tube growth in Nicotiana tabacum L. through using histo and subcellular immunolocalization with auxin monoclonal antibodies, quantification by HPLC and ELISA together with GUS staining in DR5::GUS-transformed plants. The results showed that free IAA in unpollinated styles was higher in the apical part and basal part than in the middle part, and it was more abundant in the transmitting tissue (TT). At the stage of pollen germination, IAA reached its highest content in the stigma and was mainly distributed in TT. After the pollen tubes entered the styles, the signal increased in the part where pollen tubes would enter and then rapidly declined in the part where pollen tubes had penetrated. Subcellular localization confirmed the presence of IAA in TT cells of stigmas and styles. Accordingly, a schematic diagram summarizes the changing pattern of free IAA level during flowering, pollination and pollen tube growth. Furthermore, we presented evidence that low concentration of exogenous IAA could, to a certain extent, facilitate in vitro pollen tube growth. These results suggest that IAA may be directly or indirectly involved in the pollen-pistil interactions. Additionally, some improvements of the IAA immunolocalization technique were made. © Physiologia Plantarum 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749091742

An F2 mapping population of perennial ryegrass (VrnA), recently characterised for vernalisation response, was assessed in a glasshouse for traits related to seed yield based on a lattice design with four replications over 2 years. The traits heading date, plant height, length of panicles, number of panicles per plant, seed yield per panicle, flag leaf length, flag leaf width and seed yield per plant revealed repeatabilities ranging from 41 to 76% and a considerable amount of genetic variation in the VrnA population. Path analysis partitioned the direct and indirect effects of seed yield components on seed yield per plant. Seed yield per panicle showed the highest effect on total seed yield. The adjusted mean values of each trait and a genetic linkage map consisting of 97 anonymous and 85 gene associated DNA markers were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Of particular interest were two QTL on linkage group (LG) 1 and LG 2, explaining 41 and 18%, respectively, of the observed phenotypic variation for the trait seed yield per panicle. Both QTL co-located with two major QTL for total seed yield per plant possibly representing the S and Z loci of the gametophytic self incompatibility (SI) system of perennial ryegrass.

Previously, we cloned a pollen specific gene, zm401, from a cDNA library generated from the mature pollen of Zea mays. Expression of partial cDNA of zm401 in maize and ectopic expression of zm401 in tobacco suggested it may play a role in anther development. Here we present the expression and functional characterization of this pollen specific gene in maize. Zm401 is expressed primarily in the anthers (tapetal cells as well as microspores) in a developmentally regulated manner. That is, it is expressed from floret forming stage, increasing in concentration up to mature pollen. Knockdown of zm401 significantly affected the expression of ZmMADS2, MZm3-3, and ZmC5, critical genes for pollen development; led to aberrant development of the microspore and tapetum, and finally male-sterility. Zm401 possesses highly conserved sequences and evolutionary conserved stable RNA secondary structure in monocotyledon. These data show that zm401 could be one of the key growth regulators in anther development, and functions as a short-open reading-frame mRNA (sORF mRNA) and/or noncoding RNA (ncRNA). © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Anther; Development; Maize; Microspore; Tapetum; zm401,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849154682

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Primula elatior that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Primula elatior is a native perennial herb, within a compact area in the British Isles, in ancient woods and copses on the chalky boulder clay in East Anglia, where it is abundant locally although scarce nationally. British material is ssp. elatior, which extends across much of Europe, becoming rarer towards the south. 3. Primula elatior is a shade tolerant species, but only flowers in profusion in the increased light levels following tree felling in traditionally coppiced woods. It is confined to an area of the British Isles where the soils are seasonally waterlogged and ill-aerated, and is very tolerant of the toxic levels of ferrous iron which accumulate in the surface horizons in the spring months. It has a poorly developed drought tolerance. 4. An early flowering plant, P. elatior is an insect-pollinated obligate outbreeder, with two self-incompatible morphs (pin and thrum). The low colonizing ability of this ancient woodland species can be attributed to both seed dispersal and seedling recruitment limitation. 5. There has been a steady reduction in the density of P. elatior in woodland sites during the past centuries. However, there has been little change in the 10-km distribution in the British Isles. Studies of populations involve three groups of factors: genetic variation, environmental changes and population structure. Potentially these factors have a greater effect on small and isolated populations than on large and integrated ones. There is no evidence that the species suffers from a loss of genetic diversity in the smaller populations. Primula elatior seems to have a relatively high level of genetic diversity that is maintained despite a fragmented distribution. Within its restricted distribution area P. elatior replaces P. vulgaris completely. At the margins of their distributions the two species occur together in a number of woodland sites, providing the opportunity for hybridization. As they are highly interfertile, hybridization is restricted mainly by differences in their habitat preferences. The hybrid P. vulgaris × P. elatior = P. × digenea is fertile and gives rise to hybrid swarms which are found in all British sites where both parents occur together. Changes in climate, woodland management practices and intensities of deer grazing, especially by Fallow deer (Dama dama), are likely to have a major effect on populations of P. elatior. Since the species colonizes new or secondary woodlands very slowly, management should focus on the conservation of ancient semi-natural woodlands. © 2008 Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",Conservation; Ecophysiology; Genetic variation; Germination; Herbivory; Reproductive biology; Restricted distribution; Soils; Woodland communities,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649104287

The results from seven natural populations indicated that the seed sets of hermaphrodite ramets were relatively stable compared to those of female ramets. However, a negative correlation was detected between the seed set of female ramets and their frequency of occurrence in a population. Moreover, a negative correlation was also detected between the degree of gender modification in the late flowering period and the seed set in female ramets. Controlled experiments on both wild and cultivated plants indicated that the resource adjustment, presumably caused by flower removal or the hand pollination of flowers, in the early-middle flowering season could induce a greater degree of gender modification in later flowers from female to hermaphrodite and vice versa. However, the ranges of degree of gender modification were different between the two sex morphs, and the variation in females was greater than in hermaphrodites. This phenomenon could not be adequately explained based on the sequential adjustment of investment hypothesis which has been invoked in previous studies. We propose that the results of this study may provide a variation to the model of sequential adjustment of investment in serial flowering annual gynodioecious plants, including Glechoma longituba. We postulate that the variation of sex expression might be beneficial for the female in order to avoid pollen limitation and, further, to obtain a selective advantage. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Glechoma longituba; Gynodioecious; Sequential adjustment of investment; Sex expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50649113463

The search for characteristics that promote invasion success constitutes one of the most challenging tasks in invasion ecology. So far the main focus in multispecies studies of plant invasion success has been on single traits. Only few generalizations have emerged from this work and single traits yielded very limited explanatory power for invasion success. Here we hypothesize that the consideration of ecological strategies, determined by different combinations of traits, will improve explanatory power. 2. To test this hypothesis we analysed the relative importance of 40 traits for species' invasion success in the German neophytic flora. Success was expressed as map grid cell frequency. After quantifying the relevance of single traits, we quantified the importance of different trait combinations for invasion success by calculating a multiple trait model, with explicit consideration of trait interactions. In all analyses we considered the effects of phylogeny. 3. In general, neither single traits nor phylogenetic relatedness held much explanatory power. In contrast, the amount of variation explained in the multiple trait model was distinctly higher, mainly due to the incorporation of trait interactions. Thus, particular combinations of trait attributes rather than distinctive attributes per se appear to be associated with invasion success. 4. In single trait analysis, traits associated with flowering and reproductive biology, and with ecological tolerance and the residence time of the species were significantly associated with invasion success. Multiple trait analysis revealed that the relationship between the length of flowering season and invasion success was contingent upon pollination modes. Moreover, the success of polyploids and of species with certain vegetative reproductive trait attributes depended on the species' flowering phenology. 5. Synthesis. Our results indicate that different ecological strategies, determined by particular combinations of traits, can facilitate plant invasion success. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating trait interactions when testing for characteristics that promote plant invasion success. Improved explanatory power of traits suggests that our new approach can provide an important step forward in the risk assessment and management of new arrivals in regional floras. © 2008 The Authors.",Life-history traits; Macroecology; Non-indigenous plant species; Phylogenetic effects; Plant ecological strategies; Single traits; Trait combinations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649126152

To initiate a selective breeding program, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to estimate genetic diversity within the Norwegian R. rosea germplasm collection. AFLP analysis of 97 R. rosea clones using five primer combinations gave a total of 109 polymorphic bands. We detected high percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) with a mean of 82.3% among the clones of R. rosea. Each of the 97 R. rosea clones could be unambiguously identified based on these primer combinations. Estimates of genetic similarities were obtained by the Dice coefficient, and a final dendrogram was constructed with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Genetic similarity based on the AFLP data ranged from 0.440 to 0.950 with a mean of 0.631. This genetic analysis showed that there was no close genetic similarity among clones related to their original growing county. No gender-specific markers were found in the R. rosea clones. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a significantly greater variation within regions (92.03%) than among regions (7.97%). A low level of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.043) was observed, indicating a high level of gene flow, which had a strong influence on the genetic structure at different counties. Our results indicate high gene flow among R. rosea clones that might be a result of seed dispersal rather than cross-pollination. Further world-wide studies are required to compare the level of genetic diversity and more studies in R. rosea detailing the consequences of different patterns of gene flow (pollen spread and dispersal of seeds and clonal plants) will be useful for characterization of roseroot. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cleistogamy is a mating system found in approximately 300 species of flowering plants. Cleistogamous plants produce closed (cleistogamous, CL) flowers that require obligate self-pollination and open (chasmogamous, CH) flowers that allow for outcross-pollination. CL and CH flowers are induced by various environmental factors; this appears to be an adaptive mating strategy in unpredictable environments. 2. We examined the molecular basis of CL and CH flowering in Cardamine kokaiensis, which is closely related to the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. CL and CH flowering should be regulated by gene expression that is dependent on environmental conditions. By elucidating the molecular basis of CL and CH flowering, we can determine the changes in gene regulatory networks involved in the transition from CH to CL flowering. Furthermore, these results may help clarify the molecular evolutionary mechanisms leading to cleistogamy. 3. We regulated CL and CH flowering of C. kokaiensis using chilling treatments in a growth chamber. In a control treatment without chilling, C. kokaiensis produced CH and intermediate (INT) flowers. Long chilling of seedlings led to INT flowers, while long chilling of seeds induced the formation of CL flowers. Chilling seeds, and to a lesser extent of seedlings, induced early flowering and small plant size at flowering. 4. We also conducted a cross-species microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns between CL and CH flowers using genomic DNA-based probe-selection strategy in an A. thaliana microarray. In this result, 69 genes, including genes related to floral development, auxin, flowering time, cold-stress, and drought-stress, were differentially expressed between CL and CH flowers. 5. Synthesis. This is the first report on the molecular basis of cleistogamy. We hypothesize that the interaction between the genetic network of the chilling response and that of floral development has been important in the evolution of cleistogamy in C. kokaiensis.

In earlier work with experimental wheat (Triticum aestivum) populations at a single density, we found that stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) created frequency-dependent selection on its host but competitive interactions between host genotypes reduced the potential for disease to maintain genetic polymorphisms in this highly self-pollinated species; the weaker competitor actually exhibited positive disease-mediated frequency-dependent selection. Based on these results we predicted that at low density, where the overall level of competition is lower, disease would have a stronger impact relative to competition and thus be more likely to maintain genetic polymorphisms; at low densities the greatest effect of disease for negative frequency-dependent selection should be seen in the weak competitor. Here we report on results with wheat stripe rust in which we altered both the frequency and density of host genotypes in factorial combinations of two-way mixtures where each host genotype was attacked by its own specialized race of rust. Within each density disease levels increased with genotype frequencies, creating frequency-dependent disease attack at all densities. Similarly, disease created negative frequency-dependent selection on its host at all densities, as a genotype's fitness was often greater at low than high frequency when disease was present. Disease levels increased with plant density in 1997 but decreased in 1998. While increasing plant density reduced absolute fitness, presumably as a result of increased competition, a genetic polymorphism was not more likely to be maintained at low than high density as we had predicted. Within each density, the impact of disease was insufficient to reverse the slope of the relationship between absolute fitness and planted frequency from positive to negative for the less competitive host genotype, thus preventing the maintenance of a genetic polymorphism. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Competition; Disease; Frequency-dependent selection; Gene-for-gene; Red Queen hypothesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50249095839

Prominent Omp85 proteins in bacteria and mitochondria mediate biogenesis of other ?-barrel proteins and are indispensable for viability. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chloroplasts, there are two distinct types of Omp85-related protein: Toc75 (Translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts, 75 kD) and OEP80 (Outer Envelope Protein, 80 kD). Toc75 functions as a preprotein translocation channel during chloroplast import, but the role of OEP80 remains elusive. We characterized three T-DNA mutants of the Arabidopsis OEP80 (AtOEP80) gene. Selectable markers associated with the oep80-1 and oep80-2 insertions segregated abnormally, suggesting embryo lethality of the homozygous genotypes. Indeed, no homozygotes were identified among >100 individuals, and heterozygotes of both mutants produced approximately 25% aborted seeds upon self-pollination. Embryo arrest occurred at a relatively late stage (globular embryo proper) as revealed by analysis using Nomarski optics microscopy. This is substantially later than arrest caused by loss of the principal Toc75 isoform, atToc75-III (two-cell stage), suggesting a more specialized role for AtOEP80. Surprisingly, the oep80-3 T-DNA (located in exon 1 between the first and second ATG codons of the open reading frame) did not cause any detectable developmental defects or affect the size of the AtOEP80 protein in chloroplasts. This indicates that the N-terminal region of AtOEP80 is not essential for the targeting, biogenesis, or functionality of the protein, in contrast with atToc75-III, which requires a bipartite targeting sequence. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55549098175

Forensic palynology is discussed with reference to other forensic disciplines to help understand what is required for its progress. Emerging developments are also discussed. Palynomorphs potentially deliver excellent trace evidence, fulfilling the requirements relating to the transfer, persistence, and detection of such evidence. Palynological evidence can provide very powerful investigative and associative evidence. Despite this, the application of palynology to forensic science has had mixed success. There are many anecdotal stories where pollen evidence has had spectacular successes. But it is extremely underutilized in most countries because it is labor-intensive and requires considerable expertise and experience, there is a lack of control over sample collection and inadequate resourcing and funding, and its crime-solving power is not well known. Palynology has been applied to forensic problems in an unstructured way, resulting in a lack of formalized discussion of the underlying principles. As there is renewed questioning of the acceptability of most evidence types in the current legal environment, there is a need for the establishment of palynological evidence through validation-type studies and experimentation, and the implementation of independent proficiency testing. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Forensic palynology; Forensic science; Pollen and spores; Trace evidence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51349154293

This trait is present in several plant families and is strongly associated with polyploidy. Paspalum rufum is a forage grass with sexual self-incompatible diploids (2n = 2x = 20) and aposporous-apomictic pseudogamous tetraploids (2n = 4x = 40). In previous work embryological observations of the diploid genotype Q3754 showed 8.8-26.8% of the ovaries having one meiotic plus an aposporous-like embryo sac, suggesting some capability for apomictic reproduction. The objective of this work was to characterize progenies derived from Q3754 to determine if aposporous sacs were functional and generated progenies via apomixis at the diploid level. Re-examination of Q3754 ovaries showed that 12.5% of them contained one sexual plus an aposporous sac confirming previous results. Progeny tests were carried out on two experimental families (H 1 and S1) employing heterozygous RAPD marker loci. Family H1 was obtained crossing Q3754 with a natural diploid genotype (Q3861) and S1 derived from the induced self-pollination of Q3754. Genetic analysis of H1 showed that all individuals derived from sexual reproduction. However, 5 out of 95 plants from S1 showed the same heterozygous state as the mother plant for 14 RAPD loci suggesting a clonal origin. Further experiments, designed to test the functionality of aposporous sacs by flow cytometric analyses, were carried out on a third family (M 1) obtained by crossing Q3754 with the tetraploid plant Q3785. Histograms of 20 M1 plants showed 15 diploids (75%), 4 triploids (20%) and 1 tetraploid (5%). Triploids and the tetraploid may have originated from functional aposporous embryo sacs. Likewise, the reconstruction of the developmental route of 40 individual seeds demonstrated that 11 of them (27.5%) derived from fertilized aposporic sacs. The results presented in this work indicate that gametophytic apomixis is effectively expressed at the diploid level in Paspalum rufum and could be the foundation of a recurrent auto-polyploidization process in the species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Apospory; Flow cytometric analysis; Paspalum rufum; Progeny test; RAPD markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349089750

Previous work on the distylous perennial herb Pulmonaria officinalis, however, showed asymmetric mating between floral morphs and a weak self-incompatibility system, with the long-styled morph (L-morph) producing significantly higher seed set following intramorph crosses and even selfing than the short-styled morph (S-morph), two aspects thought to affect female fecundity and morph-ratio variation. Here, we evaluated morph ratios and population size of all known P. officinalis populations in the northern part of Belgium. Morph ratios deviated significantly from 1 : 1 (range 0.09-1 L-morph frequency, mean = 0.58). Relative fecundity of the S-morph (i.e. mean seed set of the S-morph/mean seed set of the L-morph) was on average 0.73, was positively related to the frequency of the L-morph, and reached 1 (similar levels of female fecundity) at an average L-morph frequency of 0.66 in the population. As some small populations had the S-morph in majority, our results suggest that local morph ratios are influenced both by the relative fecundity of L- and S-morph individuals and by stochastic processes in small populations. © 2008 The Authors.",Disassortative mating; Frequency-dependent reproduction; Legitimate pollination; Lungwort; Morph bias; Pollen limitation; Sexual polymorphism; Weak incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549111762

The ratio of sucrose-derived hexoses, fructose and glucose, in the floral nectar of Anigozanthos flavidus (Haemodoraceae) was observed to be different from 1:1, which cannot be explained by the simple action of invertases. Various NMR techniques were used to investigate how such an unbalanced ratio of the two nectar hexoses can be formed. High-resolution 13C NMR spectroscopy in solution was used to determine the proportion of carbohydrates in vascular bundles of excised inflorescences fed with 13C-labelled carbohydrates. These experiments verified that feeding did not affect the metabolic processes involved in nectar formation. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. cyclic J cross-polarization) was used to detect carbohydrates in vascular bundles and 1H spin echo imaging non-invasively displayed the architecture of tepal nectaries and showed how they are connected to the vascular bundles. A model of the carbohydrate metabolism involved in forming A. flavidus floral nectar was established. Sucrose from the vascular bundles is not directly secreted into the lumen of the nectary but, either before or after invertase-catalysed hydrolyses, taken up by nectary cells and cycled at least partly through glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Secretion of the two hexoses in the cytosolic proportion could elegantly explain the observed fructose:glucose ratio of the nectar. © 2008 The Author(s).",13C chemical shift imaging; Anigozanthos flavidus; Carbohydrate transport; Cryo probe; Floral nectar; Haemodoraceae; Microimaging; MRI; NMR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51749099025

The Hieracium genus contains apomictic species that form viable seeds asexually. To investigate FIS function during apomictic seed formation, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), encoding a WD-repeat member of the FIS complex, was isolated and downregulated in sexual and apomictic Hieracium species. General downregulation led to defects in leaf and seed development, consistent with a role in developmental transitions and cell fate. PcG-like activity of Hieracium FIE was also supported by its interaction in vitro with the Arabidopsis CURLY LEAF PcG protein. By contrast, specific downregulation of FIE in developing seeds of sexual Hieracium did not result in autonomous endosperm proliferation but led to seed abortion after cross-pollination. Furthermore, in apomictic Hieracium, specific FIE downregulation inhibited autonomous embryo and endosperm initiation, and most autonomous seeds displayed defective embryo and endosperm growth. Therefore, FIE is required for both apomictic and fertilization-induced seed initiation in Hieracium. Since Hieracium FIE failed to interact with FIS class proteins in vitro, its partner proteins might differ from those in the FIS complex of Arabidopsis. These differences in protein interaction were attributed to structural modifications predicted from comparisons of Arabidopsis and Hieracium FIE molecular models. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57749117251

A total of 169 transcripts displaying an allele-specific expression profile were identified. Several of these transcripts displayed homology to genes involved in general cellular functions. In other cases, interesting homologies to proteins, such as kinases, known to be involved in SI in other plant families were found. A genome-wide expression analysis, on the other hand, allowed us to identify 515 transcript derived fragments as putatively related to SI in L. perenne. All the expression profiles were quantified using AFLP-QuantarPro™ and clustered using hierarchical and AQBC clustering methods. A subset of these genes was selected for sequencing and assigned into 10 functional categories. Homologies were found to proteins known to be involved in fertilization and SI processes in other plant families such as ubiquitin-related and calcium-related proteins. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cluster; Functional category; Self-incompatibility; Transcript derived fragment (TDF),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249083837

In the first experiment, 372 wide hybridization combinations were done by crossing 196 T. turgidum lines belonging to seven subspecies with 13 Ae. tauschii accessions. Without embryo rescue and hormone treatment, from the 66220 florets pollinated, 3713 seeds were obtained, with a mean crossability percentages of 5.61% which ranged from 0 to 75%. A lot of hybrid seeds could germinate and produce plants. Out of 372 combinations, 73.12% showed a very low crossability less than 5%, 23.39% showed the crossability of 5-30%, 2.69% showed the crossability of 30-50%, 0.81% showed high crossability more than 50%, respectively. Among the seven T. turgidum subspecies, there were significant differences in crossability. The ssp. dicoccoides and dicoccon showed the highest crossability, while polonicum the lowest. All the crossability percentages more than 30% were obtained from the crossing of ssp. dicoccoides or dicoccon with Ae. tauschii. In the second experiment, the genetics of crossability was investigated using T. turgidum ssp. durum cultivar Langdon and the D-genome disomic substitution lines of Langdon. Compared with the control Langdon, lines 7D(7A) and 4D(4B) showed higher crossability, which suggested that chromosomes 7A and 4B of tetraploid wheat cv. Langdon carried dominant alleles inhibiting crossability with Ae. tauschii. The relationships of present results with previously reported crossability genes of wheat are discussed. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.",Aegilops tauschii; Aneuploid analysis; Crossability; Triticum turgidum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53749084256

This article reports on an induced mutation in this crop, first identified in 2006. Botanical seed from five different cassava families were irradiated with ? rays. Seed was germinated, transplanted to the field (M1 plants), and self-pollinated to produce the M2 generation. Abnormal types regarding starch granule morphology were identified during the single plant evaluation of M2 genotypes. To confirm these characteristics, selected genotypes were cloned and a second evaluation, based on cloned plants obtained from vegetative multiplication, was completed in September 2007. Two M2 genotypes presented small starch granules, but only one could be fully characterized, presenting a granule size of 5.80 ± 0.33 ?m compared with three commercial clones with granule sizes ranging from 13.97 ± 0.12 to 18.73 ± 0.10 ?m and higher-than-normal amylose content (up to 30.1% in cloned plants harvested in 2007, as compared with the typical values for ""normal"" cassava starch of around 19.8%). The gels produced by the starch of these plants did not show any viscosity when analyzed with the rapid viscoanalyzers (5% suspension), and the gels had low clarity. Low viscosity could be observed at higher concentrations (8 or 10% suspensions).

Seed yield from plots where insect visitors had access to and where they were denied access was compared. The proportional difference of yield from this pollination scenario was used to estimate monetary net-gain by farmers that could be attributed to insect pollination. In total, individuals belonging to 14 insect species were observed visiting sunflower floral heads. These included six Lepidopteran species, five Hymenopteran species, two Dipteran species, and one Coleopteran species. Apis mellifera L. was the most frequent visitor and had the highest pollination efficiency index. Plots where insect visitors had access produced on average 53% more seed yield compared with plots where insect visitors were excluded.

However, little is known about their effects on gene flow via pollen dispersal between populations of these species. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a 2-year experiment, we observed effective pollen dispersal from source populations of Centaurea jacea in restored meadows, the most widespread Swiss agri-environment scheme, to potted plants in adjacent intensively managed meadows without other individuals of this species. Potted plants were put in replicated source populations at 25, 50, 100 m and where possible 200 m distance from these source populations. Pollen transfer among isolated plants was prevented by temporary bagging, such that only one isolated plant was accessible for flower visitors at any one time. Because C. jacea is self-incompatible, seed set in single-plant isolates indicated insect mediated effective pollen dispersal from the source population. Seed set was higher in source populations (35.7±4.4) than in isolates (4.8±1.0). Seed set declined from 18.9% of that in source populations at a distance of 25 m to 7.4% at 200 m. At a distance of 200 m seed set was still significantly higher in selfed plants, indicating long-distance effective pollen dispersal up to 200 m. Analyses of covariance suggested that bees contributed more than flies to this long-distance pollen dispersal. We found evidence that pollen dispersal to single-plant isolates was positively affected by the diversity and flower abundance of neighboring plant species in the intensively managed meadow. Furthermore, the decline of the dispersal was less steep when the source population of C. jacea was large. Conclusions: We conclude that insect pollinators can effectively transfer pollen from source populations of C. jacea over at least 200 m, even when ""recipient populations"" consisted of single-plant isolates, suggesting that gene flow by pollen over this distance is very likely. Source population size and flowering environment surrounding recipient plants appear to be important factors affecting pollen dispersal in C. jacea. It is conceivable that most insect-pollinated plants in a network of restored sites within intensively managed grassland can form metapopulations, if distances between sites are of similar magnitude as tested here. © 2009 Albrecht et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849092404

Populations usually contain 3 floral morphs that differ reciprocally in style length and anther height (referred to as the long-, mid-, and short-styled morphs, hereafter L-, M-, and S-morphs). The floral polymorphism promotes disassortative mating among the 3 floral morphs and is maintained in populations by negative frequency-dependent selection. The objective of this study was to determine the number of loci, number of alleles, and gene action controlling floral morph in pickerelweed. Three parental lines (one each of the L-, M-, and S-morph) were used to create S1 and F1 populations. F2 populations were produced through self-pollination of F1 plants. Progeny ratios of S1, F1, and F2 generations revealed that tristyly is controlled by 2 diallelic loci (S and M) with dominant gene action. The S locus is epistatic to the M locus, with the S-morph produced by plants with the dominant S allele (genotype S _ _ _). Plants with recessive alleles at the S locus were either L-morph (ssmm) or M-morph (ssM_).

A recent model shows that, in the presence of pollinators with long and short tongues that experience resource competition, coexisting plant species can diverge in corolla-tube depth, because this increases the proportion of pollen grains that lands on co-specific flowers. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have extended the model to study whether resource competition can trigger the co-evolution of tongue length and corolla-tube depth. Starting with two plant and two pollinator species, all of them having the same distribution of tongue length or corolla-tube depth we show that variability in coralla-tube depth leads to divergence in tongue length, provided that increasing tounge length is not equally costly for both species. Once the two pollinator species differ in tongue length, divergence in corolla-tube depth between the two plant species ensues. Conclusions/Significance: Co-evolution between tongue length and corolla-tube depth is a robust outcome of the model, obtained for a wide range of parameter values, but it requires that tongue elongation is substantially easier for one pollinator species than for the other, that pollinators follow a near-optimal foraging strategy, that pollinators experience competition for resources and that plants experience pollination limitation. © 2008 Rodriguez-Girones et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-52049103848

Nonetheless, use of hybrid seeds is widespread. The first pearl millet hybrids were introduced in 1965 by the public sector. Yet, starting in the late 1980s, market liberalisation led to an increasing role of private companies in seed development and distribution. Although several studies showed that proprietary pearl millet hybrids are more productive than public hybrids and open-pollinated varieties, the impacts of privatisation on farmers' technology access and overall innovation rates are not yet well understood. This paper analyses the dynamics of adoption using duration models and farm survey data collected in the state of Maharashtra. The results show that education, short distances to main information sources and good market infrastructure speeded up the adoption of pearl millet hybrids. Likewise, the increasing role of private seed companies had a positive and accelerating effect on technology diffusion in the small farm sector. © Journal compilation © 2008 The Agricultural Economics Society.",Adoption; Duration analysis; Hybrid seeds; India; Pearl millet; Seed market liberalisation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48949088070

Since that time a number of key life history and morphological traits have been proposed as developmental correlates of the extraordinary diversity and ecological success of angiosperms. Here, I identify several innovations that were fundamental to the evolutionary lability of angiosperm reproduction, and hence to their diversification. In gymnosperms pollen reception must be near the egg largely because sperm swim or are transported by pollen tubes that grow at very slow rates (< ?20 ?m/h). In contrast, pollen tube growth rates of taxa in ancient angiosperm lineages (Amborella, Nuphar, and Austrobaileya) range from ?80 to 600 ?m/h. Comparative analyses point to accelerated pollen tube growth rate as a critical innovation that preceded the origin of the true closed carpel, long styles, multiseeded ovaries, and, in monocots and eudicots, much faster pollen tube growth rates. Ancient angiosperm pollen tubes all have callosic walls and callose plugs (in contrast, no gymnosperms have these features). The early association of the callose-walled growth pattern with accelerated pollen tube growth rate underlies a striking repeated pattern of faster and longer-distance pollen tube growth often within solid pathways in phylogenetically derived angiosperms. Pollen tube innovations are a key component of the spectacular diversification of carpel (flower and fruit) form and reproductive cycles in flowering plants. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Evo-devo; Heterochrony; Key innovation; Modularity; Origin of angiosperms,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649094061

However, few empirical studies have been carried out at both the flowering and fruiting stages to adequately address size-dependent sex allocation in cosexual plants. In this paper, we investigated resource investment between female and male reproduction, and their size-dependence in a perennial andromonoecious herb, Veratrum nigrum L. We sampled 192 flowering plants, estimated their standardized phenotypic gender, and assessed the resource investment in male and female functions in terms of absolute dry biomass. At the flowering stage, male investment increased with plant size more rapidly than female investment, and the standardized phenotypic femaleness (ranging from 0.267 to 0.776) was negatively correlated with plant size. By contrast, female biased allocation was found at the fruiting stage, although both flower biomass and fruit biomass were positively correlated with plant size. We propose that increased maleness with plant size at the flowering stage may represent an adaptive strategy for andromonoecious plants, because male flowers promote both male and female fertility by increasing pollinator attraction without aggravating pollen discounting. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Andromonoecy; Phenotypic gender; Size-dependent sex allocation; Veratrum nigrum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749093679

The genetic material included seedlings of open pollinated families, ramets of selected clones within them and seedlings of common black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) as a control. Both seedlings and ramets were planted in the field in April 1994. At the end of the first and the subsequent growing seasons (1994-2002) all of them were cut at 20 cm aboveground. Measurements were done at the end of October-beginning of November and included height and oven-dry weight of saplings, stem number, leaf/stem ratio of oven-dry weight and length of the longest thorn. It was found that height and oven-dry weight were increased in the first three years but they declined thereafter both in clones and families. Overall, however, clones were superior to families. Stem number was increased with age more in families than in clones. Leaf/stem ratio of oven-dry weight declined with time but clones were superior to families. Thorn length, finally, increased over the years but clones had significantly lower values than families. The results showed that the most productive clones were also better in quality characteristics (leaf/stem ratio of oven-dry weight and thorn length) than most families and the control.

Gender-biased nectar, for example, could be maintained by one or both, depending on the interactions between plants and pollinators. Here, I investigate pollinator responses to gender-biased nectar using the dichogamous herb Chrysothemis friedrichsthaliana (Gesneriaceae) which produces more nectar during the male floral phase. Previous research showed that the hummingbird pollinator Phaethornis striigularis visited male-phase flowers more often than female-phase flowers, and multiple visits benefited male more than female fecundity. If sexual selection maintains male-biased rewards, hummingbirds should prefer more-rewarding flowers independent of floral gender. If, however, differential rewards are partially maintained through natural selection, hummingbirds should respond to asymmetry with visits that reduce geitonogamy, i.e. selfing and pollen discounting. In plants with male biases, these visit types include single-flower visits and movements from low to high rewards. To test these predictions, I manipulated nectar asymmetry between pairs of real or artificial flowers on plants and recorded foraging behaviour. I also assessed maternal costs of selfing using hand pollinations. For plants with real flowers, hummingbirds preferred more-rewarding flowers and male-phase morphology, the latter possibly owing to previous experience. At artificial arrays, hummingbirds responded to extreme reward asymmetry with increased single-flower visits; however, they moved from high to low rewards more often than low to high. Finally, selfed flowers did not produce inferior seeds. In summary, sexual selection, more so than geitonogamy avoidance, maintains nectar biases in C. friedrichsthaliana, in one of the clearest examples of sexual selection in plants, to date. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Chrysothemis friedrichsthaliana; Floral evolution; Hummingbird pollination; Nectar; Phaethornis striigularis; Sexual selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45249107980

Progeny sex ratios modulated by environmental conditions is one of the most radical ways in which offspring quality may be influenced, yet it has rarely been reported in plants. A mechanism proposed to influence progeny sex ratios in dioecious plants involves competition between female- and male-determining microgametophytes (certation) as a result of variation in pollination intensity. However, the role of selective fertilization in dioecious plants is controversial and has not been demonstrated under field conditions. Here we investigate whether natural variation in the spatial arrangement of females and males influences pollination intensity and progeny sex ratios in the wind-pollinated herb Rumex nivalis. Based on previous experimental manipulation of pollination intensity in this species, we predicted that maternal parents in close proximity to males would produce more strongly female-biased progeny sex ratios. We tested this prediction in six alpine populations in Switzerland by measuring the distance between focal females and neighboring males and assessing pollen loads and seed sex ratios of maternal parents. In four of the six populations, females positioned in close proximity to males captured more pollen and exhibited more female-biased sex ratios. Our results demonstrate that demographic aspects of the maternal mating environment can influence progeny sex ratios. The most probable explanation for biased primary sex ratios in Rumex is selective fertilization resulting from pollen tube competition. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Female-biased sex ratios; Pollination intensity; Selective fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49449117835

Two populations derived from single-cross commercial hybrids and currently in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (1 and 2) were used for these experiments. Initially 169 half-sib progenies were obtained from each population. All progenies were sown in two isolated fields. The pollinator from one field was population 1 and the pollinator was the opposite population on the other field, all developed under similar conditions. The ears harvested by hand, in both isolated fields were bulked, resulting in a ""half-sib progeny bulk"". This seed production method produced an adequate quantity of same-age-seed of each intra and inter progenies to use in the seed quality tests. The seed produced was initially separated using screens and were evaluated seeds of the same size in the germination test (GT), speed of germination index (SGI) and the accelerated aging test (AAT). Each plot consisted of 25 seeds and the design was completely randomized (one way classification) with four replications. The genetic and phenotypic parameters were estimated based on the mean square expectations of variance and covariance analyses. The populations of intra and interpopulational half-sibs differed in seed quality. The heterosis estimates were of low magnitude 4.5% in the GT, 10.1% in the AAT and 5.7% in the SGI. The largest proportion of the interpopulational additive genetic variance (?2 A12 or ?2 A12 or ?2 A21) was explained by the intrapopulational additive variance (?2 A11 ?2 A22)- This indicates the lesser importance of dominance and that reciprocal recurrent selection is less efficient than intrapopulational selection for these traits.",Genetic parameters; Heterosis; Reciprocal recurrent selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249149934

Although it is well established that different plant species vary considerably in the quality of pollinator rewards they offer, it is unclear how plant reproductive systems, in particular an obligate dependence on insects for pollination, might influence the evolution of pollinator rewards. Moreover, unlike the interaction between nectar reward and pollinator visitation, we have a limited understanding of the way in which pollen quality influences pollinator foraging behaviour. 2. We quantified the pollen protein and amino acid content for 23 NW European plant species. Pollen quality was compared with breeding system (facultative- vs. obligate insect-pollinated). A subset of 18 plants was sampled from a single habitat. For these we compared the proportion of pollen collection visits made by bumblebees with the quality of pollen offered. 3. We found a significant association between pollen quality and reproductive system; pollen of obligate insect-pollinated species contained higher protein content. We also found a significant relationship with pollinator use; plants most frequently visited by pollen-collecting bumblebees produced the highest-quality pollen. 4. We discuss how the close relationship between pollen quality and bumblebee attraction may have important benefits for plant reproductive success. However, we also show how the disruption of this mutualism can have detrimental consequences for plant and pollinator alike. © 2008 The Authors.",Bumblebee; Foraging behaviour; Plant reproduction; Pollination; Pollination syndrome; Pollinator reward,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47249086454

Thus, the indexes of self-incompatibility for the white- and yellow-flowered forms of C. bletioides, C. galeata, C. crispa, and C. chrysantha, were 1.00, 0.56, 0.82, 1.09, and 0.81, respectively; indicating that, excluding the yellow-flowered form of C. bletioides which must be regarded as partially self-incompatible, all orchids assessed are totally self-compatible plants.

However, the assumption of specialization in pollination systems and the reliability of floral traits in predicting the main pollinators have been questioned recently. In addition, the relationship between ecological and evolutionary specialization in pollination interactions is still poorly understood. We used data of 62 plant species from three communities across southern Norway to test: (1) the relationships between floral traits and the identity of pollinators, (2) the association between floral traits (evolutionary specialization) and ecological generalization, and (3) the consistency of both relationships across communities. Floral traits significantly affected the identity of pollinators in the three communities in a way consistent with the predictions derived from the pollination syndrome concept. However, hover flies and butterflies visited flowers with different shapes in different communities, which we mainly attribute to among-community variation in pollinator assemblages. Interestingly, ecological generalization depended more on the community-context (i.e. the plant and pollinator assemblages in the communities) than on specific floral traits. While open yellow and white flowers were the most generalist in two communities, they were the most specialist in the alpine community. Our results warn against the use of single measures of ecological generalization to question the pollination syndrome concept, and highlight the importance of community comparisons to assess the pollination syndromes, and to understand the relationships between ecological and evolutionary specialization in plant-pollinator interactions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Generalization; Plant community; Pollination syndromes; Pollinator community; Pollinator visitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48149110656

Manual cross-pollination using male-sterile plants to produce large quantities of hybrid seed is difficult and time-consuming because of the low success rate in cross-pollination. Insect pollinators may be suitable vectors to transfer pollen, but the most suitable vector for pollen transfer from the male parent to the female parent has not been identified for soybean. The objective of the present study was to evaluate seed-set on four male-sterile, female-fertile soybean lines by using alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata (F.)) and honey bees (Apis mellifera (L.)) as pollinators. Seed-set was evaluated in summers 2003 and 2005 near Ames, Iowa, USA and in summers 2003, 2004, and 2005 near Wooster, Ohio, USA. Neither the effect of pollinator species nor the interaction effect of pollinator species x location was significant for any year. Honey bees performed similarly to alfalfa leafcutting bees at both locations. The results indicated significant differences for seed-set among male-sterile lines, suggesting preferential pollination. Male-sterile lines, ms1 (Urbana) and ms2 (Ames 2), had higher cross-pollinated seed-set compared to ms6 (Ames 1), and ms6 (Corsoy 79). At the Ames location, ms1ms1 (Urbana) plants had the highest seed-set (50.16 seeds per male-sterile plant in 2005). At the Wooster location, ms1ms1 (Urbana) plants also had the highest seed-set (92.04 seeds per male-sterile plant) in 2005.

However, there is no certainty of the pollen tube growth through the style to reach the ovary. The pistil is a gatekeeper that evolved in many species to recognize and reject the self-pollen, avoiding endogamy and encouraging cross-pollination. However, recognition is a complex process, and specific factors are needed. Here the isolation and characterization of a stigma-specific protein from N. alata, NaStEP (N. alata Stigma Expressed Protein), that is homologous to Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitors, are reported. Activity gel assays showed that NaStEP is not a functional serine proteinase inhibitor. Immunohistochemical and protein blot analyses revealed that NaStEP is detectable in stigmas of self-incompatible (SI) species N. alata, N. forgetiana, and N. bonariensis, but not in self-compatible (SC) species N. tabacum, N. plumbaginifolia, N. benthamiana, N. longiflora, and N. glauca. NaStEP contains the vacuolar targeting sequence NPIVL, and immunocytochemistry experiments showed vacuolar localization in unpollinated stigmas. After self-pollination or pollination with pollen from the SC species N. tabacum or N. plumbaginifolia, NaStEP was also found in the stigmatic exudate. The synthesis and presence in the stigmatic exudate of this protein was strongly induced in N. alata following incompatible pollination with N. tabacum pollen. The transfer of NaStEP to the stigmatic exudate was accompanied by perforation of the stigmatic cell wall, which appeared to release the vacuolar contents to the apoplastic space. The increase in NaStEP synthesis after pollination and its presence in the stigmatic exudates suggest that this protein may play a role in the early pollen-stigma interactions that regulate pollen tube growth in Nicotiana. © 2008 The Author(s).",Kunitz proteinase inhibitor homologue; Nicotiana; Pollen-pistil interactions; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49449117741

In Ulex europaeus (Fabaceae), escaping seed predation resulted in extended, but variable flowering periods, with some plants flowering from autumn until spring and others flowering only in spring. The present study aims at understanding how gorses can have a high reproductive success during winter despite harsh climatic conditions and low number of pollinators. We measured pollen production, flower size and seed production in spring and winter, and compared the different seasons. The pollination success of flowers was high in both seasons. The flowers produced as much pollen, and were of comparable size in spring and winter, but they stayed open twice as long in winter than in spring. The high pollination rate we observed was thus due to the longer opening period of flowers and the high attractiveness of flowers during winter. However, pod abortion was higher in winter, with 43% of the flowers in winter and 75% in spring producing ripe pods. Antagonistic selective pressures exerted by biotic and abiotic interactions may, therefore, have lead to the observed flowering polymorphism, and allow U. europaeus to thrive in various climates, thus, increasing its invasiveness in different countries. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Flowering phenology; Invasive plant; Pollination; Seed predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849121421

Rodr. is a basal epidendroid orchid occurring in both the semi-deciduous and Atlantic rain forests of the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. This species presents a perfect flowering synchrony within populations, since all the mature buds of each plant open simultaneously in the morning hours of the same day. These flowers are available only for 1 day and are pollinated by several species of small solitary and social native bees. These bees exploit both pollen and nectar as a reward. The bees collecting pollen promote a higher fruit set and perform mainly self-pollination while those collecting nectar, which are less numerous, are responsible for an increase in cross-pollinations. P. modestus is self-compatible but pollinator dependent. Natural fruit set (open pollination) is low when compared with the numbers obtained under manual self- and cross-pollination. Low fruit set in natural conditions is related to deficient pollen transfer, and pollinator inefficiency seems to be the main factor. Some factors, such as the small amount of nectar produced, the low number of flowers per inflorescence and their availability for 1 day only added to the perfect flowering synchrony seem to be responsible for the increase of cross-pollinations. The offering of both pollen and nectar as a reward can represent a transitional condition in basal Epidendroideae. Based on floral morphology, reward production and pollinator behavior, the relationship of P. modestus with the basal and most derived groups within Orchidaceae is discussed.

To implement reasonable conservation, breeding and restorations program it is necessary to have the knowledge of pollen dispersal distance and fine-scale genetic structure. In this paper, levels and dispersion distance of pollen and spatial genetic structure of A. angustifolia were investigated in a 14 ha transect in a continuous forest in Paraná State, Brazil. Analyses have been performed by the use of eight microsatellite loci, paternity and TwoGener approaches, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. In transect, 52 male and 56 female adult trees were mapped and genotyped, together with 190 seeds. In the present transect, A. angustifolia show spatial genetic structure at distances up to 75 m. Paternity analysis indicated that 54% of seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the transect. The calculated average pollination distance within transect was 102 and 98 m based on the paternity analysis and TwoGener analysis, respectively. We found a significant pollen gene pool structure across seed-trees (?ft = 0.078, P &lt; 0.01) that corresponds to an effective number of pollen donors of 6.4 male trees or an effective pollination neighbourhood area (A ep ) of 2.1 ha. The findings suggest long-distance pollen dispersion (&gt;100 m) inside the continuous forest.

Box 438, St. John, WA 99171, United States","One of the major mechanisms of plant diversification has been the evolution of polyploid populations that differ from their diploid progenitors in morphology, physiology, and environmental tolerances. Recent studies have indicated that polyploidy may also have major effects on ecological interactions with herbivores and pollinators. We evaluated pollination of sympatric diploid and tetraploid plants of the rhizomatous herb Heucher a grossulariifolia (Saxifragaceae) along the Selway and Salmon Rivers of northern Idaho, USA, during four consecutive years. Previous molecular and ecological analyses had indicated that the tetraploid populations along these two river systems are independently derived and differ from each other in multiple traits. In each region, we evaluated floral visitation rate by all insect visitors, pollination efficacy of all major visitors, and relative contribution of all major pollinators to seed set. In both regions, diploid and tetraploid plants attracted different suites of floral visitors. Most pollination was attributable to several bee species and the moth Greya politella. Lasioglossum bees preferentially visited diploid plants at Lower Salmon but not at Upper Selway, queen Bombus centralis preferentially visited tetraploids at both sites, and worker B. centralis differed between sites in their cytotype preference. Hence, diploid and autotetraploid H. grossulariifolia plants act essentially as separate ecological species and may experience partial reproductive isolation through differential visitation and pollination by their major floral visitors. Overall the results, together with recent results from other studies, suggest that the repeated evolution of polyploidy in plants may contribute importantly to the structure and diversification of ecological interactions in terrestrial communities. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Bombus centralis; Divergent selection; Heuchera grossulariifolia; Idaho; Phenology; Pollination ecology; Polyploidy; Salmon and Selway Rivers; USA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54549123375

Although most orchid species have been shown to be severely pollination limited, few studies have investigated the impact of the above-mentioned factors on pollination success and reproduction, especially in rewarding species. In this study, the impact of population size, local density of flowering plants, and floral display on the rates of pollinia export and fruit production was investigated in 13 natural populations of the rewarding terrestrial orchid Listera ovata. In addition, an emasculation experiment was set up to examine how floral display and local density of flowering plants affected the relative importance of cross- vs. geitonogamous pollination in determining fruit set. In the studied populations, pollination efficiency, pollen removal, and fruit set increased with increasing population size until a threshold value of 30-40 flowering plants was reached, above which pollination efficiency and reproductive output decreased again. On average, plants with large floral displays showed higher proportional pollinia removal and fruit set compared with smaller plants. Fruit production was also significantly and positively related to local plant density, whereas emasculation did not affect the relationship between local plant density and fruit set, suggesting that geitonogamous pollination did not affect the outcome of female function. The results of this study are discussed in the light of the flowering mechanism of the species and its generalized pollination system. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Common twayblade; Female success; Fruit set; Geitonogamous vs. cross-pollination; Pollen dispersal; Pollen limitation; Pollinia removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849091279

M. tomentosa is very common in Caatinga areas and blooms year-round with two flowering peaks, one in the wet and another in the dry period. The pink, bright-colored flowers are distylous and both morphs are homogamous. The trichomatic nectary is located on the inner surface of the connate sepals, and the nectar (ca. 7 ?l) is accumulated in the space between the corolla and the calyx. Nectar sugar concentration reaches an average of 28%. The results of controlled pollination experiments show that M. tomentosa is self-incompatible. Pollen viability varies from 94% to 98%. In spite of being visited by several pollen vectors, flower attributes of M. tomentosa point to melittophily, and A. mellifera was the most frequent visitor and the principal pollinator. Although honeybees are exotic, severely competing with native pollinators, they are important together with other native bees, like Centris and Xylocopa species, for the fruit set of M. tomentosa.

We find that long-styled flowers serve primarily as pollen recipients and short-styled flowers as pollen donors, making this the first study to support the male-female interference hypothesis for the evolution of andromonoecy. However, this difference in the primary male or female function of the flowers depends on the pollinator identity. In flowers visited by Bombus impatiens, style length has a positive relationship with pollen deposition and a negative relationship with pollen removal. In contrast, neither morphological nor behavioral traits determine pollen deposition or removal by small halictid bees.

If the addition of cross-pollen to stigmas increases fruit/seed production, it is interpreted as an evidence of pollen limitation. Much of the limitation may be associated with the quality rather than quantity of pollen; however, most studies do not discriminate between the two, which may lead to misinterpretation of the results. We studied the effects of quality and quantity of pollen on the reproduction of a northern Spanish population of Crataegus monogyna. The treatments included self- and cross-pollination, and supplementation to open and bagged flowers. The response variables considered were number of pollen grains per stigma, pollen tubes per style, and initial and final fruit set. In the Cantabrian range, C. monogyna requires insect pollinators to set fruit and is partially self-incompatible. We found that the number of pollen tubes did not differ between cross- and self-pollination treatments; however, self-pollinated flowers set less fruits than flowers that received pure cross-pollen or were supplemented with both cross- and self-pollen. The experimental design allowed us to infer qualitative rather than quantitative pollen limitation. Comparison of the number of pollen grains and tubes, and initial and final fruit set among pollination treatments suggested post-zygotic embryo selection against selfed progeny. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The first well-established case involves a homing group I intron in the mitochondrial cox1 gene shown to have been frequently acquired via horizontal transfer in angiosperms. Here, we report extensive additional sampling of angiosperms, including 85 newly sequenced introns from 30 families. Analysis of all available data leads us to conclude that, among the 640 angiosperms (from 212 families) whose cox1 intron status has been characterized thus far, the intron has been acquired via roughly 70 separate horizontal transfer events. We propose that the intron was originally seeded into angiosperms by a single transfer from fungi, with all subsequent inferred transfers occurring from one angiosperm to another. The pattern of angiosperm-to-angiosperm transfer is biased toward exchanges between plants belonging to the same family. Illegitimate pollination is proposed as one potential factor responsible for this pattern, given that aberrant, cross-species pollination is more likely between close relatives. Other potential factors include shared vectoring agents or common geographic locations. We report the first apparent cases of loss of the cox1 intron; losses are accompanied by retention of the exonic coconversion tract, which is located immediately downstream of the intron and which is a product of the intron's self-insertion mechanism. We discuss the many reasons why the cox1 intron is so frequently and detectably transferred, and rarely lost, and conclude that it should be regarded as the ""canary in the coal mine"" with respect to horizontal transfer in angiosperm mitochondria. © The Author 2008.

We tested this hypothesis in the prairie plant Eryngium yuccifolium and its floral herbivore Coleotechnites eryngiella. At five Illinois tallgrass prairie sites, we collected central, primary lateral, and secondary lateral inflorescences from E. yuccifolium to determine whether damage by the larvae of C. eryngiella to the flowers in earlier developing inflorescences would be compensated for in later developing inflorescences. Coleotechnites eryngiella does extensive damage to the central and primary inflorescences and little damage to the secondary inflorescences. Later maturing inflorescences did not compensate for early damage by increasing seed production in later inflorescences. The secondary inflorescences of E. yuccifolium may only compensate for catastrophic damage done to the central and primary inflorescences early on in development, serve as additional advertisements for pollinators, act as pollen donors, or allow the plant to take advantage of ""ecological windows"" of high pollinator and low herbivore abundance. Our findings were spatially and temporally consistent and did not support the predictions of the reserve ovary model in the E. yuccifolium-C. eryngiella system suggesting that in this system, alternate, proximate, and ultimate causes need to be explored for the production of surplus flowers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Compensation; Path analysis; Plant-herbivore interactions; Reproductive ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849090394

Flowers in all three species (Digitalis purpurea, Digitalis grandiflora and Digitalis lanata) are aggregated in racemes. Corollas are characteristically bell shaped enclosing four, didynamously arranged stamens. The stigma is deeply bifid only in D. purpurea. The three species over-winter as underground tubers and sprouting during the following spring occurs first in D. lanata, followed by D. purpurea and D. grandiflora. Floral bud opening in an inflorescence in all three species occurs sequentially from the bottom upwards in an acropetal succession and male and female phases are temporally separated with basal flowers entering the male phase first followed by the upper flowers in a regular sequence. Only after shedding the pollen grains completely do the flowers shift to the female phase. Resource allocation in all three species is more towards maleness than femaleness during anthesis. The species are principally insect pollinated and selfing is denied because of protandry and spatial separation of the stigma and anthers. Copious amounts of viable pollen grains produced by these species aid in successful pollination, fertilization and seed production. Studies revealed that none of these species operates autogamy because hand-pollinated flowers with self-pollen or bagged flowers (foreign pollen excluded) failed to set seed. High seed output in open-pollinated flowers and high pollen-ovule ratios also indicate the outbreeding nature of these species. Thus, any reduction in the number of individuals constituting a population would significantly reduce the floral display and consequent rewards to the pollinators, with a subsequent influence on seed roduction. Hence, data on the reproductive biology of overexploited species, such as Digitalis spp., is of pivotal importance in formulating effective conservation strategies.© 2008 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.",Breeding system; Digitalis; Phenology; Pollen-ovule ratio; Pollination mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350169245

Although a number of studies have assessed how plant and floral traits influence pollen movement via changes in pollinator behavior, few have explored how nectar chemical composition affects pollen transfer. As many as 55% of plants produce secondary compounds in their nectar, which is surprising given that nectar is typically thought to attract pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that nectar with secondary compounds may benefit plants by encouraging pollinators to leave plants after visiting only a few flowers, thus reducing self-pollen transfer. We used Gelsemium sempervirens, a plant whose nectar contains the alkaloid gelsemine, which has been shown to be a deterrent to foraging bee pollinators. We found that high nectar alkaloids reduced the total and proportion of self-pollen received by one-half and one-third, respectively. However, nectar alkaloids did not affect female reproduction when we removed the potential for self-pollination (by emasculating all flowers on plants). We then tested the assumption that self-pollen in combination with outcrossed pollen depresses seed set. We found that plants were weakly self-compatible, but self-pollen with outcrossed pollen did not reduce seed set relative to solely outcrossed flowers. Finally, an exponential model of pollen carryover suggests that high nectar alkaloids could benefit plants via increased pollen export (an estimate of male function), but only when pollinators were efficient and abundant and plants had large floral displays. Results suggest that high nectar alkaloids may benefit plants via increased pollen export under a restricted set of ecological conditions, but in general, the costs of high nectar alkaloids in reducing pollination balanced or outweighed the benefits of reducing self-pollen transfer for estimates of female and male reproduction. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Distyly; Geitonogamy; Gelsemium sempervirens; Nectar alkaloids; Nectar quality; Nectar secondary compounds; Outcrossed vs. selfed; Pollination; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54549097991

Nevertheless, background information allowing evaluation of impacts is rather scarce for some geographic zones. Our study of an alpine community on the Plateau of Muses (2600-2750 m a.s.l.) of Mt Olympos, the highest mountain of Greece, conducted in 1993-1994, can provide such background information for the Mediterranean region. We studied features relating to phenology of flowering, floral morphology, distribution and abundance, and flower visitors of plant species that exhibit a biotic pollination syndrome. We identified dominant patterns and we further (i) explored the relative contribution of the plant features and abiotic factors studied in explaining the activity patterns of flower visitors, (ii) examined if flower and visitor traits of the alpine community match each other according to the classical pollination syndromes, and (iii) investigated whether the responses of individual plant species to the yearly climatic variability result into phenological patterns that characterize the whole community. The common strategy of the alpine community was for early flowering and long flower life span; consistently early flowering species were twice as many as late flowering ones, whereas floral longevity (estimated for 36 species) averaged 5.2 days. Duration of flowering (estimated for 57 species) averaged 18.2 days. Climatic variability affected onset of flowering; all late flowering species delayed their flowering during the year characterized by a humid and cold summer. Duration of flowering and floral longevity did not change in a consistent way. Hymenoptera (Aculeates) were the dominant flower visitors. They accounted for 43.3% of the visits recorded, with bumblebees making a little less than half. Diptera followed making 37.5% of the visits (most made by syrphid flies). There was a mismatch between flower-morphology and flower visitor traits; the alpine community had predominantly non-specialized, pale-colour flowers, which are traits assumed to correspond to Diptera dominance and absence of social bees. Visitation was influenced by flower abundance and duration of flowering; proportionately more Diptera, and proportionately less Hymenoptera visited species with short flowering periods and few flowers present in the field.

Hawkmoths (Sphingidae) are important plant associates at two lifehistory stages: larvae are herbivorous, whereas adults are nectar feeders and often pollinators. The diversity and identities of plants used for nectar is poorly known, however. 2. This study takes a community-level approach to hawkmoth nectar plant usage in a semi-arid grassland habitat in southern Arizona, U.S.A. 3. Pollen carried on the proboscis was identified from over 700 individuals of 14 hawkmoth species attracted to lights over a 2-year period. 4. Two plant species dominated pollen loads, suggesting that hawkmoths use these species extensively as nectar sources: Datura wrightii (Solanaceae), a classic hawkmothpollinated plant, and Agave palmeri (Agavaceae), which is known to be used extensively by bats. Field surveys indicate that both species are relatively rare in the flowering community. Little or no pollen was present on the moths from the most common plant species in flower during the study. 5. The dominance of Agave in pollen loads suggests that this typically bat-pollinated species may be subsidising pollinator populations of the hawkmoth-pollinated flora. 6. Three groups of hawkmoths within this community are identified based on larval diets (reported in the literature) and adult diets (documented here): those that, at a given site, heavily exploit the same plant species at both life-history stages (Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata); those that have broad local associations at both life-history stages (Hyles lineata); and those that exhibit narrow but non-overlapping local associations at the two life-history stages (all other hawkmoths at this site). © 2008 The Royal Entomological Society.",Arizona; Hawkmoth community; Host plant; Hyles Manduca; Nectar; Pollination; Sphingidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64549122901

We studied the floral biology, pollinators and reproductive systems of two tree species in Itatiaia, an area covered with montane rain forest. Pseudopiptadenia contorta is widespread in Brazil but is present at a low relative density at the study site, while Pseudopiptadenia leptostachya is restrictively distributed but presents one of its highest relative density values in Itatiaia. Both species have small flowers arranged in compact spicate raceme inflorescences that constitute the pollination unit. Pollinators are native stingless bees and European honeybees that collect pollen from their nectarless flowers. Although both species have similar floral characteristics and pollination system, their compatibility system differs. Fruit set after manual pollinations and observation of the pollen tube growth showed that P. leptostachya is self-compatible while P. contorta only set fruits after cross-pollinations, and is thus a self-incompatible species. However, fruit set did not differ between the species, indicating that structural parameters are not affected by the compatibility system. Thus, the difference between these two species in terms of reproductive system may be related to other factors such as patterns of geographical distribution. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Considering the diverse modes of pollen tube growth observed in other Fagales, we investigated the growth of pollen tubes in the pistil of Ticodendron. At the time of pollination, T. incognitum had four immature ovules in a bilocular ovary, thus exhibiting delayed fertilization, as in other Fagales. During the period when fertilization was delayed, pollen tube growth in the pistil was intermittent, consisting of five steps associated with development of the ovules and embryo sacs. Four cessation sites occurred: in the style, in the tissue of the upper part of the ovary, inside and outside of the funicle and at the chalaza. A single pollen tube eventually reaches a mature embryo sac through the chalaza in one of the four ovules. While both delayed fertilization and intermittent pollen tube growth play a role in male and female gametophyte selection, as in other Fagales, the five-step process of pollen tube growth through the chalaza (i.e. chalazogamy) is characteristic of lineages of the Casuarinaceae, Ticodendraceae and Betulaceae (the latter with the loss of one step). © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Betulaceae; Casuarinaceae; Delayed fertilization; Fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849134172

Analyses of the combined datasets with parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed that Aerides is monophyletic and consists of three well-supported subclades which are only partly in accordance with previous sectional delimitations based on floral characters. The two different flower types in Aerides (hidden versus open spur entrance) seem to have evolved at least twice in geographically distinct areas. The phylogeny presented here is yet another example in Orchidaceae where floral morphology cannot be relied on to reconstruct phylogenetic history but rather is the result of pollinator-driven selection. The Aerides subclades are characterized by three different length classes of the mutation-rich P8 region in the trnL intron. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the P8 region was studied in orchids. The matK gene has been assumed to be a pseudogene in orchids due to occasional occurrence of frameshift indels, low transition/transversion (ts:tv) ratios and low substitution rates at the 3rd codon position. However, matK does not appear to be a pseudogene in Aerides and a comparison with data from other angiosperms suggests that ts:tv ratios and low substitution rates have been overestimated as arguments for a pseudogene status of matK in orchids. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Bees are also crucial in maintaining biodiversity by pollinating numerous plant species whose fertilisation requires an obligatory pollinator. Apis mellifera is a species that has shown great adaptive potential, as it is found almost everywhere in the world and in highly diverse climates. In a context of climate change, the variability of the honey bee's life-history traits as regards temperature and the environment shows that the species possesses such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise to the selection of development cycles suited to new environmental conditions. Although we do not know the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change, there is a large body of data at our disposal indicating that environmental changes have a direct influence on honey bee development. In this article, the authors examine the potential impact of climate change on honey bee behaviour, physiology and distribution, as well as on the evolution of the honey bee's interaction with diseases.

Open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) and hybrids are the products targeted for this region. Among the hybrids, three-way and double-cross hybrids are desired. Thus the use of single crosses as testers would be an appropriate choice for such a breeding program as one could potentially identify three-way combinations during the early generation test. A twelve-parent diallel was formed and crosses evaluated to identify heterotic groups and single-cross testers. Crosses were evaluated under four different environments in Zimbabwe, two optimal, one low nitrogen stress and one drought stress. P5 (an early maturing line from heterotic group A) and CML 395 (a late maturing inbred line from heterotic group B) were used as reference parents to establish heterotic groupings of germplasm used in the diallel.

So, the objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic variability and identify heterotic groups among Brazilian popcorn varieties. Thus, diallel crosses of advanced generations of the popcorn hybrids, IAC 112 and Zélia, and of three open-pollinated popcorn varieties, RS 20, Branco, and SAM were performed. Ten hybrid combinations, the five parents, and five check treatments were arranged in a block design with four replicates in two tropical-zone locations (CWb climate). Both additive and non-additive effects were important for grain yield, plant height, ear height, and husk cover. For popping expansion, only the additive effects were important. Hybrid combinations between the local variety (Branco) and F2 populations (IAC 112 and Zelia) resulted in the third and fourth highest values for popping expansion. The best grain yields were obtained with hybrid combinations involving SAM. Cultivars Zélia, IAC 112, and RS 20 increased popping expansion, whereas cultivar Branco increased grain yield of hybrid combinations. The following conclusions may be drawn: Brazilian popcorn populations have reduced heterosis and genetic variability to popping expansion in relation commercial cultivars; there is genetic variability among Brazilian popcorn populations that allows the exploitation of additive and non-additive effects for grain yield; it is possible to increase grain yield by using local varieties; but it would be difficult to obtain commercial hybrids from local varieties because they have poor performance for popping expansion. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Breeding; Heterosis; Local variety; Maize; Popping expansion; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46249097415

Location: Nakoudojima Island, Bonin Archipelago (Ogasa- wara Shoto), Japan. Methods: Soil samples were collected at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths from seven plots in forests, grasslands, artificially matted areas and bare land. Soil seed banks were assessed using the seedling emergence method followed by the hand-sorting of ungerminated seeds. We determined the size and composition of the seed banks in upper soil layers of plots and compared the seed banks to the standing vegetation. Results: A total of 12 220 seedlings belonging to 42 species from 20 families germinated. Total mean seed density (0-5 cm depth) was low in all plots within forest, grassland, and heavily degraded vegetation types (34.7 ± 8.6 to 693.5 ± 123.6, 58.6 ± 7.8 to 107.1 ± 10.0, and 1.1 ± 0.5 to 7.2 ± 2.3 seeds/m2, respectively). Forbs and graminoids dominated the seed banks of grassland and forest plots including Cyperus brevifolius, Gnaphalium pensylvanicum, Oxalis corniculata and Solarium nigrum, and these alien species comprised 90% of the density of the seed bank. There was little correlation between seed banks and standing vegetation of the island (Sørensen similarity coefficient values 0.26 to 0.45). Conclusions: If natural regeneration occurs from the seed bank of the island, future vegetations will not move toward the original forest community, because the seed bank is dominated by non-native herbaceous grassland species. Though isolated, a few forest remnants with low species richness could be an important source for the natural re-establishment of forest on the island; however, seed availability may be limited by either poor dispersal or pollination so that woody species will probably recover very slowly on this goat-impacted island.",Invasive species; Overgrazing; Restoration; Seed bank composition; Species-poor grassland; Subtropical; Subtropical moist low forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59649104679

A high accumulation of biomass, followed by its efficient partitioning, was crucial in determining grain productivity under arid zone. There was also no trade-off between stover and grain productivity and several landraces outperformed check cultivars in both grain and stover yields. The manifestation of heterosis in the landrace-based topcross hybrids varied for different traits. Significant heterosis for biomass, grain yield and stover yield was observed in specific male-sterile seed parent x landrace-based pollinator combinations. Utilization of landraces in variety development and topcross hybrids breeding programmes targeting north-western India or similar regions are discussed. © NIAB 2008.",Adaptation; Arid zone; Improved cultivars; Landraces; Pearl millet; Stover productivity; Topcross hybrids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149385213

The two populations have similar pollen:ovule ratios, index of self incompatibility, stigma receptivity duration, pollen longevity, flower longevity, floral morphology and seed production rate. These data indicate no apparent selective pressure on floral characteristics or on the breeding system, which may be exerted by the pollinators. The two populations retained their autonomous blooming rhythm even after transplantation, which indicated that this character was genetically determined. There are no genetic barriers and the populations may share some pollinators (Schwartz-Tzachor et al. 2006). Thus the main potential restriction on gene flow is the incomplete phenological barrier. These findings may indirectly support our hypothesis that the phenological shift is due to environmental cues. Thus it was concluded that these two types are 'phenological ecotypes' in the sense of Turesson (1922) due to the unequivocal delineation of both types, as revealed by the timing of leaf appearance (synanthous versus hysteranthous) without any evidence of any intermediates. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Cyclamen; Ecotypic differentiation; Hysteranthous; Phenology; Synanthous,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349116127

Seven individual hybrids, most likely F1 plants representing a single interspecific pollination event, first flowered with both parents in May 2006 at a nature reserve in the Chiltern Hills near Goring, Oxfordshire. Univariate and multivariate morphometric analyses (43 characters plus 12 indices), internal transcribed spacer sequencing, plastid microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses together readily separate the parents and confirm that O. purpurea was the ovule parent and O. simia the pollen parent, presumably reflecting the greater frequency and/or later flowering period of the latter at the site. This study reinforces a more general observation that, in most orchids, the ovule parent contributes substantially more to the hybrid phenotype than does the pollen parent, perhaps reflecting cytoplasmic inheritance. In contrast, the hybrids are placed closer to O. simia than to O. purpurea in the AFLP tree. Apparently recent arrivals, the few O. purpurea plants at Goring contrast genetically with the two other small populations of this species known in the Chilterns, but rather are consistent with relatively uncommon Continental populations. This suggests that the plants may have been deliberately introduced at Goring by man, although transport from the Continent in high-level air currents cannot be ruled out. The Goring population of O. simia is likely to have become genetically impoverished through (1) preferential removal of many relatively fit plants to herbaria in the 19th century and/or (2) a catastrophic population crash in the first half of the 20th century. However, both our re-examination of herbarium specimens and our population genetic data indicate past hybridization among anthropomorphic Orchis species occurring naturally in the Chilterns. Thus, we tentatively recommend retention of the hybrid plants at Goring, despite their likely anthropogenic origin from Continental material and the partial viability of their pollen and seeds, which offers opportunities for future introgression. Although the Goring hybrids broadly resemble morphologically O. militaris, another anthropomorphic Orchis still found at two Chiltern localities, sufficient morphological and molecular differences were observed to strongly refute our initial hypothesis that O. militaris could have originated through hybridization between ancestors that resembled O. purpurea and O. simia.

It is well established that pollen-mediated gene flow among natural plant populations depends on a complex interaction between the spatial distribution of pollen sources and the short- and long-distance components of pollen dispersal. Despite this knowledge, spatial isolation strategies proposed in Europe to ensure the harvest purity of conventional crops are based on distance from the nearest genetically modified (GM) crop and on empirical data from two-plot experiments. Here, we investigate the circumstances under which the multiplicity of pollen sources over the landscape should be considered in strategies to contain GM crops. 2. We simulated pollen dispersal over eighty 6 × 6 km simulated landscapes differing in field characteristics and in amount of GM and conventional maize. Pollen dispersal was modelled either via a Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG, currently used for European coexistence studies) or a bivariate Student (2Dt) kernel. These kernels differ in their amount of short- and long-distance dispersal. We used linear models to analyse the impact of local and landscape variables on impurity rates (i.e. proportion of seeds sired by pollen from a transgenic crop) in conventional fields and quantified their increase due to dispersal from other than the closest GM crops. 3. The average impurity rate over a landscape increased linearly with the proportion of GM maize over that landscape. The increase was twice as fast using the NIG kernel and was governed by the short-distance dispersal component. 4. Variation in impurity rates largely depended on the distance to the closest GM crop and the size of the receptor field. However, impurity rates were generally underestimated when only dispersal from the closest GM field was considered. 5. Synthesis and applications. Distance to the closest GM crop had most impact on impurity rates in conventional fields. However, impurity rates also depended on intermediate- to long-distance dispersal from distant GM crops. Therefore, isolation distances as currently defined will probably not allow long-term coexistence of GM and conventional crops, especially as the proportion of GM crops grown increases. We suggest strategies to account for this impact of long-distance dispersal. © 2008 The Authors.",Coexistence; Corn; Cross-pollination; Landscape; Model; Pollen dispersal; Spatial distribution; Transgenic; Upscaling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749142167

For this purpose, a 1038 bp cDNA fragment of muskmelon soluble acid invertase was expressed in antisense orientation behind the 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus. The phenotype of the antisense plants clearly differed from that of control plants. The transgenic plant leaves were markedly smaller, and the stems were obviously thinner. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that degradation of the chloroplast membrane occurred in transgenic leaves and the number of grana in the chloroplast was significantly reduced, suggesting that the slow growth and weaker phenotype of the transgenic plants may be due to damage to the chloroplast ultrastructure, which in turn resulted in a decrease in net photosynthetic rate. The sucrose concentration increased and levels of acid invertase decreased in transgenic fruit, and the fruit size was 60% smaller than that of the control. In addition, transgenic fruit reached full-slip at 25 d after pollination (DAP), approximately 5 d before the control fruit (full-slip at 30 DAP), and this accelerated maturity correlated with a dramatic elevation of ethylene production at the later stages of fruit development. Together, these results suggest that soluble acid invertase not only plays an important role during muskmelon plant and fruit development but also controls the sucrose content in muskmelon fruit. © The Author [2008].

A yellow bacterium was consistently isolated from the affected fruits. To confirm the pathogenicity of eight representative isolates of the yellow bacterium, we stub-inoculated ovaries (immature-fruits) 5-7 days after artificial pollination, with a pin smeared with bacteria. After the melon fruits had grown for 60 more days, an internal fruit rot resembling the natural infection appeared, and the inoculated bacterium was reisolated. The melon isolates had properties identical with Pantoea ananatis, such as gram-negative staining, facultative anaerobic growth, indole production, phenylalanine deaminase absence, and acid production from melibiose, sorbitol, glycerol, and inositol. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that the melon bacterium positioned closely with known P. ananatis strains.

Transitions from actinomorphy to zygomorphy have occurred repeatedly among flowering plants, possibly in coadaptation with specialized pollinators. In this paper, the rules controlling the evolution of floral symmetry were investigated to determine in which architectural context zygomorphy can evolve. • Methods: Floral traits potentially associated with perianth symmetry shifts in Asteridae, one of the major clades of the core eudicots, were selected: namely the perianth merism, the presence and number of spurs, and the androecium organ number. The evolution of these characters was optimized on a composite tree. Correlations between symmetry and the other morphological traits were then examined using a phylogenetic comparative method. • Key Results: The analyses reveal that the evolution of floral symmetry in Asteridae is conditioned by both androecium organ number and perianth merism and that zygomorphy is a prerequisite to the emergence of spurs. • Conclusions: The statistically significant correlation between perianth zygomorphy and oligandry suggests that the evolution of floral symmetry could be canalized by developmental or spatial constraint. Interestingly, the evolution of polyandry in an actinomorphic context appears as an alternative evolutionary pathway to zygomorphy in Asteridae. These results may be interpreted either in terms of plant-pollinator adaptation or in terms of developmental or physical constraints. The results are discussed in relation to current knowledge about the molecular bases underlying floral symmetry. © The Author 2008.

Our evaluation of morphological characters and the extent of RAPD differentiation found sets the stage for a taxonomic restructuring to hoist both var. arbuscula and var. schizogynophylla to subspecies category. Our genetic results suggest that fragmentation and generally low population sizes are jeopardising the survival of this species through a predominance of stochastic processes in microevolutionary dynamics, especially in Gran Canaria, where subpopulations exhibit the lowest levels of genetic variation and gene flow. If, as most Asteraceae, these plants have a sporophytic self-incompatibility system, the scarce reproductive turnover observed in the much smaller subpopulations from Gran Canaria (ssp. schizogynophylla) is possibly more influenced by a deficiency of S-alleles (that would be provoking the unavailability of compatible mating types, and a cascade of deleterious effects associated with the Allee effect) than by a reduced pollinator visitation frequency. Based on the depauperated values of genetic parameters for this subspecies, urgent mixed subpopulation reinforcements and reintroductions (with specimens belonging to the same subspecies) seem advisable on the grounds that they might allow the isolated habitat remnants to retrieve from inbreeding through the introduction of a new stock of S-alleles and the subsequent production of genotypes that may have a higher selective value. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Atractylis arbuscula; Canary Islands; Conservation genetics; Morphology; RAPDs; Taxonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349093005

We achieved 28 captures in the wet season and 30 in the dry season, which represents the largest data set in existence for this rare species. We took morphological data and collected pollen from the bats' pelage. Diet analysis revealed the genera Cleome, Pseudobombax, Crataeva, Agave, Helicteres, and the columnar cactus Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum as main food plants. We found no indication for a tight relationship between M. harrisoni and long-tubed flowers that would obligatorily require a long rostrum for exploitation, with the possible exception of the columnar cactus. However, because cacti are common food plants for many less-specialized nectar-feeding bats, the extraordinarily long rostrum might permit M. harrisoni to use the same abundant plant species as larger species while maintaining a smaller body size, therefore having lower absolute energy requirements. This in turn could facilitate a resident lifestyle in a habitat with annual resource bottlenecks. Males have significantly longer snouts (approximately 9%) than females, suggesting that rostrum length also might be influenced by intraspecific interactions or restrictions. Our favored explanation is that the rostrum length of females may be limited by stability issues, because calcium mobilization during pregnancy and lactation can considerably weaken bone structure. © 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.",Cactaceae; Colima; Conservation; Dry forest; Endangered bats; Evolution; Pollination; Sexual dimorphism; Tongue length,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51349110569

A limited number of named Clianthus cultivars of indeterminate origin are commonly grown as ornamentals. Genomic DNA from individual Clianthus plants was extracted for genetic diversity analysis using a range of molecular markers, including amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Data were analysed by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA), the generation of Neighbor-Joining trees, and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA). Genetic distance between wild populations of C. maximus was highly correlated with geographical distance between populations. Sequencing of intron 2 of a putative partial homologue of the floral meristem identity gene LEAFY (CmLFY) revealed a 7 bp deletion that was exhibited homozygously in the more northern populations of C. maximus, and in all individuals tested from the sole population of C. puniceus. This deletion was not exhibited in more southern populations of C. maximus. Further, one geographically intermediate population contained some plants that were heterozygous for the deletion. Parallel analyses of cultivated Clianthus genotypes, more than half of which were also homozygous for the 7 bp deletion, showed that these were not representative of the broad, but threatened, diversity remaining in the wild. It is argued that wild populations of C. maximus are unlikely to have arisen from the escape of plants from cultivation. Conservation effort should focus on the protection and study of the extant plants in these wild populations, rather than on the introduction of disturbance regimes to uncover potential seed banks. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There have been 10 races described since 1824, six of which have been identified in the past 10 years. Race identification is based on qualitative disease reactions on a set of diverse host differentials which include openpollinated cultivars, contemporary hybrid cultivars, and older hybrid cultivars that are no longer produced. The development of a set of nearisogenic open-pollinated spinach lines (NILs), having different resistance loci in a susceptible and otherwise common genetic background, would facilitate identification of races of the downy mildew pathogen, provide a tool to better understand the genetics of resistance, and expedite the development of molecular markers linked to these disease resistance loci. To achieve this objective, the spinach cv. Viroflay, susceptible to race 6 of Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae, was used as the recurrent susceptible parent in crosses with the hybrid spinach cv. Lion, resistant to race 6. Resistant F 1 progeny were subsequently backcrossed to Viroflay four times with selection for race 6 resistance each time. Analysis of the segregation data showed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene, and the resistance locus was designated Pfs-1. By bulk segregant analysis, an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker (E-ACT/M-CTG) linked to Pfs-1 was identified and used to develop a co-dominant Sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker. This SCAR marker, designated Dm-1, was closely linked (?1.7 cM) to the Pfs-1 locus and could discriminate among spinach genotypes that were homozygous resistant (Pfs-1Pfs-1), heterozygous resistant (Pfs-1pfs-1), or homozygous susceptible (pfs-1pfs-1) to race 6 within the original mapping population. Evaluation of a wide range of commercial spinach lines outside of the mapping population indicated that Dm-1 could effectively identify Pfs-1 resistant genotypes; the Dm-1 marker correctly predicted the disease resistance phenotype in 120 out of 123 lines tested. In addition, the NIL containing the Pfs-1 locus (Pfs-1Pfs-1) was resistant to multiple races of the downy mildew pathogen indicating Pfs-1 locus may contain a cluster of resistance genes. © 2008 The American Phytopathological Society.",Blue mold; Leafy vegetables; Marker-assisted selection; Peronospora effusa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49449102346

Research in other crops, however, has verified significant intra-cultivar variation based either on phenotypic differentiation or molecular analysis techniques. The present study primarily investigated possible intra-cultivar variation for seedcotton yield. Honeycomb selection within three elite cotton cultivars, on the basis of single-plant seedcotton yield and under the ultra-low density of 1.2 plants/m2, was performed. From each cultivar, six selfed (hand-pollinated) plants were selected and seed of each selected plant constituted a separate line. The 18 first generation lines were evaluated in three locations at a density of 1.2 plants/m2. Within each line, the 10 selfed plants which yielded the highest were selected. Mixed seed from these selected plants constituted the respective second generation line. Offspring performance of the 18 second generation lines was also tested in three locations at a density of 1.2 plants/m2. The results were indicative of intra-cultivar variation, since significant differentiation between lines of each cultivar was found for seedcotton yield per plant, averaged across two years and three locations. Additionally, significant intra-cultivar variation was found for fibre quality properties (length and micronaire, but not strength and uniformity) averaged across two years in a single location, as well as for physiological traits (leaf carbon isotope discrimination, ash content and K concentration) averaged across two years and three locations. In comparison with the original cultivars the second generation lines had higher seedcotton yields supporting the existence of exploitable genetic variation. The conclusion was that honeycomb selection in the absence of competition could be an effective technique in breeders' seed treatment in order to avoid gradual degeneration and beneficially exploit any latent or newly developed genetic variation. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749151902

We have obtained a CMS-Rf system consisting of sterile line '9802A1', maintainer line '9802B1' and restorer line '9802H'. F1 plants from cross between sterile line '9802A1' and restorer line '9802H' were all male fertile, self pollination of F1 plants produced an F2 segregating population consisting of 600 individuals. The segregating population was found to fit a segregation ratio 3:1 for male fertile and sterile types, indicating that male fertility is restored by a single dominant gene (termed Rfo2) in the CMS-Rf system. Based on the DNA sequence of Rfo/Rfk1 (AJ535623), just one full length gene in the sterile line '9802A1', in the restorer line '9802H' and in the male fertile line '2006H', was cloned, respectively. The three sequences correspond to the same gene with two alleles: Rfob in '9802H' and rfob in '9802A1' and '2006H'. These two alleles differ from Rfo/Rfk1 and rfk1 (AJ535624) alleles by two synonymous base substitutions, respectively. Based on the differences between the Rfob and rfob genes, one PCR-based marker was developed, and designated Marker 1, which is identical to the corresponding region of Rfob by sequence analysis. In the F2 segregating population described above, the Marker 1 was present in 5 sterile plants and in 453 fertile plants, absent in 4 fertile plants and in 138 sterile plants, and was found to fit a segregation ratio 3:1 indicating that Rfob was single copy in '9802H'. Linkage analysis showed that the Rfo2 locus for our CMS-Rf system was distant from the Rfo locus by about 1.6 cM. The sterile line '9802A1' was pollinated by the male fertile line '2006H' and the resulting F1 plants were all male fertile. These results indicated that the male fertility of radish CMS can be restored by a new Rf locus, which linked tightly to the Rfo locus. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47249151813

Understanding avian diet preferences reveals a great deal about the birds' digestive physiology and relationships with food plants, and can make a valuable contribution towards directing physiological and ecological research. Importantly, diet preferences are likely to reflect physiological constraints and therefore mechanisms of digestion. 2. We assessed the interaction between diet concentration and sugar-type preferences of three Australian nectarivorous bird species. Each individual bird was offered paired energetically-equivalent diets: a sucrose solution and hexose (1:1 mixture of glucose:fructose) solution over a range of diet concentrations from 0.075 to 2 mol L-1 Sucrose Equivalents (SE). 3. Similar patterns were found for all three species. Intake on the most dilute diets was insufficient to maintain energy balance, suggesting that these birds faced physiological constraints on such diets. 4. All three species demonstrated a preference for hexose over sucrose when offered dilute diets, and sucrose (or none) preference on more concentrated diets. The three species differed in terms of when this switch from hexose to sucrose preference took place. Rainbow lorikeets (Psittacidae, c. 135 g body mass) demonstrated hexose preference for diets up to and including 0.75 mol L-1 SE; sucrose was preferred on 2 mol L-1 SE diets. Red wattlebirds (Meliphagidae, c. 105 g) showed hexose preference on only the most dilute (0.075 mol L-1 SE) diet, and sucrose preference on 1 and 2 mol L -1 SE diets. New Holland honeyeaters (Meliphagidae, c. 22 g) preferred hexose on 0.075 and 0.1 mol L-1 SE diets, and their selectivity for sucrose was not statistically significant. We suggest that the switch from hexose preference may be directly related to the digestive capacity of different taxa. 5. Accumulating evidence suggests similar patterns of sugar preferences in various nectarivorous bird lineages. A switch from hexose preference on dilute diets to sucrose preference on concentrated diets has now been shown for hummingbirds, flowerpiercers, sunbirds, honeyeaters and lorikeets. Hexose preference on dilute diets suggests that reduced digesta retention time and low sugar concentration influences sucrose hydrolysis efficiency, whilst absorption rate of monosaccharides is less limiting. Sucrose preference on concentrated diets is more puzzling, but may reflect preference for diets with lower osmolality. Varying preferences suggest that the co-evolutionary relationships between birds and nectar sugar composition are likely to be similarly dynamic and situation dependent. © 2008 The Authors.",Digestive constraint; Honeyeater; Lorikeet; Nectar sugars; Plant-pollinator co-evolution; Sucrose hydrolysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47249098997

Following the principle of a case-by-case for transgenic crop safety assessment, we designed experiments to study pollen-mediated gene flow from herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape to Chinese commercial varieties. The pollen dispersal was detected as the progeny of recipient plants that were identified as glufosinate resistant. The results indicated that pollen dispersal occurred up to 2000 m and its rate sharply decreased as the distance from the pollen source increased. However, the rate of long-distance pollen dispersal from 33 to 2000 m was less than 0.015% and did not present a gradual decrease, indicating the randomization of dispersal and pollination. Most pollen dispersed within a 4.5 m area around the transgenic pollen source plot, with a maximum of 1.19% at the sampling site of 1.4 m. Wind direction significantly affected the direction and the distance of pollen dispersal, resulting in the more and farther dispersal in southwest direction. However, the number of potentially pollinating bees was not correlated with direction and distance from the pollen source plot, suggesting that bee density and distribution would not contribute to the differences in pollen dispersal among different directions. This paper is the first report on research in a large-scale experiment of pollen-mediated gene flow under the China's environmental conditions and provided scientific evidence for the effective commercialization of transgenic oilseed rape and its safe management. Our results also provided important data on pollen spatial distribution pattern. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",Herbicide resistance; Oilseed rape; Pollen dispersal; Transgenic biosafety,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749095162

Among these are important pollinators and seed dispersers. This study is a first attempt to document cascading effects on vertebrate-pollinated native plant species in Guam. We investigated flower visitation, seed set and germination in two native plants, the mangrove tree Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and the forest tree Erythrina variegata var. orientalis. Both species are bird-pollinated. Studies were conducted on two Mariana islands, Guam (with high density of snakes) and Saipan (with nearly no snakes). Visitation rates by birds were high on Saipan, but zero on Guam. Insects and lizards visited flowers to a low extent on both islands. Only lizards were potential effective pollinators. Seed set of both species were significantly higher on Saipan compared to Guam, and for B. gymnorrhiza, seedling recruitment was significantly higher on Saipan. Hence, these bird-pollinated species appear highly dependent on bird visitors for reproduction. The eradication of flower-visiting birds by the invasive treesnake thus secondarily results in broken mutualistic interactions, which may, in turn, result in a lower recruitment of native plants. Thus, the treesnake affects not only potential prey species, but its effects cascade through the entire ecosystem on Guam. Conservation actions should be directed towards an improved recruitment (artificial pollination, planting) of the affected plant species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, global mass production of buckwheat is limited because its genetic self-incompatibility results in low seed sets and poor grain yield. Therefore, this study was conducted to classify the modes of pistil-pollen interaction between species belonging to the genus Fagopyrum and to determine the optimal combination of outcrosses for the most successful pollinations. Based on the interaction between pistils and pollen, we classified the modes of pollen tube growth during interspecific crosses of Fagopyrum species into five categories: (i) Highly compatible: normal pollen tube elongation and style penetration within 6?24 hours of pollination, (ii) Slightly compatible: delayed (for 1?6 hours) pollen tube elongation and normal style penetration, (iii) Incompatible type I: pollen tube inhibition at the stigma, (iv) Incompatible type II: pollen tube inhibition at the style, and (v) Incompatible type III: pollen tube inhibition at the stylodium.

Damage and low-temperature treatment promoted the expression of MaACO1 in mulberry. In leaves, expression of the MaACO1 gene increased in cotyledons and the lowest leaves with leaf development, but showed reduced levels in emerging leaves. In flowers, the pollinated stigma showed the highest expression level, followed by the unpollinated stigma, ovary, and immature flowers.

To obtain and serve biological information for sustainable forest management, we investigated reproductive biology and inbreeding depression in seeds of an important dipterocarp tree species, Shorea acuminata (Dipterocarpaceae), by both field and laboratory experiments. Results of parental analysis of immature and mature seeds showed that selfing rates varied greatly, from 7.6 to 88.4% among eight mother trees, and the mean overall selfing rate was 38.3%. Observed outcrossing events within a 40-ha study plot were predominantly (76.5%) short-distance events with a mating distance (md) ? 100 m. Since the selfing rate sharply decreased with increase in the number of flowering conspecifics (i.e., individuals of the same species) within a 100-m radius from the mother trees, the local density of flowering conspecifics appears to be the key factor determining the outcrossing rate in S. acuminata. However, the extremely high selfing rate (88.4%) observed for one tree could not be simply explained by the low local density of flowering conspecifics. Instead, differences in its flowering phenology (its flowering peaked ca. a week earlier than most of the other examined individuals) may have severely limited its receipt of pollen from other conspecifics, and thus promoted selfing. Since there were no significant differences in the proportion of selfed progeny between immature and mature seed stages, there was no evidence of selective abortion of selfed seeds during seed development. However, the seed mass of outcrossed progeny was heavier than that of selfed progeny, and heavier seeds showed higher success rates at germination and seedling establishment. These results suggest that inbreeding depression resulted in reductions in seed mass and may reduce the fitness of selfed seeds in S. acuminata. In addition, the outcrossing rate of S. acuminata was more sensitive to low local conspecific flowering-tree densities than that of a sympatric bee-pollinated dipterocarp species with greater pollination distances. These results suggest that the management of local adult-tree densities is important for avoiding selfing and inbreeding depression in future generations, especially in a species like S. acuminata with predominantly short-distance pollination. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Wild mammals may also be behaviorally and physiologically challenged by alcohol in their food. Here, we provide a detailed account of chronic alcohol intake by mammals as part of a coevolved relationship with a plant. We discovered that seven mammalian species in a West Malaysian rainforest consume alcoholic nectar daily from flower buds of the bertam palm (Eugeissona tristis), which they pollinate. The 3.8% maximum alcohol concentration (mean: 0.6%; median: 0.5%) that we recorded is among the highest ever reported in a natural food. Nectar high in alcohol is facilitated by specialized flower buds that harbor a fermenting yeast community, including several species new to science. Pentailed treeshrews (Ptilocercus lowii) frequently consume alcohol doses from the inflorescences that would intoxicate humans. Yet, the flower-visiting mammals showed no signs of intoxication. Analysis of an alcohol metabolite (ethyl glucuronide) in their hair yielded concentrations higher than those in humans with similarly high alcohol intake. The pentailed treeshrew is considered a living model for extinct mammals representing the stock from which all extinct and living treeshrews and primates radiated. Therefore, we hypothesize that moderate to high alcohol intake was present early on in the evolution of these closely related lineages. It is yet unclear to what extent treeshrews benefit from ingested alcohol per se and how they mitigate the risk of continuous high blood alcohol concentrations. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Alcohol self-administration; Bertam palm; Nectar feeding; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749089531

This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, 'Colony Collapse Disorder'); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover. © 2008 Otterstatter et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-50649091092

First, we make use of species ecology (foundresses lay multiple clutches, with second clutches smaller than first) to show that increases in sex ratio in multi-foundress figs occur only when foundresses are oviposition site limited, i.e. that there is no direct response to foundress density. Second, we introduce a novel technique to quantify foundress oviposition sequences and show, consistent with the theoretical predictions concerning clutch size-only strategies, that they produce mainly male offspring at the start of bouts, followed by mostly females interspersed by a few males. We then discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the limits of the ability of natural selection to produce 'perfect' organisms, and for our understanding of when different cue use patterns evolve. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Cue use; Fig wasps; Local mate competition; Precision of adaptation; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949171580

Here, however, we show that nectar robbing by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)-an invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological significance-has the potential to spread through a population at the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of a flower to 'steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly promoted the development of primary robbing in previously legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically important role in the relationship between plants and pollinators. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Nectar robbing; Social information; Social transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949148132

Larvae of many solitary bees feed almost exclusively on pollen and thus could be highly exposed to transgene products expressed in the pollen. The potential effects of pollen from oilseed rape expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) were investigated on larvae of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis (= O. rufa). Furthermore, recombinant OC-1 (rOC-1), the Bt toxin Cry1Ab and the snowdrop lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) were evaluated for effects on the life history parameters of this important pollinator. Pollen provisions from transgenic OC-1 oilseed rape did not affect overall development. Similarly, high doses of rOC-1 and Cry1Ab as well as a low dose of GNA failed to cause any significant effects. However, a high dose of GNA (0.1%) in the larval diet resulted in significantly increased development time and reduced efficiency in conversion of pollen food into larval body weight. Our results suggest that OC-1 and Cry1Ab expressing transgenic crops would pose a negligible risk for O. bicomis larvae, whereas GNA expressing plants could cause detrimental effects, but only if bees were exposed to high levels of the protein.

Among the bee group, the tribe Meliponini (stingless bees) has some distinction due to its Pantropical distribution, great number of species and large importance as main pollinators in several ecosystems, including the Brazilian rain forest. However few molecular studies have been conducted on this group of bees and few sequence data from mitochondrial genomes have been described. In this project, we PCR amplified and sequenced 78% of the mitochondrial genome of the stingless bee Melipona bicolor (Apidae, Meliponini). The sequenced region contains all of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, 18 of 22 tRNA genes, and both rRNA genes (one of them was partially sequenced). We also report the genome organization (gene content and order), gene translation, genetic code, and other molecular features, such as base frequencies, codon usage, gene initiation and termination. We compare these characteristics of M. bicolorto those of the mitochondrial genome of A. mellifera and other insects. A highly biased A+T content is a typical characteristic of the A. mellifera mitochondrial genome and it was even more extreme in that of M. bicolor. Length and compositional differences between M. bicolor and A. mellifera genes were detected and the gene order was compared. Eleven tRNA gene translocations were observed between these two species. This latter finding was surprising, considering the taxonomic proximity of these two bee tribes. The tRNALys gene translocation was investigated within Meliponini and showed high conservation across the Pantropical range of the tribe.

The goal of this study was to characterize the pollination and breeding systems of five Puerto Rican Gesneria species. • Methods: The study was conducted in Arecibo and El Yunke National Forest, Puerto Rico, between 2003 and 2007. Floral visitors were documented by human observers and video cameras. Floral longevity and nectar production were recorded for the five study species. Tests for self-compatibility and autonomous selfing were conducted through hand-pollination and bagging experiments. • Key Results: Floral phenology and nectar production schedules agree with nocturnal (in bell-shaped flowered G. pedunculosa and G. viridiflora subsp. sintenisii) or diurnal pollination syndromes (in tubular-flowered G. citrina, G. cuneifolia and G. reticulata). Nectar concentration is consistently low (8-13%) across species. Gesneria citrina and G. cuneifolia are exclusively pollinated by hummingbirds, while Gesneria reticulata relies mostly on autonomous self-pollination, despite having classic ornithophilous flowers. A variety of floral visitors was recorded for the two species with bell-shaped flowers; however, not all visitors have the ability to transfer pollen. Bats are the primary pollinators of G. pedunculosa, with bananaquits probably acting as secondary pollinators. For G. viridiflora subsp. sintenisii, both bats and hummingbirds contact the flower's reproductive organs, thus, this species is considered to be a generalist despite its nocturnal floral syndrome. All species are self-compatible but only tubular-flowered Gesneria are capable of autonomous self-pollination. • Conclusions: The visitation patterns described in this study fit the predicted hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes and support both specialization and generalization of pollination systems in Puerto Rican Gesneria. Specialization is associated with low pollinator visitation, particularly by hummingbirds, which may explain the occurrence of autonomous selfing mechanisms in tubular-flowered species. © The Author 2008.

Disterigma stereophyllum is a neotropical Ericaceae with floral characteristics intermediate between the 'entomophilous' syndrome and the 'ornithophilous' syndrome: the corolla is short, white and urceolate, but flowers produce large amounts of dilute nectar. We studied the pollination ecology of this species in south-western Colombia, and found it to be pollinated almost exclusively by hummingbirds at our study site. Two hummingbird species were responsible for about 75 of visits. Despite the fact that nectar standing crop remained more or less constant throughout the day, visit frequencies were highest in the morning and declined throughout the day. Pollinator efficiency, measured as the number of pollen grains deposited on a virgin stigma by each visitor after one visit, did not differ among the species of hummingbirds, but was lower for a nectar-robbing bird, Diglossa albilatera. This species does not contact the surface of the stigma during nectar robbing, but can produce some self-pollination indirectly because it shakes branches vigorously while piercing the flower. These findings indicate a need for further studies of neotropical Ericaceae in order to elucidate whether floral visitors of species like D. stereophyllum fluctuate through time or space, and whether floral characteristics reflect a compromise between such different visitors, or a transitional stage between pollination syndromes, or some other possibility. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Colombia; Ericaceae; Hummingbird pollination; Mixed pollination systems; Pollination syndromes; Pollinator efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45149118532

The pollination ecology of Silene maritima was investigated. Flowers on stalks of different waviness were used to investigate the effect of floral movement on pollinator visits. There is heritable variation in both direct and indirect estimates of floral mobility. The highest insect total visitation times were associated with medium length thin stalks that were visited more frequently and by more insect species. Although mean individual visit durations were less than those of less mobile flowers, this was compensated for by increased visits. Observations of controlled pollinations show that when the visit times are low, so is seed set and therefore low and high mobility flowers might suffer from reduced fitness. Combining these observations provides a mechanism that could be driving stabilizing selection for flower stalk traits, with a trade-off applying between waving to attract pollinators and not being too mobile as to prevent effective pollination. Further evidence for stabilizing selection is provided by the relationship observed in the field between seed set and floral mobility where the highest levels of fitness was associated with intermediate levels of floral waving. © 2008 The Authors.",Floral movement; Flower stalk; Pollination; Silene maritima; Stabilizing selection; Wavy flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45149083616

We examined the potential pollination of this orchid by the recently naturalized orchid bee (Euglossa viridissima), recorded as a pollinator of the orchid in tropical America, and found that this orchid bee is not a pollinator of the plant. We sought to learn what is responsible for relatively heavy fruit set in a Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden population of C. punctatum, and determined that the native oil-collecting bee, Centris errans, is the most important pollinator. C. punctatum flowers at Fairchild have 18 times the fruit set of flowers in Everglades National Park. The difference is probably due to the many species and individuals of oil-reward plants in the Malpighiaceae in the garden, compared to one uncommon native species in the park. Female C. errans visit these oil-reward flowers to obtain edible oils to provision their brood. Cyrtopodium flowers appear to mimic the oil-reward flowers of the Malpighiaceae to attract Centris bee pollinators, much as many Oncidium orchids do in tropical America. We recommend that Brysonima lucida, a rare native malpighiaceous shrub, and C. punctatum be planted together in Everglades National Park and other natural areas to attempt to increase C. errans pollination, to restore and enhance the long-term survival of the orchid. Planting model malpighiaceous plants to enhance Centris bee pollination may be a useful restoration tactic for other rare orchid mimics in the American tropics, including Atlantic Forest in Brazil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",Centris; Euglossa; Floral mimicry; Oil-reward,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749135130

Introduced pollinators might competitively displace their native counterparts, which in turn affects the pollination of native plants, if native and alien visitors differ in pollinator effectiveness. Since its invasion in 1994 into south-west Argentina, the introduced European bumblebee Bombus ruderatus has continuously increased in abundance, along with a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of the native Bombus dahlbomii. The latter is the only native bumblebee species of the temperate forests of southern South America, and the main pollinator of the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea. In order to evaluate the impact of the ongoing displacement of the native by the alien bumblebee, we compared the pollinator effectiveness (i.e., the combination of pollinator efficiency per visit and visitation frequency) between both bumblebee species, as well as related pollinator traits that might account for potential differences in pollinator efficiency. Native Bombus dahlbomii, which has a larger body and spent more time per flower, was the more efficient pollinator compared to Bombus ruderatus, both in terms of quantity and quality of pollen deposited per visit. However, Bombus ruderatus was a much more frequent flower visitor than Bombus dahlbomii. As a consequence, Bombus ruderatus is nowadays a more effective pollinator of A. aurea than its native congener. Despite the lack of evidence of an increase in seed set at the population level, comparisons with historical records of Bombus dahlbomii abundances prior to Bombus ruderatus' invasion suggest that the overall pollination intensity of A. aurea might in fact have risen as a consequence of this invasion. Field experiments like these, that incorporate the natural variation in abundance of native and alien species, are powerful means to demonstrate that the consequences of invasions are more complex than previous manipulated and controlled experiments have suggested. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Alstroemeria aurea; Bombus dahlbomii; Bombus ruderatus; Introduced species; Pollinator effectiveness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949106448

In 2003 and 2004, six field experiments on cross-pollination were carried out in the cantons of Zug and Zurich, two hilly regions of Switzerland. Three (Monopol, Romario and PR39G12) color-dominant yellow-grain maize varieties (Zea mays L.) were planted in close proximity (0.8 m) to color-recessive white-grain maize (DSP17007). The factors of influence were size of the donor and receptor parts of the field and flower synchrony, tested in a tight grid pattern (2.4 m × 10 m; 6000 ears ha-1). Widely varying field size ratios of donors to receptors (about 4:1-1:8) did not influence the cross-pollination rate at distances of 0-20 m from the pollen donor. The synchrony between pollen shedding of the donor and silking of the receptor had a large impact on cross-pollination. In relation to the mid-phase of silk emergence in the receptor field, a temporal isolation of five and seven days resulted in a significant decrease in cross-pollination by more than 80% in comparison to full synchrony. However, in a receptor field with irregular emergence of a number of weak, late-flowering plants led to a remarkable increase in cross-pollination, despite an average temporal separation of 7 days. Marked cross-pollination was restricted to distances up to 15 m; thus, average rates of cross-pollination above 0.9% were easily managed in small fields. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, most studies on this issue focus on bees, while other invertebrate taxa are largely ignored. We investigated the pollination efficiency of the globally abundant hover fly Episyrphus balteatus on the common crop, oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The study was conducted over a period of 2 consecutive years by means of enclosure experiments at an agricultural site located in Central Hesse (Germany). E. balteatus significantly increased both seed set and yield. This effect was very constant in the 2 years, despite considerable interannual differences in total seed numbers and seed mass. It highlights the important role of hover flies as pollinators of arable crops under varying environmental conditions. In contrast to bees, the effect of E. balteatus was lower at high pollinator densities than at low pollinator densities. This suggests adverse effects of density-dependent factors on pollination efficiency at high densities. Thus, models ignoring the modulating effect of biotic interactions by generally assuming a simple positive relationship between pollinator density and pollination efficiency might not apply to a vital component of the pollinator community. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Canola; Generalists; Pollination; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949094601

By conducting cospeciation analyses between figs of section Galoglychia and some of their associated fig wasps, we show that, although host switches and duplication have evidently played a role in the construction of the current associations, the global picture is one of significant cospeciation throughout the evolution of these communities. Contrary to common belief, nonpollinating wasps are at least as constrained as pollinators by their host association in their diversification in this section. By adapting a randomization test in a supertree context, we further confirm that wasp phylogenies are significantly congruent with each other, and build a ""wasp community"" supertree that retrieves Galoglychia taxonomic subdivisions. Altogether, these results probably reflect wasp host specialization but also, to some extent, they might indicate that niche saturation within the fig prevents recurrent intrahost speciation and host switching.

Post-diapausing M. rotundata maintain a supercooling capacity below -23°C until pupation, after which all developmental stages freeze between -15°C and -17°C. Fed and unfed adult females show significant differences in their supercooling capacity; -8°C and -16°C, respectively.

Such systems are indicative of evolutionary specialization and have been important in angiosperm diversification. We studied the evolution of pollination systems in the large genus Ruellia. Phylogenetic analyses, morphological ordinations, ancestral state reconstructions, and a character mapping simulation were conducted to reveal key patterns in the direction and lability of floral characters associated with pollination. We found significant floral morphological differences among species that were generally associated with different groups of floral visitors. Floral evolution has been highly labile and also directional. Some specialized systems such as hawkmoth or bat pollination are likely evolutionary dead-ends. In contrast, specialized pollination by hummingbirds is clearly not a dead-end. We found evidence for multiple reverse transitions from presumed ancestral hummingbird pollination to more derived bee or insect pollination. These repeated origins of insect pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors have not evolved without historical baggage. Flowers of insect-pollinated species derived from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors are morphologically more similar to hummingbird flowers than they are to other more distantly related insect-pollinated flowers. Finally, some pollinator switches were concomitant with changes in floral morphology that are associated with those pollinators. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that some transitions have been adaptive in the evolution of Ruellia. © 2008 The Author(s).",Dollo's law; Flower; Generalist; Pollinator; Specialist; Syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47349084553

Unequal male reproductive success and three types of potential pedigree errors (volunteers, mishandled maternal identities, and foreign pollen) were detected in operational open-pollinated and polycross red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) progeny tests, through paternity testing using microsatellite (simple sequence repeat) DNA markers.

Pollination accelerates corolla senescence and associated wilting symptoms are observed within 48 h. This pollination-accelerated corolla senescence was not observed in transgenic petunias with reduced ethylene sensitivity (35S{proportion}etr1-1). The growth of the pollinated etr1-1 ovary physically separated the corolla from the receptacle and the corolla was shed. Under most conditions the growing ovary resulted in the separation of a nearly turgid corolla. When this occurred, the up-regulation of the senescence specific cysteine protease, PhCP10, and the endonuclease, PhNUC1, was not detected. While a reduction in the N, P, and K content of the corollas accompanied the senescence of wild type MD flowers, a similar decrease was not detected in etr1-1 corollas. Lowering production temperatures increased the time until pollinated etr1-1 corollas were shed, and the growing ovary did not begin to separate the corolla from the receptacle until after the petals were wilting. Senescence was induced in wilted etr1-1 corollas, as evidenced by the induction of PhCP10 gene expression and PhNUC1 activity. A reduction in the macronutrient content of the wilted, pollinated etr1-1 corollas was also observed, although P levels were not reduced as much as in pollinated MD flowers. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Similar fruit set was obtained after autonomous, within-flower, and between-flower self-pollination (0.35, 0.53, and 0.46, respectively), crosspollination (0.45), and control (0.39). Seed set and seed mass did not differ significantly between pollination treatments (P > 0:05). Autonomous self-pollination was favored at the end of floral anthesis, when the petals fell and the sepals closed and pushed the anthers onto the stigma, making contact. No pollinators were seen visiting the flowers during the 42-h observation period, and the stigmatic pollen load on open-pollinated flowers, collected after the petals had fallen and before anther and stigma contact had occurred, was not enough to fertilize all the ovules. Low levels of inbreeding depression were found for fruit set (? = -0:167), seed set (? = -0:086), seed mass (? = 0:008), and seed germination (? = -0:052). These results support the idea that F. juniperina is selfcompatible and capable of autonomous self-pollination through changes in the position of the stigma and anthers at the end of floral anthesis. This is a case of how delayed selfing can be an efficient mating strategy that ensures reproduction in this plant when pollinators are scarce. This is the first time that a mechanism of delayed selfing has been described within the family Cistaceae. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Vernalized seedlings were transferred to a greenhouse set to 30/18 C day/night temperatures and 16-h photoperiod. Growth stages on all plants were recorded twice a week. All spring wheat and spring wheat related hybrid plants reproduced (as measured by the first reproductive node) in the absence of vernalization. Plants of jointed goatgrass population A-R, winter wheat, and winter wheat related hybrids were unlikely to reproduce in the absence of vernalization. Plants of jointed goatgrass populations B-W, G-S, E-S, and F-W reproduced in the absence of vernalization, and the likelihood that these plants would reproduce was different from all other plants. Plants that entered their reproductive phases together were not in synchronous development at anthesis. Plants in these studies differentially passed through the reproductive phases between the first reproductive node and anthesis. Our results demonstrate that variation in vernalization response exists among several jointed goatgrass populations, and reveal that the reproductive behavior of vernalized jointed goatgrass plants at anthesis is delayed compared to vernalized winter wheat and related hybrid plants. Hybrid plants produced between spring wheat and jointed goatgrass were vernalization insensitive. We hypothesize that hybridization between wheat and jointed goatgrass occurs as a result of cross-pollination between the younger reproductive tillers of jointed goatgrass and older reproductive tillers of wheat.

Genes corresponding to ethylene biosynthesis in orchid reproductive organs have been identified and characterized. The phosphorylation states of proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene signaling may be correlated with ovule development.

The variability of fruit and seeds was studied in another 12 Iberian populations with respect to certain meteorological parameters (temperature and rainfall). Anagyris foetida shows cauliflory, marked floral longevity, and adichogamy. The peak of flowering is in January-February. It is self-compatible, with no clear advantage of cross- over self-pollination, and with virtually no autonomous self-pollination. This is because the stigma, like some other legumes, prevents the germination of pollen if its surface is not ruptured by pollinators.

Geographical variation was studied in leaves and flowers of Embothrium coccineum, a species that grows along abrupt environmental gradients and exhibits contrasting pollinator assemblages in the southern Andes. • Methods: Five foliar and eight floral morphological characters were considered from 32 populations, and their patterns of variation and covariation were analysed within and among populations, together with their relationship with environmental variables, using both univariate and multivariate methods. The relationships between foliar and floral morphological variation and geographical distance between populations were compared with Mantel permutation tests. • Key Results: Leaf and flower traits were clearly uncoupled within populations and weakly associated among populations. Whereas geographical variation in foliar traits was mostly related to differences in precipitation associated with geographical longitude, variation in floral traits was not. • Conclusions: These patterns suggest that leaves and flowers responded to different evolutionary forces, environmental (i.e. rainfall) in the case of leaves, and biotic (i.e. pollinators) or genetic drift in the case of flowers. This study supports the view that character divergence at a geographical scale can be moulded by different factors acting in an independent fashion. © The Author 2008.

For example, aboveground floral visitors provide pollination services, while belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient capture. Traditionally in ecology, these processes were studied in isolation, reinforcing the prevailing assumption that these above- and belowground processes were also functionally distinct. More recently, there has been a growing realization that the soil surface is not a barrier to many ecological interactions, particularly those involving plants (who live simultaneously above and below ground). Because of the potentially large impact that mycorrhizae and floral visitors can have on plant performance and community dynamics, we designed an experiment to test whether these multi-species mutualisms were interdependent under field conditions. Using benomyl, a widely used fungicide, we suppressed AMF in a native grassland, measuring plant, fungal, and floral-visitor responses after three years of fungal suppression. AMF suppression caused a shift in the community of floral visitors from large-bodied bees to small-bodied bees and flies, and reduced the total number of floral visits per flowering stem 67% across the 23 flowering species found in the plots. Fungal suppression has species-specific effects on floral visits for the six most common flowering plants in this experiment. Exploratory analyses suggest these results were due to changes in floral-visitor behavior due to altered patch-level floral display, rather than through direct effects of AMF suppression on floral morphology. Our findings indicate that AMF are an important, and overlooked, driver of floral-visitor community structure with the potential to affect pollination services. These results support the growing body of research indicating that interactions among ecological interactions can be of meaningful effect size under natural field conditions and may influence individual performance, population dynamics, and community structure. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Alberta; Aspen parkland; Canada; Community ecology; Grassland; Indirect interactions; Interactions at multiple trophic levels; Kinsella; Mutualisms; Mycorrhizae; Plant-soil interactions; Pollination biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54549111939

Nectary structure and nectar production dynamics were also examined. Produced in the fused anther tubes, the trinucleate pollen with yellow pollenkitt was plentiful per floret, yielding a pollen : ovule ratio of 24,130. Encircling the style base at the ovary summit, the floral nectary possessed modified stomata whose pores, as well as nonstomatal gaps in the epidermis, provided apoplastic pathways for nectar escape and reabsorption. Phloem alone supplied the gland interior, the sieve element-companion cell complexes reaching up to the nectary epidermis.

Because the flower has only a single chance to become pollinated, floral structures and processes have to be precisely synorganized and synchronized. In this article, Calathea lutea, Calathea platystachya, Pleiostachya pruinosa (all Calathea clade), and Hylaeanthe hoffmannii (Maranta clade) from Costa Rica are investigated. Pollen is transferred from the anther to the style in late-bud stages. Depending on the arrangement of the respective parts, self-pollination in the bud is likely in P. pruinosa but is excluded in C. lutea. After pollen deposition, the buds elongate to twice their length, inducing the style's tension by differential growth. The representatives of the Calathea clade show a high mechanical tensioning of the backward-bent style (referred to as ""additional tension"" here). The four species differ in their floral structures in terms of the specific swellings and appendages of the hooded staminode, the position and shape of the trigger appendage, and the bending of the style. The specific utility of each of the novelties is explained, implying that the range of floral responses is much higher than the functional need. The species also differ in the sensitivity of the style release. Calathea lutea has the most robust flowers, followed by C. platystachya. Pleiostachya pruinosa has the most sensitive flowers, in which the style is usually releasing itself. Hylaeanthe hoffmannii differs from the three species in having a modified trigger structure, an almost straight instead of an overarched style, and less elaborate staminodes. The differences among the two groups are interpreted as a phylogenetic signal referring to the preliminary hypothesis that individual clades in the Marantaceae evolved different mechanical and electrophysiological constructions to hold the style under tension. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Genetic variation is a prerequisite for evolutionary response to environmental changes. However, few studies have evaluated the genetic structure of restored populations of dominant plants. In this study, we compared genetic variation of the restored populations with the natural ones in Cyclobalanopsis myrsinaefolia, a dominant species of evergreen broadleaved forest. Using eight polymorphic microsatellite loci, we analyzed samples collected from restored populations and the donor population as well as two other natural populations. We compared the genetic diversity of restored and natural populations. Differences in genetic composition were evaluated using measurements of genetic differentiation and assignment tests. The mean number of alleles per locus was 4.65. Three parameters (A, AR, and expected heterozygosity) of genetic variation were found to be lower, but not significantly, in the restored populations than they were in the natural populations, indicating a founder effect during the restoration. Significant but low FST (0.061) was observed over all loci, indicating high gene flow among populations, as expected from its wind-pollination. Differentiation between the two restored populations was smallest. However, differences between the donor population and the restored populations were higher than those between other natural populations and the restored populations. Only 13.5% and 25.7% individuals in the two restored populations were assigned to the donor population, but 54.1 and 40% were assigned to another natural population. The genetic variation of the donor population was lowest, and geographic distances from the restoration sites to the donor site were much higher than the other natural populations, indicating that the present donor likely was not the best donor for these ecological restoration efforts. However, no deleterious consequences might be observed in restored populations due to high observed heterozygosity and high gene flow. This study demonstrates that during the restoration process, genetic structures of the restored populations may be biased from the donor population. The results also highlight population genetic knowledge, especially of gene flow-limited species, in ecological restoration. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cyclobalanopsis myrsinaefolia; Ecological restoration; Evergreen broadleaved forest; Genetic differentiation; Genetic diversity; Microsatellites,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44349156636

I studied floral morphology, nectar rewards and pollinator visitation for Penstemon newberryi, P. davidsonii and their hybrids along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada of California. Sixty-two floral visitor species were observed visiting plants, making this system highly generalized compared to previous studies of visitation in hybrid zones. Morphological measurements were used to construct a plant hybrid index and examine the correlation with elevation and with floral visitors. Using observations of floral visitors along the gradient, I performed an ordination to determine whether the pollinator community changed along with plant morphology. Plants varied in a clinal pattern along the elevational gradient. The visitor community varied incrementally with altitude, although visitors to Penstemon davidsonii were separated from those to P. newberryi and hybrids along the main ordination axis. Hummingbirds were only found at low and middle elevations, and small halictid bees were relatively more abundant at high elevations. Although there is some potential for ecological isolation in the pollinator community, 11 common pollinator species visited both parent species and could be contributing to hybrid formation. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47749105343

Corona charging is used to charge the pollen cloud, which is then transported in an air stream. In the present study, an electrostatic ring (ESR) that reduces the amount of free ions and facilitates the penetration of the charged pollen was constructed and tested. An artificial tree was constructed and laboratory experiments were conducted to test and enhance the performance of the device. The results show that although electrostatic charging can enhance pollen deposition 28-fold, the ESR can increase it by a further 46% on a whole tree and by 83% on its internal parts. It was also found that the location of the ESR can drastically influence the amount of pollen deposition: for a given setup, with the ESR located at the electrode edge (0 mm) the pollen deposition was 76% higher than when it was located 40 mm behind the edge. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We addressed these issues using Lobelia cardinalis, a native, hummingbird-pollinated species, which is available horticulturally both as wild types and cultivated varieties. Potential pollen and gene flow between relatively isolated populations were measured in an artificial array experiment. Potted plants were placed at discrete distances (50, 100, 500, and 1000 m) from either a local or one of three non-local potted pollen sources and scored for pollen and gene flow. Pollen movement was assessed with a dye analogue. The pollen source population did not significantly influence the results, but dye movement, fruit set, and to a lesser degree fruit volume declined with distance from the pollen source. Even at 1 km away from the pollen source, 20-50% of flowers set fruit, indicating substantial gene movement. Siring ability of four non-local pollen types on local plants was assessed by comparing paternity success when each type comprised 75, 50, and 25% of the pollen in controlled mixed load pollinations. Pollen type affected the percentage of non-local offspring. A cultivated variety of L. cardinalis showed poor siring success on the Virginia maternal plants at all mix ratios. Mating was random in mixes with Virginia pollen and pollen from geographically distant wild-type varieties. Finally, pollen from a neighboring county was significantly favored over local sires. These results demonstrate that pollen movement from horticultural plantings into native populations and the production of hybrid seed on native plants is possible in L. cardinalis. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Crop-to-wild gene flow; Gene flow; Pollen competition; Pollen flow; Siring ability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44349108482

In the present study, the fruit set of six perennial species belonging to the Aizoaceae was investigated under two different grazing intensities. Two species (Cheiridopsis imitans and Leipoldtia schultzei) were examined more closely to determine whether factors other than grazing impact fruit production of these plants. Apart from reproductive output, the population structure of these two species was explored in heavily and slightly grazed areas. For all investigated species, heavy livestock grazing was identified as a major threat to fruit production. Deviations from this pattern were recorded in a drought year, when harsh weather conditions reduced herd sizes dramatically and the usually high grazing pressure was alleviated. However, detailed analyses revealed that also other biotic factors can cause severe fruit and flower losses even exceeding that caused by grazing. Caterpillars of the noctuid moth, Diaphone eumela, and two rodent species, Otomys unisulcatus and Rhabdomys pumilio, proved to be further important herbivores of flowers and fruits. Experiments with caged plants, excluding livestock from grazing, confirmed though that livestock grazing definitely accounts for a continuous reduction of fruit production. Insufficient pollination success was another parameter reducing fruit set; however, this was almost exclusively observed under low grazing pressure. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Cheiridopsis imitans; Herbivory; Lack of pollination; Land use; Leipoldtia schultzei; Livestock exclusion; Population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44449141390

Finally, using experimental populations, we tested whether female fitness responds to the frequency of female plants. We found broad variability in sex ratio among populations (0-44% female). Hermaphrodite flowers received more pollinator visits and pollen grains than females, and bagged hermaphrodite flowers produced fruits. However, we found no evidence of pollen limitation in females.

Co-occurring plant species that share pollinators have the potential to facilitate pollination by either increasing numbers of pollinator visits or increasing the quality of visits, but also have the potential to reduce plant reproductive success through competition for pollination. I used a field experiment with a common distylous perennial (Piriqueta caroliniana) in the presence and absence of a co-flowering species (Coreopsis leavenworthii) in plots with one of four different distances between conspecific plants. I found strong negative effects of increasing interplant distance (related to conspecific density) on several components of P. caroliniana reproductive success: pollinator visits to plants per plot visit, visits received by individual plants, conspecific pollen grains on stigmas, outcross pollen grains on stigmas, and probability of fruit production. Although P. caroliniana and C. leavenworthii share pollinators, the co-flowering species did not affect visitation, pollen receipt or reproductive effort in P. caroliniana. Pollinators moved very infrequently between species in this experiment, so floral constancy might explain the lack of effect of the co-flowering species on P. caroliniana reproductive success at low densities. In co-occurring self-incompatible plants with floral rewards, reproductive success at low density may depend more on conspecific densities than on the presence of other species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Allee effect; Co-flowering; Density; Pollen receipt; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949100588

The following factors were considered: survival, growth (free growth, height, diameter, volume, height/diameter ratio), form (number of branches, number of whorls, number of branches per whorl, number of branches per tree height meter, number of ramicorn branches, diameter of the thickest branch, internode length, branch angle, stem straightness, stem sinuosity, number of forks) and resistance (frost and insect resistance). Each plantation contained 50 female parents that had been selected as plus trees in genetically unimproved plantations in Galicia, as well as 6 female parents selected from the radiata pine breeding programme in the Basque Country (northern Spain) and two commercial lots of seed from Galicia, as controls. Individual heritabilities varied from low to high levels for each trait studied. Family heritabilities followed similar trends for individual heritabilities, but were of much greater magnitude. The results suggested that all traits except the number of branches per whorl and insect resistance could be expected to respond to selection based on individual performance. The less heritable traits could be improved by progeny testing. Height and diameter were strongly and positively correlated, and both traits were also correlated with the number of branches, the number of whorls and the branch diameter. The results are compared with previously published data and discussed in relation to the implications for breeding activities. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",Breeding programme; Heritability; Juvenile selection traits; Phenotypic and genetic correlation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45549093308

Floral biomass was allocated mainly to the corolla (attraction) which, together with the presence of herkogamy and protandry, favors out-crossing. Nevertheless, it is self-compatible and partially autogamous due to the position of anthers above the stigma. Foraging behavior of pollinators could also facilitate deposition of self pollen on the stigma. Ovule abortion was the main predispersal loss of potential seed production, closely followed by flower and fruit abortion. Predispersal seed predation and seed abortion were relatively low.

AFLP and ISSR were used to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of eight populations from across its known distribution. Three AFLP and ten ISSR primer combinations produced a total of 203 and 77 unambiguous and repeatable bands respectively, of which 164 (80.8%) and 67 (87.0%) were polymorphic for the two markers. These two markers showed that Litsea szemaois exhibits comparatively high genetic diversity at species level (heterozygosity (hs) = 0.2109) relative to some other Lauraceae. Most of the genetic variation was partitioned within populations, but genetic differentiation between populations was significant and relatively high (? st = 0.2420, ?B= 0.1986) compared with other tropical plants. The genetic characteristics of L. szemaois may be related to its outbreeding system, insect pollination and fragmented distribution. Because L. szemaois is dioecious and slow to mature, ex situ conservation across its genetic diversity is unlikely to succeed, although seedlings grow well under cultivation. Thus, in situ conservation is very important for this endangered species, especially as only 133 adult individuals are known in the wild. In particular, the Nabanhe and Mandian populations should be given a high conservation priority due to their higher genetic diversity, larger population size and better field condition, but wider sampling is required across all populations to determine additional areas with significant genetic conservation value. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",AFLP; Endangered species; Genetic diversity; ISSR; Litsea szemaois; Population differentiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48349091275

When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species population change. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Bombus spp.; Ecosystem services; Food preference; Foraging behavior; Historical collections; Invasive plants; Land use change; Pollination; Rare species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54549120238

Individual relative MRS can be estimated through paternity analysis and can be further dissected into fecundity and spatial components. Existing methods to achieve this decomposition either rely on the strong assumption of a random distribution of pollen donors (TwoGener) or estimate only the part of the variance of male fecundity that is explained by few covariates. We developed here a method to estimate jointly the whole variance of male fecundity and the pollen dispersal curve from the genotypic information of sampled seeds and their putative fathers and geographical information of all individuals in the study area. We modelled the relative individual fecundities as a log-normally distributed random effect. We used a Bayesian approach, well suited to the hierarchical nature of the model, to estimate these fecundities. When applied to Sorbus torminalis, the estimated variance of male fecundity corresponded to an effective density of trees 13 times lower than the observed density (d obs/dep? 13). This value is between the value (?2) estimated with a classical mating model including three covariates (neighbourhood density, diameter, flowering intensity) that affect fecundity and the value (?30) estimated with TwoGener. The estimated dispersal kernel was close to previous results. This approach allows fine monitoring of ongoing genetic drift in natural populations, and quantitative dissection of the processes contributing to drift, including human actions. © 2008 The Authors.",Bayesian approach; Long-distance dispersal; Mating system; Microsatellite markers; Mixed mating models; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47749091220

However, the sterility of the Polima (pol) CMS lines is sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Also, traces of pollen can cause self-pollination within the CMS lines, which results in reduced levels of F1 hybrid seed purity and leads to a significant yield loss. Self-incompatibility (SI) is another important approach for hybrid seed production in rapeseed. Despite having a wide range of restorers and being easily selected in a breeding program, SI system has some drawbacks. In this study, SI genes from a self-incompatible line of Brassica napus were transferred to a pol CMS line and S372A, a novel line of combined cytoplasmic male sterility with self-incompatibility was bred. Due to the SI genes, this line produced very few seeds when it was selfed at low temperature and no seeds at high temperature. This suggested that the line with CMS + SI had combined the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of both the pol CMS and SI systems. Furthermore, our results showed that most of the maintainers and all the restorers of the pol CMS system were also maintainers and restorers of the CMS + SI line, respectively. This indicates that the CMS + SI system can be easily used to establish three-line hybrids of rapeseed, and we believe this novel system could be extended to other species of Brassica. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica napus L.; Cytoplasmic male sterility; F1 hybrid seed production; Heterosis; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44749083504

The number of hybrids found in the artificial populations together with results of earlier studies indicate that insect visits and cross-pollination in small-flowered Euphrasia species in lower alpine regions may be more common than has been suggested in the past. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Discriminant analyses; Euphrasia minima; Euphrasia salisburgensis; Field experiment; Hybridization; Insect behavior; Introgression; RAPD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48349136245

Reciprocal crosses were carried out between three B. rapa L. ssp. oleifera varieties (AA) and five accessions of B. oleracea var. acephala (CC). All the parental lines were yellow-seeded except one accession of B. oleracea. Hybrids were obtained through either ovary culture from crosses B. rapa x B. oleracea, or embryo culture from crosses B. oleracea x B. rapa. A higher rate of hybrid production was recorded when ovaries were cultured at 4-7 days after pollination (DAP). Of different culture media, medium E (MS with half strength macronutrients) showed good response for ovaries from all the crosses, the highest rate of hybrid production reaching 45% in B. rapa (1151) x B. oleracea (T2). In embryo culture, the hybrid rate was significantly enhanced at 16-18 DAP, up to 48.1% in B. oleracea (T3) x B. rapa (JB2). The combinations of optimal DAP for excision and media components increased recovery of hybrids for ovary and embryo culture, and constituted an improved technique for B. rapa x B. oleracea crosses. In addition, yellow seeds were obtained from progenies of two crosses, indicating the feasibility of developing yellow-seeded B. napus through the hybridization between yellow-seeded diploids B. rapa and B. oleracea var. acephala. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",B. rapa; Brassica oleracea var. acephala; Embryo culture; Ovary culture; Synthetic Brassica napus; Yellow seed color,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44849122015

The plantlets formed rhizomes following transfer to half-strength MS medium without PGRs, and acclimatized plants were easily established. Subsequently, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system was applied. The suspension cells were co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens strain EHA101/pIG121Hm or LBA4404/pTOK233, both of which contain neomycin phosphotransferase II, hygromycin phosphotransferase and intron-containing ß-glucuronidase (intron-GUS) genes. Seven days after co-cultivation, the cells were subjected to GUS assay; staining was most pronounced in the cells subcultured in a picloram-containing liquid medium and co-cultivated with EHA101/pIG121Hm. The co-cultivated cells were transferred to the MS medium containing picloram and 20 mg l-1 hygromycin; 1 month later, several hygromycin-resistant callus lines showing GUS activity were obtained.

When the discs presented contrast to the long-wavelength-sensitive (L) receptor, grouping of disks improved the detectability. The disks were optically resolvable for the honeybee eye. The improvement of detectability was stronger for bumblebees than for honeybees. When disks did not present contrast to the L-receptor, the grouping did not improve the detectability, i.e. the detection limit was set by the size of a single disk. We conclude that in bees the neural mechanisms that improve detectability of grouped elements require input from the L-receptor.

Its reproductive biology, specifically, floral functional morphology, growth and behavior of the style during anthesis, and style morphology, was studied in an open M. micrantha population in South China during the flowering seasons of 2004 and 2005. Floral biology was studied in detail by examining florets at different developmental stages under a dissecting microscope and a scanning electron microscope. Stigma receptivity and pollen viability was determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] staining technique. The results show that M. micrantha is protandrous and has a secondary pollen presentation system which characterizes the family Asteraceae. Typically, the flowering period is 6 days and can be divided into six floral stages (A, B, C, D, E and F) based on style morphology and behaviour. At the beginning of anthesis, the style bends to break and enter the tube formed by five fused anthers. Later, the style protrudes the anther tube and moves the pollen out from the anther. During anthesis, two partially overlapping phases, functionally male phase and functionally female phase, can be distinguished by MTT tests: the former is from stage B to D, and the latter is stage E. The style has two style branches in its terminal part. The sweeping hairs, which act as pollen presenter, are located on the tips and on the upper parts of the style branches forming developed stylar appendages. The stigmatic papillae are separated into two ventro-marginal bands along each style branch in symmetric arrangement. The bending behavior of the style and the sweeping hairs play an important role in presenting pollen to pollinator.",Invasive plant; Mikania micrantha; Secondary pollen presentation; Sweeping hairs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53649091756

Over 2,000 pollinations were made to obtain these hybrids. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis showed that in the most studied hybrid (WA2273), 4% of the bands unique to the M. arborea parent were present, versus 72% for the unique M. sativa bands. This suggests that only a single M. arborea chromosome or chromosome parts has been transferred. WA2273 had 7% of AFLP bands which were not present in either parent, which is suggestive of chromosome rearrangements as would be expected if only chromosome parts or a single part had been transferred from M. arborea. Phenotypic evidence for hybridity was obtained for pod coiling (1.4 coils in WA2273 versus three coils in the M. sativa parent and its self and testcross populations, and one coil in M. arborea), and Colletotrichum trifolii race 2 resistance (transferred from the resistant M. arborea parent, as the M. sativa parent and the self populations were highly susceptible). The hybrids were self sterile, but were female fertile to a high level when crossed with 4x, but not 2x, M. sativa, indicating they were at or near 4x. Both the pod coiling trait and anthracnose resistance segregated in the progeny of testcrosses between WA2273 and M. sativa.

In this study, we ask how plant and habitat characteristics traditionally thought to attract pollinators are related to attack rates by floral herbivores. Patterns of floral herbivory by the moth larva Eupithecia pulchellata were studied in relation to inflorescence size and local plant density in two years in a natural population of the facultative biennial Digitalis purpurea. Overall levels of herbivory were low, 84% of the infested plants lost less than 10% of their flowers. Only 9% of the plants lost more than 20% of their flowers. Probability of herbivory at the plant level increased strongly with inflorescence height, and it was considerably higher in dense patches compared to sparse ones. There was no effect of local plant density on the functional relationship between inflorescence size and probability of herbivory. Both number and proportion of damaged flowers per plant increased with inflorescence height. The results suggest that E. pulchellata is attracted to dense patches and large individuals of D. purpurea, and that negative effects of herbivory increase with plant size. This implies diminishing returns for investment in more flowers in D. purpurea, and indicates that herbivory may select for smaller flowering size and flower number in this monocarpic species. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A hybrid origin for xPachydopsis is supported by a chromosome number of 2n = 15, with this comprising haploid gametes from A. thaliana (n = 5) and P. cheesemanii (n = 10). DNA fingerprinting using amplified fragment length polymorphism data also confirmed the parentage of the hybrid, as it comprised the additive total of all of the fragments scored for P. cheesemanii and most of those scored for A. thaliana. xPachydopsis is a robust perennial herb with numerous leafy rosettes and long inflorescences like P. cheesemanii, and floral parts that are intermediate between the parents. xPachydopsis produces sterile pollen. Female function of xPachydopsis is partially normal, with the pollen of A. thaliana and several species of Pachycladon readily germinating on the stigma, and pollen tubes growing down the style and transmission tissue into the ovary. No seed was formed from these pollinations, although one embryo developed but subsequently aborted at the torpedo stage. Colchicine was used to induce polyploid inflorescences, and these were confirmed by the size and density of the stomata and pollen diameter. Flowers from the polyploid inflorescences of xPachydopsis were backcrossed with A. thaliana Landsberg erecta and 11 seeds were produced. Four backcross hybrid plants were raised and two of these had a chromosome number of 2n = 20, consistent with a haploid gamete (n = 15) from polyploid × Pachydopsis being fertilized by a haploid pollen gamete (n = 5) from A. thaliana Landsberg erecta. Polyploid × Pachydopsis flowers backcrossed with P. cheesemanii and crossed with P. novaezelandiae did not produce any seeds. The partially fertile intergeneric hybrid described here between Arabidopsis and Pachycladon is remarkable in that, although the two genera occur in an Arabidopsoid clade, they are separated by a reasonable phylogenetic distance. This relationship suggests that Pachycladon and xPachydopsis have the potential to be employed in the study of evolutionary and ecological processes using the wide array of Arabidopsis resources. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 157, 533-544. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",AFLP; Chromosome number; Fecundity; Flow cytometry; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64549154106

The purpose of this study is to investigate patterns of reproduction within racemes in protandrous Aconitum gymnandrum Maxim., and illuminate potential mechanisms and genetic variation of such patterns. Data from pot experiment on 40 maternal families were collected in field. Anther number, pollen:ovule ratio and seed germination rate increased from bottom to top flowers within racemes, but other traits, such as gynoecium mass, carpel number, sepal galea height and seed production decreased significantly with flowering sequence. Variation in floral sex allocation within racemes in A. gymnandrum fitted entirely the prediction of protandry, which was not a result of architectural effect. Such selected pattern may result from a variety of factors influencing the mating environment, such as pollinator directionality, display size and flower longevity. Decline of female success within racemes in A. gymnandrum also resulted from male-biased allocation selected by variation in the mating environment, not resource competition or pollen limitation. Moreover, there was genetic variation for most reproductive traits and the position effect, as evinced by significant variation among families. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Aconitum gymnandrum; Among-family variation; Floral variation; Inflorescence architecture; Protandry; Resource competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48349117134

The pat-2 parthenocarpic tomato cultivar 'Severianin' was cultured with hydroponics, and the GA biosynthesis inhibitor, uniconazole-P, (E)-(S)-l-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) pent-l-en-3-ol, was added to the culture solution at 0,0.01,0.05, and 0.25 mg'L-1 about two weeks before the first flower anthesis. Stigmata were removed to prevent pollination from half of the plants of each concentration before anthesis, and the other half were tapped by a finger at anthesis for pollination. For pollinated fruits, there were no differences in fruit weight and seed number between the different concentrations of uniconazole-P. A significant positive correlation was observed between seed number and fruit weight in pollinated fruits treated with uniconazole-P that was not observed in the absence of uniconazole-P. There were no significant differences in the germination rate at any concentrations tested compared to the control. Seedlings grown from uniconazole-P-treated plants appeared to develop normally and did not differ from the control. Hence, uniconazole-P treatment of the whole plant was useful for increasing the efficiency of seed production for a parthenocarpic pat-2 cultivar. This was augmented by choosing large fruits at harvest, which contain sufficient amounts of true seeds based on the strong positive correlation between seed number and fruit weight.

With potential to improve plant yield and nutritional quality, carotenoids are targets for metabolic breeding/engineering, particularly in the Poaceae (grass family), which includes the major food crops. Depending on genetic background, maize (Zea mays) endosperm carotenoid content varies, and therefore breeding-enhanced carotenoid levels have been of ongoing interest. The first committed step in the plastid-localized biosynthetic pathway is mediated by the nuclear-encoded phytoene synthase (PSY). The gene family in maize and other grasses contains three paralogs with specialized roles that are not well understood. Maize endosperm carotenoid accumulation requires PSY1 expression. A maize antibody was used to localize PSY1 to amyloplast envelope membranes and to determine PSY1 accumulation in relation to carotenoid accumulation in developing endosperm. To test when and if PSY transcript levels correlated with carotenoid content, advantage was taken of a maize germplasm diversity collection that exhibits genetic and chemical diversity. Total carotenoid content showed statistically significant correlation with endosperm transcript levels at 20 d after pollination for PSY1 but not PSY2 or PSY3. Timing of PSY1 transcript abundance, previously unknown, provides critical information for choosing breeding alleles or properly controlling introduced transgenes. PSY1 was unexpectedly found to have an additional role in photosynthetic tissue, where it was required for carotenogenesis in the dark and for heat stress tolerance. Leaf carotenogenesis was shown to require phytochrome-dependent and phytochrome-independent photoregulation of PSY2 plus nonphotoregulated PSY1 expression. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51549106579

The multilocus genotypes of nine microsatellite loci were determined for 130 adult-trees and 367 seeds collected from 20 seed-trees. Mating system analysis, using mixed-mating model and paternity analysis showed that the studied population is perfectly outcrossed (tm = 1.002), and probably self-incompatible.

The average of pollen flow distance was measured inside of the plot by both paternity (827 ± 429 m) and TwoGener analysis (115-363 m). However, this underestimated pollen dispersal distance, since the detected rate of pollen immigration inside of the plot was high (55%).

To test several hypotheses explaining this variation - different introduction events, somatic mutations and sexual reproduction (through manual pollination) - we used AFLP markers to elucidate the patterns of introduction of V. planifolia.

The patterns of diversification of this cultivated species were also studied and compared with other cultivated (V. tahitensis) and wild (V. pompona and V. bahiana) species. Except for one particular phenotype (' Aiguille '), which may come from sexual reproduction, cultivated accessions exhibit very low levels of genetic diversity. They have evolved by the accumulation of point mutations through vegetative multiplication. The genetic diversity revealed could not explain the phenotypic diversity, which may be related to epigenetics or polyploidy.

We selected 'Maypole' and 'Dolgo' as pollinizers for the cultivar 'Fuji', and investigated the rate of fruit and seeds in 'Fuji' fruits produced by pollen of the pollinizers. We developed a method for tracing pollen flow based on the leaf color of progeny and S-RNase allele of 'Maypole', and on Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) analyses of 'Maypole' and 'Dolgo'. These were powerful tools for determining the distance insects (mainly Osmia cornifrons) carry pollen from the pollinizers to 'Fuji'. Although the fruit set of 'Fuji' apples was not reduced with increasing distance between 'Fuji' apple trees and pollinizers (probably due to pollen flow from other commercial cultivars planted outside the area), the rate of 'Fuji' apple fruit produced by the pollen of the pollinizers decreased with increasing distance. The rate of fruit produced by the pollinizers was 84% and 77% when 'Fuji' was 2.5 m from 'Maypole' and 'Dolgo', respectively, and 71% and 64% when 'Fuji' was 5 m from 'Maypole' and 'Dolgo', respectively, but was reduced to 47% and 39% when 'Fuji' was 10 m from 'Maypole' and 'Dolgo', respectively. However, the spacing could cause reduced fruit size, and require extra fruit thinning for producing large fruits. It could also cause reduction of the yield for increasing the planting area of pollinizers. We recommend that pollinizers should be planted not more than 10 m from 'Fuji'. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Fungal diseases are a great threat of them. Several wild Chinese Vitis species showed high resistance to many fungal diseases. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to assess the potential to incorporate these species in a breeding project for development of the disease-resistant seedless cultivars. Hybridization was conducted using V. vinifera as female parents and the wild Chinese Vitis spp. as male parents. In-ovulo embryo rescue was used to develop hybrid plants from the seedless females. An efficient protocol is reported here for the in vitro embryo rescue and plant development from the cross Emerald Seedless × Beichun. Ovules were excised from immature fruits 7 weeks after pollination (WAP) and cultured in the double-phase ER medium supplemented with 6.0% sucrose and 0.3% activated charcoal (AC). Following 8-12 weeks of culture, embryos were removed from the ovules and transferred onto WPM supplemented with 1.0 ?M 6-benzyladenine (6-BA), 2.0% sucrose and 0.2% AC and solidified with 0.6% agar. After 8 weeks of culture, the embryos germinated and subsequently grew into whole plantlets. With the optimized parameters developed in the present study, about 34.0%, 91.2% and 77.4% of embryo formation, embryo germination and plant development were obtained, respectively. When this protocol was applied to 11 other cross combinations, genotype was found to significantly influence embryo formation, embryo germination and plant development, with different frequencies of hybrid plants successfully obtained in all crosses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that seed yield can be increased by (a) by placing bee shelters closer and (b) cultural practices that increase total flower production. Both these factors increased tripped flowers and thus had a positive effect on yield. In addition, warmer temperatures during the growing season, particularly in the early stages of plant growth is shown to not only increase tripped flowers but also reduce the time when the maximum tripped flowers occur.

Whereas many studies have investigated learning and predator memory in protective mimicry, few studies have considered learning in other mimicry systems. Aggressive mimics are defined as the resemblance of a predatory or parasitic species to another nonthreatening or even attractive species in order to approach and attack prey or to gain other benefits such as pollination or transportation. If signal receivers learn to avoid aggressive mimics and their models or learn to distinguish mimics from their models, then the success of mimics should decline. On coral reefs, juvenile bluestreak cleaner fish (Labroides dimidiatus) are aggressively mimicked by the bluestriped fangblenny (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos). Instead of removing parasites from larger host fish, fangblennies attack reef fish and remove scales and dermal tissue. In this study, the signal receiver (a damselfish) spatially avoided cleaner fish and their associated fangblenny mimics after aggressive interactions; however, avoidance was not exhibited for longer than 24 h. Damselfish did not appear to discriminate between cleaner fish and mimic fangblenny, however, did discriminate between cleaner fish and nonmimic fangblenny. Avoidance learning was more pronounced when the fangblenny was less similar to the cleaner fish in terms of color. Finally, damselfish learnt to preempt attacks within 1 h of contact with fangblennies. This study provides important insights into the role of both spatial and preemptive avoidance learning in aggressive mimicry. © The Author 2008.

However, there is very little evidence regarding the differential effects of climate change on the phenologies of different trophic levels and their potential effects on ecosystem functioning. The Japan Meteorological Agency has monitored the flowering of 4 Prunus tree species and the appearance date of the butterfly Pieris rapae (a proxy for potential pollinators) in spring at Nagano, Japan, since 1953. Flowering tended to occur earlier over the last 3 decades, whereas the appearance of the butterfly was delayed. The effects of climate and the timing of the sensitive period differ between both trophic levels. The plants were strongly affected by temperature (r = -0.87) 30 to 40 d prior to flowering, whereas the butterfly was less affected by temperature (r = -0.50), and the effects mainly occurred during the 15 d prior to its appearance. The temperature during the plants' sensitive period has increased sharply since 1953, whereas the temperature during the butterfly's sensitive period has not changed significantly. The phenologies of the plants and butterfly are changing in opposite directions because they use different climatic cues with different temporal trends. This is the first documentation of differential effects of climate change between plant and insect phenology in Japan. © Inter-Research 2008.",Daily temperature; Flowering; Global warming; Insect appearance; Phenology; Pieris rapae; Prunus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949208326

Pabst ex F. Barros that occurs in a rainforest in south-eastern Brazil. Its non-rewarding flowers, which attract Centridini bees by deceit, are rain-assisted self-pollinated, a phenomenon rarely found in orchids and other plant families. In addition, self-pollination has never been reported in Cyrtopodiinae and data on the pollination of South American orchids are scarce. Flowers were observed at different times of the day, on both sunny and rainy days, to record floral morphology, visitors and the effects of rainfall on flowers. On rainy days, water accumulates on the stigma and dissolves the adhesive substance of the stigmatic surface. A viscous drop thus forms, which contacts the pollinarium. When evaporation makes the viscous drop shrink, the drop moves the pollinarium with the anther onto the stigmatic surface and promotes self-pollination. Fruit set in natural habitat was low, with 2.4% at one study site, where a similar value (2.2%) was recorded in flowers self-pollinated by rain. In C. polyphyllum, facultative self-pollination assisted by rain is thus an important strategy that guarantees fruit set when pollinator's visits are scarce, which is common in species pollinated by deceit. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45249108649

Plants are locally abundant within the 11 discrete populations surveyed, with an estimated population of 611 315 adult plants. Plants are highly restricted to a small area of occupancy, seed dispersal is nearly non-existent and extreme fires appear to have destroyed almost all seeds and seedlings and decimated the pollinators. Of known Macrozamia pollinators, only the thrips, Cycadothrips chadwicki Mound, were found on cones, and these were found in very low numbers. The pollination syndrome for this cycad appears to be unique, based on two cone traits. For one, thermogenesis peaks in early evening, a contrast with daytime peaks of other Cycadothrips-pollinated Macrozamia, but matches that of the Tranes weevil-pollinated Macrozamia machinii. In addition, cone volatiles include both previously unreported compounds as well as those reported exclusively on either Cycadothrips- or Tranes-pollinated species. Based on its small, fragmented area of occupancy, projected population declines and the unique pollination syndrome, we recommend that M. platyrhachis retain its current status as 'Endangered'. Habitat management plans should stipulate that controlled burns be avoided during cycad coning season and that wildfires be controlled to minimise damage to seedlings and pollinators. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45249112346

The following six new species are described: C. anaphalanta (Costa Rica), C. dicranopygia (Costa Rica), C. leptorhamphis (Costa Rica, Panama), C. melanoptera (Venezuela), C. stratiotricha (Costa Rica) and C. trigaea (Costa Rica). The monophyly of Cotithene is supported by the characters of a dorsomedially expanded, carinate rostrum, ventrally angulate head, long and anteriorly directed setation on the anterior margin of the prosternum and an apicodorsally expanded aedeagus with paired sclerites in the male, and subcontiguous to separated procoxal cavities in the female. Particularly the males of several species have intriguing and allometrically scaled modifications on the head (triangular projections, long setae) and pronotum (expansion, tumescences), which possibly play a role in male-to-male conflicts. Cotithene species are specialized to visit and reproduce on a narrow range of typically closely related species of Cyclanthaceae. The adults do not function as pollinators, and the herbivorous larvae develop in the fruiting organs of their hosts, frequently triggering the abortion of infructescences. An analysis of 12 taxa (5 outgroup, 7 ingroup) and 32 morphological characters yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram (L = 38, CI = 89, RI = 93) with the topology (C. dicranopygia, (C. stratiotricha, ((C. leptorhamphis, C. trigaea), (C. globulicollis Voss, (C. anaphalanta, C. melanoptera))))). The evolution of morphological traits and host shifts is examined in light of the proposed phylogeny.

This variability may be a by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to produce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, standing crop and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar production rates were highly variable (CV = 1.48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar standing crops were even more variable (CV = 2.16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar standing crops, increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar standing crops and production rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Geitonogamy; Honeybee; Nectar variability; Pollination; Rosmarinus officinalis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44649090599

Small numbers of progeny (Pa) were indeed recovered after numerous alien pollinations and in-planta development or in-vitro culture. The Pa plants were characterized phenotypically and studied cytogenetically and microscopically to help establish their origin documenting their reproductive basis. Root-tip chromosome counts and meiotic Metaphase-I analyses revealed that chromosome numbers among cells of the Pa plants ranged from 33 to 44 and that the differences in chromosome number among cells of the same plant ranged from 1 to 3, indicating somatic instability. Flow cytometric analysis also indicated the aneuploid nature of Pa plants.

We investigated the number of cones (NCone) per branch basal area (BBA) and the proportion of cones (PCone) in the three crown layers (upper, middle, and lower) for 72 Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. clones in 2004 and 2005. We also measured cone characteristics in each layer to infer their resource or pollen availability. Further, in 2006 we conducted pollination experiments for another 19 P. densiflora ramets, manipulating pollen quality (open-pollinated, self-pollinated (selfed), and polycrossed) in their two crown layers (upper and lower), and examined how pollen quality could affect the among-layer differences. Among 72 clones investigated, PCone in the upper crown layer was significantly greater, with a decrease of the total NCone per BBA; at that time, the seed/ovule ratio (S/O) in the upper crown layer cones was generally greater than that found in the middle and lower crown layers. In the pollination experiments, self-pollination resulted in a decreased S/O in the cones, regardless of the crown layer: S/O in the selfed cones, which were pollinated with controlled-quality pollen, did not differ between the upper and lower layers. Clones with relatively fewer cones allocated more resources to producing cones in the optimal cone-producing layer (upper crown layer) than would be expected from their biomass allocation, suggesting that optimal cone production is the result of a pollination-related factor. © 2008 NRC Canada.",Cone allocation; Cone characteristics; Crown layer; Pinus densiflora; Pollen quality; Seed/ovule ratio (S/O),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749134006

Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator networks (53% of the plant species, 21% of the pollinator species and 4.9% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70% in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30%). We conclude that specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant-pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought. We suggest that this may be due to the opportunistic nature of plant and animal species regarding the available partner resources they depend upon at any particular time. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Apparent vs. real specialization; Coevolution; Ecological networks; Food web structure; Mediterranean scrub; Nestedness analysis; Network analysis; Sampling effort,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43249101636

They were tested by distribution survey in the field, historical survey using literature, and predation experiment using mesh cages. As a result, the factors affecting the distribution among the islands and the timing of observed declines of native pollinators supported the anole predation hypothesis rather than other hypotheses. In addition, result of experimental predation test well explained the composition of flower visitors in the main islands (Chichi-jima and Haha-jima).

We bridged this ""generation gap"" in Ipomopsis aggregata, a long-lived semelparous wildflower that is pollinator limited, by adding varying densities of seeds to natural populations and following resulting plants through their entire life histories. To determine whether pollen limitation of seed production constrains rate of population growth in this species, we sowed seeds into replicated plots at a density that mimics typical pollination success and spacing of flowering plants in nature, and at twice that density to mimic full pollination. Per capita offspring survival, flower production, and contribution to population increase (?) did not decline with sowing density in this experiment, suggesting that typical I. aggregata populations freed from pollen limitation will grow over the short term. In a second experiment we addressed whether density dependence would eventually erase the growth benefits of full pollination, by sowing a 10-fold range of seed densities that falls within extremes estimated for the natural ""seed rain"" that reaches the soil surface. Per capita survival to flowering and age at flowering were again unaffected by sowing density, but offspring size, per capita flower production, and ? declined with density. Such density dependence complicates efforts to predict population dynamics over the longer term, because it changes components of the life history (in this case fecundity) as a population grows. A complete understanding of how constraints on seed production affect long-term population growth will hinge on following offspring fates at least through flowering of the first offspring generation, and doing so for a realistic range of population densities. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Density dependence; Experimental seed augmentation; Ipomopsis aggregate; Life history; Long-term demographic monitoring; Matrix model; Pollen limitation; Population growth; Scarlet gilia; Seed limitation; Survivorship,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849101998

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland. © 2007 The Authors.",Abundance; Bees; Ditch banks; Hover flies; Inflorescences; Pollination; Species density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949142489

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Abundance; Arctic; Constraint; Ecological network; Linkages between species; Mutualistic network; Phenology; Pollination; Preferential attachment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43249130033

Ongoing research seeks to determine the role that introduced honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) play in the pollination of both invasive and native plants. Here we report on the importance of A. mellifera as pollinators of a California native plant, Triteleia laxa Bentham. In observation plots and transect censuses, A. mellifera overwhelmingly dominated the T. laxa flower visitor assemblage. We believe the proximity to agriculture, where A. mellifera density is higher relative to areas far from agriculture, contributes to the discrepancy between A. mellifera abundance at the two sites. Although A. mellifera were inferior flower visitors qualitatively (visited less flowers per minute), they were the most frequent interactors with flowers. Furthermore, the proportion of visits to flowers on the same plant among flower visitor species did not differ, suggesting a general mechanism by which insects forage at T. laxa flowers and that A. mellifera do not cause more deleterious geitonogamy than do native pollinators. Flower visitation rates as a function of floral display size did not differ between A. mellifera and other flower visitors. The difference in the magnitude of flower visitation (largely by A. mellifera) between sites is consistent with a difference in seed set between sites. These results suggest that non-native A. mellifera bees can play an important role in the pollination of native plant species. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.",Apis mellifera; Honey bee; Invasive species; Native plant; Triteleia laxa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46849121174

Attempts to restore damaged ecosystems usually emphasize structural aspects of biodiversity, such as species richness and abundance. An alternative is to emphasize functional aspects, such as patterns of interaction between species. Pollination is a ubiquitous interaction between plants and animals. Patterns in plant-pollinator interactions can be analysed with a food web or complex-systems approach and comparing pollination webs between restored and reference sites can be used to test whether ecological restoration has taken place. 2. Using an ecological network approach, we compared plant-pollinator interactions on four pairs of restored and ancient heathlands 11 and 14 years following initiation of restoration management. We used the network data to test whether visitation by pollinators had been restored and we calculated pollinator importance indices for each insect species on the eight sites. Finally, we compared the robustness of the restored and ancient networks to species loss. 3. Plant and pollinator communities were established successfully on the restored sites. There was little evidence of movement of pollinators from ancient sites onto adjacent restored sites, although paired sites correlated in pollinator species richness in both years. There was little insect species overlap within each heathland between 2001 and 2004. 4. A few widespread insect species dominated the communities and were the main pollinators. The most important pollinators were typically honeybees (Apis mellifera), species of bumblebee (Bombus spp.) and one hoverfly species (Episyrphus balteatus). The interaction networks were significantly less complex on restored heathlands, in terms of connectance values, although in 2004 the low values might reflect the negative relationship between connectance and species richness. Finally, there was a trend of restored networks being more susceptible to perturbation than ancient networks, although this needs to be interpreted with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological networks provide a powerful tool for assessing the outcome of restoration programmes. Our results indicate that heathland restoration does not have to occur immediately adjacent to ancient heathland for functional pollinator communities to be established. Moreover, in terms of restoring pollinator interactions, heathland managers need only be concerned with the most common insect species. Our focus on pollination demonstrates how a key ecological service can serve as a yardstick for judging restoration success. © 2007 The Authors.",Complex system; Ecological restoration; Food web; Heathland; Network; Pollination; Pollination web,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949141234

Here we show that co-flowering aloes in a succulent thicket community in South Africa partition the fauna of flower-visiting birds. Aloe species with small amounts of concentrated nectar in long corolla tubes were pollinated primarily by long-billed sunbirds. These species co-flowered with species with large amounts of dilute nectar in short corolla tubes which were pollinated primarily by short-billed, generalist nectarivores. Aloe species which share pollinators tend to have divergent flowering times and differences in pollen placement on birds.

Evaluation of our ability to predict cross-pollination rates (CPR) at long distance using dispersal functions estimated in experimental set-ups differing by either their scale or their environmental conditions is crucial to establish appropriate management rules following the release of genetically modified (GM) crops. 2. From 1998 to 2004 we measured oilseed rape CPR in commercial fields for 44 donor-recipient couples separated by 220 up to 2000 m, from up to three different pollen donor cultivars in two French oilseed rape production areas. We followed the same sampling and screening designs and tested the effect of region, year, size, cultivar and distance on the observed CPR. 3. We then compared observed CPR to predictions from six empirical pollen dispersal models based on dispersal kernels that were fitted previously at the local and landscape scales. These predictions allowed us to test the possibility to extrapolate and up-scale dispersal kernels. 4. The observed CPR varied from 0% to 0.092%. They were higher in Champagne-Ardennes, where they depended negatively on distance, than in Bourgogne where they did not depend on distance. CPR also differed among years, being nil for the last 3 successive years, partly because of different environmental conditions and detection issues. CPR depended further on the source cultivars due to differences in pollen production. Dispersal kernels fitted at the local scale lead to systematic and huge underestimation of CPR, when observed. The power-law kernel fitted at the landscape scale under-estimated CPR by two orders of magnitude above 400 m but followed the rate of decrease of the observed pollination with distance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Caution should be taken when extrapolating and up-scaling dispersal kernels and models because predictions may differ greatly from observations. Models should rely at least upon dispersal kernels estimated from landscape-scale data obtained in different regions. Models should also integrate several phenomena at the agro-ecosystem scale including the dispersal by insects and become more mechanistic to account for variations observed among years, environments and distance to borders. © 2007 The Authors.",Brassica napus; Cross-pollination rates; Empirical pollen dispersal models; Extrapolations; Herbicide resistant cultivars; Landscape-scale; Up-scaling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949086337

Concern about a global decline in wild pollinators has increased interest in how pollinators are affected by human land use, and how this, in turn, affects crop pollination. 2. We measured wild bee visitation to four summer vegetable crops, and investigated associations between flower visitation rates and land-use intensity at local and landscape scales. We studied 29 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. Over 2 years we recorded >7400 bee visits to crop flowers and identified 54 species of wild bees visiting crops. 3. Wild bees were the dominant flower visitors at three of the four crops studied; domesticated honeybees, Apis mellifera L., provided the remainder of visits. 4. Ordination of the two best studied crops showed that the wild bee species visiting tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., were distinct from those visiting watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai. 5. Crop visitation by wild bees was not associated with organic farming, nor with natural habitat cover at either local or landscape scale. 6. Synthesis and applications. The extent of crop visitation by wild bees observed in this study is among the highest recorded. In contrast to previous studies of crop visitation by wild bees, we did not find negative effects of conventional farming or natural habitat loss. In our study system, organic and conventional farms differ little in field size, crop diversity and weedy flower diversity, unlike some systems where organic farms have smaller fields with greater crop and weed diversity. Such variables may be more important than organic vs. conventional farming practices. Second, small patches of natural habitat are dispersed throughout our entire study system, and this habitat heterogeneity may support high bee abundance even in landscapes with a low proportion of natural habitat overall. Our findings suggest that agri-environment schemes and similar programmes that work through local habitat restoration should target farms in intensively agricultural (homogeneous) landscapes to gain maximum conservation benefits. © 2007 The Authors.",Agroecosystems; Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Crop pollination; Ecosystem services; Forest fragmentation; Landscape mosaic; Organic farming,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848866430

Box 5003 (UR), NO-1432 Ås, Norway","Pollen limitation on a plant community level has received little attention, although it might show which pollination-related traits may cause pollen limitation to vary among species. To address several central questions in plant reproductive biology, we investigated pollen limitation in 11 plant species, including visitation and specialisation levels of all species. The female reproductive success of most species within the studied plant community was not pollen limited, but a general tradeoff between seed production and seed weight occurred as a response to supplemental pollination. In contrast to general notion, we did not find that less visited species were most pollen limited. Instead, it appears that species with high visitation rates were most pollen limited. Our study provided conflicting evidence to whether specialisation levels may affect the degree of pollen limitation within the study community. We discuss these findings in the context of recent reviews on the occurrence, causes and consequences of pollen limitation in plants. In particular, we propose that, although pollen limitation is an important phenomenon, 1) the majority of species within a plant community may not experience pollen limitation at a given moment, 2) that common notions of which plant species should experience pollen limited reproductive success do not hold true in the studied plant community, and 3) that offspring quality is as likely affected by surplus pollen loads as is the number of offspring. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849095192

This taxon undoubtedly belongs to Trib. Vandeae due to its comparatively advanced epiphytic and monopodial characteristics with very hard pollinia and long stipe. It is akin to Ascocentrum and Holcoglossum, from which it differs by its lip lacking appendage, side-lobes arising from both sides of the mid-lobe rather than the entrance to the spur; large stigmatic cave; very large rostellum, conspicuously broader than the column, spreading downward; pollinia each with a distinct caudicle attached to the incurved subterminal portion of a common stipe. Phylogenetic analysis shows that it may be of tropical region originally and evolve into a new genus due to changed environment, indicating that the main motivation of angiosperm differentiation is to bring forth more ecological opportunities. A further examination of reproductive ecology, especially pollination mechanism and breeding system, proved that this species has formed many mechanisms to promote selfing and inbreeding, such as symbiosis with ants (Temnothorax sp.), utilization of ants for short-distant pollination, opening of flowers simultaneously to increase the frequency of geitonogamy, efficient dispersal and growth of seeds, and crowded communities to improve the possibility of inbreeding. All the adaptive changes above turn into necessary conditions for their survival in subtropical regions. The reproductive strategy of this unique life history shows that this immigrant species autonomously passes the genes on to future generations to remain their adaptability, by quickly occupying the habitat. It is a successful strategy in habitat expansion that inflorescence produces a lot of flowers to facilitate geitonogamy, whose significance may extend to provide evidence that the occurrence of plants' sex results from the trade-offs of the fluctuation of habitat in evolution. © 2008 Ecological Society of China.",breeding system; C. singchii; Chenorchis; eco-strategy; evolution; new genus; new species; Orchidaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249113868

To address this, BR levels were manipulated through the application of exogenous BRs (24-epibrassinolide, EBR) or a BR biosynthesis inhibitor (brassinazole, Brz) and their effects on early fruit development, cell division, and expression of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) genes were examined in two cucumber cultivars that differ in parthenocarpic capacity. The application of EBR induced parthenocarpic growth accompanied by active cell division in Jinchun No. 4, a cultivar without parthenocarpic capacity, whereas Brz treatment inhibited fruit set and, subsequently, fruit growth in Jinchun No. 2, a cultivar with natural parthenocarpic capacity, and this inhibitory effect could be rescued by the application of EBR. RT-PCR analysis showed both pollination and EBR induced expression of cell cycle-related genes (CycA, CycB, CycD3;1, CycD3;2, and CDKB) after anthesis. cDNA sequences for CsCycD3;1 and CsCycD3;2 were isolated through PCR amplification. Both CsCycD3;1 and CsCycD3;2 transcripts were up-regulated by EBR treatment and pollination but strongly repressed by Brz treatment. Meanwhile, BR6ox1 and SMT transcripts, two genes involved in BR synthesis, exhibited feedback regulation. These results strongly suggest that BRs play an important role during early fruit development in cucumber. © 2008 The Author(s).",Brassinosteroids; Cell division; Cucumis sativus; Cyclin; Flow cytometry; Parthenocarpy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48649087654

However, for the use of SE in tree breeding programs, the frequency of SE initiation needs to be improved and controlled, and this was investigated in 13 open-pollinated (OP) families over three consecutive years. A diallel mating design with five parent trees was used to study genetic control of SE induction. Results showed that SE induction varies across E. globulus families and over the years of seed production tested. Somatic embryogenesis was initiated on explants from 84% of the OP families tested in 2002 and 100% of the families tested in 2003 and 2004. The year 2003 gave best results for percentage of induction and total number of somatic embryos produced.

We used chemical and behavioral analyses to test whether fragrance has evolved in concert with morphology in these Andean cacti. Floral scent (145 total compounds) was collected using dynamic headspace methods and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing subspecies-specific odors dominated by sesquiterpenes in E. ssp. ancistrophora and arachnacantha and fatty acid derivatives or aromatics in E. ssp. cardenasiana and pojoensis. Compounds indicative of sphingophily were not consistently found in moth-pollinated plants, and total scent emissions were significantly lower in populations with nocturnal anthesis. In wind tunnel assays, Manduca sexta moths were attracted to scent of ssp. ancistrophora from both bee and hawkmoth-pollinated populations, but not to scent of ssp. cardenasiana. However, hawkmoths were most attracted to the methyl benzoate-dominated scent of a distant relative, Echinopsis mirabilis. Thus, hawkmoth-pollinated descendants of the E. ancistrophora lineage may be phylogenetically constrained to emit weak, sesquiterpene-dominated fragrances that are not optimally attractive to hawkmoths, or floral scent may be under stronger selection by destructive flower visitors. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45749152115

Among short-scaped plants, both pollination success, quantified as initiation of fruits and seeds, and seed predation were positively correlated with the relative frequency of the long-scaped morph. The relative strength of these effects and the direction of the resulting frequency-dependent selection on scape morph varied among years and populations.

However, there is also the possibility that anthocyanins are present in some flowers as defensive molecules that protect them from excess light, pathogens, or herbivores. In this study, resistance due to anthocyanins from commercial petunia flowers (Petunia hybrida) was examined for insecticide/antifeedant activity against corn earworm (CEW, Helicoverpa zea) and cabbage looper (CL, Trichoplusia ni). The petunia flowers studied contained a star pattern, with colored and white sectors. CEW larvae ate significantly less colored sectors than white sectors in no-choice bioassays in most cases. All CEW larvae feeding on blue sectors weighed significantly less after 2 days than larvae feeding on white sectors, which was negatively correlated with total anthocyanin levels. CL larvae ate less of blue sectors than white sectors, and blue sectors from one petunia cultivar caused significantly higher CL mortality than white sectors. Partially purified anthocyanin mixtures isolated from petunia flowers, when added to insect diet discs at approximately natural concentrations, reduced both CEW and CL larva weights compared to the controls. These studies demonstrate that the colored sectors of these petunia cultivars slow the development of these lepidopteran larvae and indicate that anthocyanins play some part in flower defense in petunia. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anthocyanins; Insect; Petunia; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849094757

We test the hypothesis that differential selection by two sister species of pollinating yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) drove divergence between two varieties of the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) by comparing measures of differentiation in floral and vegetative features. We show that floral features associated with pollination evolved more rapidly than vegetative features extrinsic to the interaction and that a key floral feature involved in the mutualism is more differentiated than any other and matches equivalent differences in the morphology of the pollinating moths. A phylogenetically based, ancestral states reconstruction shows that differences in moth morphology arose in the time since they first became associated with Joshua trees.

Despite their ecological and economic importance as pollinators, North American bumblebees have not been extensively surveyed and their conservation status is largely unknown. In this study, two approaches were used to determine whether bumblebees in that region were in decline spatially and temporally. First, surveys performed in 2004-2006 in southern Ontario were compared to surveys from 1971 to 1973 in the same sites to look at changes in community composition, in one of the most bumblebee diverse areas of eastern North America. Second, the extent of range decline for a focal species (Bombus affinis Cresson) was estimated by surveying 43 sites throughout its known native range in eastern Canada and the United States. Our study documents an impoverishment of the bumblebee community in southern Ontario over the past 35 years. Bombus affinis in particular was found to have declined drastically in abundance not only in southern Ontario but throughout its native range. The loss of any bumblebee species may result in cascading impacts on native fauna and flora and reduce agricultural production.

Moreover, Oxalis displays tristyly, which is a rare and specialized sexual system that includes a strong self-incompatibility component between three floral morphs to promote out-crossing within populations. As tristyly requires the availability of plants with different floral morphs as well as effective pollinators for seed production, this breeding system can affect small populations when fully expressed. Factors that may have an effect on rarity in Oxalis were investigated by focusing on the expression of tristyly, levels of natural seed production, clonality and the ecology of eight rare/highly localized Oxalis species. Field experiments revealed that the reproductive success of some Oxalis species may be hampered by tristyly, resulting in extremely low levels of natural seed production. Other species display a more relaxed expression of self-incompatibility, which in combination with the possibility of cross-pollinations provides reproductive assurance regardless of population structure and pollinator availability. Others are rare and endangered, but appear not to be negatively affected by the tristylous breeding system.

Based on extrapolation from these small-scale experiments, very substantial monetary values for the pollination service have recently been suggested. However, previous research has not included direct measurement of coffee yield at a farm level in relation to pollinator activity, testing if pollinators are not only limiting fruit set and quality, but also coffee yield and farm profit. The extrapolations from small-scale experiments may be subject to error, because resource reallocation during fruit development, associated with enhanced pollination, was neglected, and many studies were restricted to a single coffee farm, limiting the validity of extrapolation. Here, we investigate the relationship between coffee yield and the community of coffee flower-visiting bees on 21 farms in Ecuador, where coffee is grown under tree shade. Our data show, for the first time on a farm-scale, that coffee yield was positively related to the density of non-managed, social flower-visiting bees per coffee shrub, but not to the number of inflorescences per shrub. Our data revealed that a fourfold increase in bee density was associated with an 80% increase in yield and an 800% increase in net revenues. Consequently, in our study higher yield associated with increased pollination generated higher revenues per hectare, so that farm profit was higher when bees were abundant. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Coffea arabica; Ecosystem service; Farm-wide yield; Honey bee; Pollination; Stingless bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42549166591

All females in the dimethoate treatment died postspray + 1 d. Before death, some of these females behaved similarly to our previous orchard observations. A high proportion of females in the IDB cage were inactive for a few hours before resuming normal foraging and nesting activity. No lethal or behavioral effects were found for any of the other compounds or mixtures tested. Our results indicate that the fungicide applications that we tested are compatible with the use of O. lignaria as an orchard pollinator.",Behavioral effects; Orchard pollination; Side effects; Sublethal dosages,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46849104685

To date there are little firm data on disease propagation in the field via natural root grafts. This question was thus addressed in the present case study by investigating trees of a 24-year old commercial apple orchard ('Red Chief' on MM 111), where the existence of root connections was discovered accidentally. After having displayed specific AP symptoms, nine trees were cut down and the stubs were infiltrated or brushed with glyphosate. Herbicide injury, however, remained not only restricted to the treated stubs, but also spread to approximately 50 neighbouring trees. Surprisingly, none of the pollinators ('Granny Smith' on M 9) growing interjacently and alternating between herbicide-damaged main crop trees was affected. Respective to the position of the nine AP-infected and glyphosate-treated cut stumps, four sections in the orchard were defined, from which a total of 122 trees was sampled and analysed using qualitative real-time PCR for detection of AP phytoplasma. The pathogen was found in 71.4% of 'Red Chief' trees with severe herbicide damage and 18.8% of trees with partial herbicide damage. None of the 31 investigated pollinators was AP-infected. Our data indicate that root connections seem to play a role for the spread of AP phytoplasma at least in older orchards and between trees on vigorous rootstocks. © 2007 KNPV.",'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali'; Glyphosate; Pathogen transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149117657

Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities. 2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons. 3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns. 4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found. 5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees. © 2007 The Authors.",Agro-ecosystems; Apoidea; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Euglossini; Landscape ecology; Meliponini; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949126265

Many anthophilous insects have an innate colour preference that is displayed during their first foraging bouts and which could help them locate their first nectar reward. Nevertheless, learning capabilities allow insects to switch their colour preferences with experience and thus, to track variation in floral nectar availability. Manduca sexta, a crepuscular hawkmoth widely studied as a model system for sensory physiology and behaviour, visits mostly white, night-blooming flowers lacking UV reflectance throughout its range in the Americas. Nevertheless, the spectral sensitivity of the feeding behaviour of naïve moths shows a narrow peak around 450 nm wavelengths, suggesting an innate preference for the colour blue. Under more natural conditions (i.e. broader wavelength reflectance) than in previous studies, we used dual choice experiments with blue- and white-coloured feeders to investigate the innate preference of naïve moths and trained different groups to each colour to evaluate their learning capabilities. We confirmed the innate preference of M. sexta for blue and found that these moths were able to switch colour preferences after training experience. These results unequivocally demonstrate that M. sexta moths innately prefer blue when presented against white flower models and offer novel experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that learning capabilities could be involved in their foraging preferences, including their widely observed attraction to white flowers in nature. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Innate preference; Learning; Lepidoptera; Sensory ecology; Vision,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44149095015

All PpsSFBs showed similar structure characteristics of SFBs from other Prunus species, and matched with the necessary conditions for pollen S-determinant. No mutations leading to dysfunction of S-haplotype were found in their full-length c-DNA sequences, except for PpsS-3?-haplotype which was not amplified by PCR.

The loss of semi-natural grasslands in agro-ecosystems has increased the importance of adequate management of remaining grasslands. Recommendations for intensive grazing have been debated because the effects of different management practices may differ between taxa and species. The increased fragmentation of grasslands suggests that the influence of management practices should be studied in a landscape context. 2. We studied four groups of flower visitors, many of which are pollinators, bees (Apoidea), butterflies (Lepidoptera), hoverflies (Syrphidae) and beetles (Coleoptera), in semi-natural grasslands managed at three intensity levels in eight areas in central Sweden. Local characteristics of the grasslands were recorded and landscape diversity was quantified. Vegetation height was correlated with grazing intensity: intensive grazing with the shortest vegetation and abandoned grassland with the tallest. 3. The insect groups responded differently to grazing intensity. Species richness and abundance differed between management regimes for beetles and hoverflies but not for bees and butterflies. 4. The effects of local habitat and landscape composition on species richness, abundance and composition differed between groups. Bee diversity responded to both local and landscape factors. Butterflies were mainly affected by local vegetation height and linear elements in the landscape. More species of hoverflies were recorded in tall vegetation and in landscapes with high forest cover. Beetles responded only to local environment characteristics. 5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the importance of studying different insect groups simultaneously when evaluating habitat and landscape qualities for diversity. The results suggest that planning for conservation of biodiversity at landscape scales may be better than implementing grazing guidelines for individual grasslands. Grazing intensity should vary within or between landscapes to preserve pollinator diversity. Conservation management to encourage flower visitors cannot be generalized to include all groups simultaneously. © 2008 The Authors.",Abundance; Composition; Diversity; Grassland; Management; Semi-natural; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949131557

These deceptive plants should benefit from flowering in close proximity to such rewarding plants, because pollinators are locally conditioned on floral signals of the rewarding plants (mimic effect) and because pollinators are more abundant close to rewarding plants (magnet effect). We tested these ideas using the non-rewarding South African plant Eulophia zeyheriana (Orchidaceae) as a study system. Field observations revealed that E. zeyheriana is pollinated solely by solitary bees belonging to a single species of Lipotriches (Halictidae) that appears to be closely associated with the flowers of Wahlenbergia cuspidata (Campanulaceae), a rewarding plant with which the orchid is often sympatric. The pale blue color of the flowers of E. zeyheriana differs strongly from flowers of its congeners, but is very similar to that of flowers of W. cuspidata. Analysis of spectral reflectance patterns using a bee vision model showed that bees are unlikely to be able to distinguish the two species in terms of flower color. A UV-absorbing sunscreen was applied to the flowers of the orchid in order to alter their color, and this resulted in a significant decline in pollinator visits, thus indicating the importance of flower color for attraction of Lipotriches bees. Pollination success in the orchid was strongly affected by proximity to patches of W. cuspidata. This was evident from one of two surveys of natural populations of the orchid, as well as experiments in which we translocated inflorescences of the orchid either into patches of W. cuspidata or 40 m outside such patches. Flower color and location of E. zeyheriana plants relative to rewarding magnet patches are therefore key components of the exploitation by this orchid of the relationship between W. cuspidata and Lipotriches bee pollinators. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Batesian mimicry; Bee vision; Eulophia zeyheriana; Facilitation; Lipotriches; Magnet species; Orchidaceae; Pollination success; UV; Wahlenbergia cuspidata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54149096137

Honey bees are beneficial insects for natural and cultivated ecosystems through pollination. The goal of the present study was to assess potential effects of two concentrations of Cry1Ab protein (3 and 5000 ppb) on young adult honey bees. Following a complementary bioassay, our experiments evaluated effects of the Cry1Ab on three major life traits of young adult honey bees: (a) survival of honey bees during sub-chronic exposure to Cry1Ab, (b) feeding behaviour, and (c) learning performance at the time that honey bees become foragers. The latter effect was tested using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) procedure. The same effects were also tested using a chemical pesticide, imidacloprid, as positive reference. The tested concentrations of Cry1Ab protein did not cause lethal effects on honey bees. However, honey bee feeding behaviour was affected when exposed to the highest concentration of Cry1Ab protein, with honey bees taking longer to imbibe the contaminated syrup. Moreover, honey bees exposed to 5000 ppb of Cry1Ab had disturbed learning performances. Honey bees continued to respond to a conditioned odour even in the absence of a food reward. Our results show that transgenic crops expressing Cry1Ab protein at 5000 ppb may affect food consumption or learning processes and thereby may impact honey bee foraging efficiency. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of risks of transgenic Bt crops for honey bees. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In the nursery pollination system of figs (Ficus, Moraceae), flower-bearing receptacles called syconia breed pollinating wasps and are units of both pollination and seed dispersal. Pollinators and mammalian seed dispersers are attracted to syconia by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In monoecious figs, syconia produce both wasps and seeds, while in (gyno)dioecious figs, male (gall) fig trees produce wasps and female (seed) fig trees produce seeds. 2. VOCs were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption methods on freshly collected figs from different trees using Super Q® collection traps. VOC profiles were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 3. The VOC profile of receptive and dispersal phase figs were clearly different only in the dioecious mammal-dispersed Ficus hispida but not in dioecious bird-dispersed F. exasperata and monoecious bird-dispersed F. tsjahela. 4. The VOC profile of dispersal phase female figs was clearly different from that of male figs only in F. hispida but not in F. exasperata, as predicted from the phenology of syconium production which only in F. hispida overlaps between male and female trees. Greater difference in VOC profile in F. hispida might ensure preferential removal of seed figs by dispersal agents when gall figs are simultaneously available. 5. The VOC profile of only mammal-dispersed female figs of F. hispida had high levels of fatty acid derivatives such as amyl-acetates and 2-heptanone, while monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and shikimic acid derivatives were predominant in the other syconial types. A bird- and mammal-repellent compound methyl anthranilate occurred only in gall figs of both dioecious species, as expected, since gall figs containing wasp pollinators should not be consumed by dispersal agents. © 2008 The Authors.",Bird-dispersed figs; Chemical ecology; Floral volatiles; Frugivory; Fruit volatiles; Mammal-dispersed figs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949085400

Here, the role of density for the mating system of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), a wind-pollinated annual colonizing species previously reported as self-compatible, is explored. • Methods: The effect of population density on the proportion of self- and cross-fertilized seeds was examined using allozyme markers and experimental arrays conducted over two seasons in the field. Also the reproductive success of isolated plants located in diverse habitats was measured. The potential occurrence of a physiological mechanism preventing self-fertilization, i.e. self- incompatibility, following controlled self- and cross-pollinations in the glasshouse was examined. • Key Results: Outcrossing rates estimated using allozyme markers were uniformly high, regardless of the spacing between plants. However, when single plants were isolated from congeners they set few seeds. Observations of pollen-tube growth and seed set following controlled pollinations demonstrated that plants of A. artemisiifolia possess a strong self-incompatibility mechanism, contrary to earlier reports and assumptions. • Conclusions: The maintenance of high outcrossing rates in colonizing populations of A. artemisiifolia is likely to be facilitated by the prodigious production of wind-borne pollen, high seed production and extended seed dormancy. © The Author 2008.

Native perennial plants with different bloom periods can provide floral resources for bees throughout the growing season for use in pollinator conservation projects. To identify the most suitable plants for this use, we examined the relative attractiveness to wild and managed bees of 43 eastern U.S. native perennial plants, grown in a common garden setting. Floral characteristics were evaluated for their ability to predict bee abundance and taxa richness. Of the wild bees collected, the most common species (62%) was Bombus impatiens Cresson. Five other wild bee species were present between 3 and 6% of the total: Lasioglossum admirandum (Sandhouse), Hylaeus affirm (Smith), Agapostemon virescens (F.), Halictus ligatus Say, and Ceratina calcarata/dupla Robertson/Say. The remaining wild bee species were present at <2% of the total. Abundance of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) was nearly identical to that of B. impatiens. All plant species were visited at least once by wild bees; 9 were highly attractive, and 20 were moderately attractive. Honey bees visited 24 of the 43 plant species at least once. Floral area was the only measured factor accounting for variation in abundance and richness of wild bees but did not explain variation in honey bee abundance.

The flowers of Impatiens capensis (jewelweed) possess a long, curved spur in which nectar is produced and stored. Spur length and curvature varies among plants within one population. Here I document that spur shape is variable in natural populations, variation within plants is less than variation among plants, and spur shape is correlated with components of female and male reproductive success. The apparent natural selection is weakly directional in 1 of 2 years, with greatest seed production and pollen removal occurring in flowers with the greatest spur curvature. Bee pollinator visit length is longest at flowers with highly curved spurs, and they leave less nectar in these spurs than in flowers with straighter spurs. Spur angle evolution may be limited, at least in part, by opposing selection by nectar-robbers who prefer to visit flowers with greater spur curvature. Other factors that might contribute to the maintenance of spur angle variation are temporal variation in the strength of selection and potential genetic correlations of spur shape with other traits under selection. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Jewelweed; Natural selection; Spur angle; Spur curvature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43349108622

From 2003 to 2005, we observed 68 species of plants visited by birds in an Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil, including three canopy species: Spirotheca rivieri (Malvaceae, Bombacoidea), Schwartzia brasiliensis (Marcgraviaceae), and Psittacanthus dichrous (Loranthaceae). Flowers of these three species were visited by 15 different species of perching birds and by hummingbirds. The flowers of these three plants are colorful, ranging from deep red or purple to orange. Spirotheca rivieri blooms during the austral winter and Schwartzia brasiliensis during the summer. The flowers of these two species produce copious amounts of dilute nectar in easily accessible structures and both species appear to depend primarily on perching birds as pollinators, with hummingbirds being secondary or minor pollen vectors. The tubular, narrow flowers of P. dichrous are produced during the austral summer and are visited primarily by hummingbirds. Perching birds also visit the flowers, but destroy them.

Male insects fooled into gripping or copulating with orchids unwittingly transfer the pollinia.

Insects pollinating Australian tongue orchids (Cryptostylis species) frequently ejaculate and waste copious sperm. The costs of sperm wastage could select for pollinator avoidance of orchids, thereby driving and maintaining sexual deception via antagonistic coevolution or an arms race between pollinator learning and escalating orchid mimicry. However, we also show that orchid species provoking such extreme pollinator behavior have the highest pollination success. How can deception persist, given the costs to pollinators?

For example, are aliens concentrated in niches under-exploited by native communities, or widely distributed across the ecological spectrum? To explore this question, we compared the niches occupied by 394 naturalized alien plants with a representative sample from the native flora of Mediterranean islands. When niche structure was described by a functional group categorization, the distribution of native and alien species was remarkably similar, although ""succulent shrubs"" and ""trees with specialized animal pollination mechanisms"" were under-represented in the native species pool. When niche structure was described by Grime's CSR strategy, the positioning of aliens and natives differed more strongly. Stress-tolerance was much rarer amongst the aliens, and a competitive strategy was more prevalent at the habitat level. This pattern is similar to previous findings in temperate Europe, although in those regions it closely reflects patterns of native diversity. Stressed environments are much more dominant in the Mediterranean. We discuss a number of factors which may contribute to this difference, e.g., competitive and ruderal niches are often associated with anthropogenic habitats, and their high invasibility may be due partly to introduction patterns rather than to a greater efficiency of aliens at exploiting them. Thus far, the reasons for invasion success amongst introduced species have proved difficult to unravel. Despite some differences, our evidence suggests that alien species naturalize across a wide range of niches. Given that their ecologies therefore vary greatly, one may ask why such species should be expected to share predictable traits at all? © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biological invasions; Functional ecological groups; Grime's CSR strategic triangle; Homogenous urban environments; Natural and semi-natural habitats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44049093754

Ecologically, they are indicators of ground water and keystone species providing fruit for frugivores. Their pollination is highly specialized, the pollinating wasps having co-evolved with the host Ficus species. The study was conducted in Buganda where some species are integrated in the coffee/banana agriculture as shade trees, and a source of bark cloth or 'olubugo', a cultural Baganda cloth. Nine districts were surveyed covering fourteen forest and five savannah reserves, 22 farmlands and pastoral areas. Methods used were transect/quadrat, belt transects, total counts and opportunistic sampling. Altogether 32 out of the 44 species known from Uganda were recorded. The majority were epiphytic forest species, six obligate epiphytes were absent in cultivation where the most terrestrial species were recorded. Epiphytes showed no host preference, but grew on the largest or most common trees. Mean densities were the highest in drier forests and wetter savanna/cultivation and species richness indices followed the rainfall gradient. Only some forests had fairly stable populations. Species present in cultivation were sometimes absent in adjacent vegetation, and all those that survived in cultivation and savanna had known uses. © 2008 The Authors.",Ficus; Growth habit; Habitats; Pollination; Populations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41949091318

This study investigates whether some traits that are under pollinator-mediated selection (flower number, stalk height, corolla diameter, corolla tube length and corolla tube width) in the Mediterranean herb E. mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae) are associated with rewards (pollen and nectar). • Methods: During 2005 the phenotypic traits and the visitation rate of the main pollinator functional groups were quantified in 720 plants belonging to eight populations in south-east Spain, and during 2006 the same phenotypic traits and the reward production were quantified in 400 additional plants from the same populations. • Key Results: A significant correlation was found between nectar production rate and corolla tube length, and between pollen production and corolla diameter. Visitation rates of large bees and butterflies were significantly higher in plants exhibiting larger flowers with longer corolla tubes. • Conclusions: The association between reward production and floral traits may be a factor underlying the pattern of visitation rate displayed by some pollinators. © The Author 2008.

The results showed that about 53% of varieties among 32 tested genotypes were male sterile. Not only did the pollen vitalities in normal varieties show distinct differences, but pollen vitalities from flower forcing in a glasshouse were found to be lower than those from natural flowering in the field, which had no apparent effect on fruit setting of tested varieties. Most of the tested genotypes such as Nanguoli, Pingxiangli, and Hanxiangli showed selfincompatibility (SI). Honghuagaili could bear fruit after hand pollination, but there were abnormal seeds in its fruits. So we suggested it was a recessive SI that happened during embryo development. Longxiangli has the capacity of self-compatibility (SC) to some extent, its fruit setting rate of inflorescence could reach 23.3%. Manual self-pollination during bud flowering could improve the fruit setting rate of part tested genotypes with SI, but had no effect on the fruit setting rate 3 days after flowering. Mating between female parents with the variety selected from F1 generation showed that the majority of their combinations were compatible. There was one-way SC when Nanguoli was crossed with Hanhongli, while no fruits could be found after Hanhongli was crossed with Nanguoli. It may be related to the S-genotype or haplotype of Nanguoli. In addition, mating between the varieties derived from bud mutation with the female parent appeared incompatible. We concluded that P. ussuriensis Maxim. is similar to other grown pear systems with the characteristics of SI, the fruit setting rate of self pollination in some varieties and wild types can be improved by artificial self-pollination during bud flowering, and fruit cannot be developed through pollination between the varieties from bud mutation and the female parent. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",Mating compatibility; Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim.; Self-incompatibility (SI); Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44449170461

In maize, CKs are thought to play an important role in establishing seed size and increasing seed set under normal and unfavorable environmental conditions therefore influencing yield. In recent years, the discovery of isopentenyl transferase (IPT) genes in plants has shed light on the CK biosynthesis pathway in plants. In an effort to increase our understanding of the role played by CKs in maize development and sink-strength, we identified several putative IPT genes using a bioinformatics approach. We focused our attention on one gene in particular, ZmIPT2, because of its strong expression in developing kernels. The expression of the gene and its product overlays the change in CK levels in developing kernels suggesting a major role in CK biosynthesis for kernel development. We demonstrate that at 8-10 days after pollination (DAP) the endosperm and especially the basal transfer cell layer (BETL) is a major site of ZmIPT2 expression, and that this expression persists in the BETL and the developing embryo into later kernel development stages. We show that ectopic expression of ZmIPT2 in calli and in planta created phenotypes consistent with CK overproduction. We also show that ZmIPT2 preferentially uses ADP and ATP over AMP as the substrates for dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) IPT activity. The expression pattern of ZmIPT2 in the BETL, endosperm and embryo during kernel development will be discussed with an emphasis on the suggested role of CKs in determining sink-strength and grain production in crop plants. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cytokinin biosynthesis; Isopentenyl transferase; Maize; ZmIPT2,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42649141944

Within the temperate bumble bee (Bombus spp.) fauna, members of the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto are amongst the most abundant and widespread. However, their species diversity is controversial due to the extreme difficulty or inability morphologically to identify the majority of individuals to species. Our character-based phylogenetic analyses of partial CO1 (700 bp) from 39 individuals spread across their sympatric European ranges provided unequivocal support for five taxa (3-22 diagnostic DNA base pair sites per species). Inclusion of 20 Irish specimens to the dataset revealed ?2.3% sequence divergence between taxa and ?1.3% within taxa. We developed a PCR-RFLP based method for unequivocally distinguishing amongst the four cryptic European taxa of this subgenus, B. cryptarum, B. lucorum, B. magnus and B. terrestris, and used it to analyse 391 females of the former three species collected across Ireland, all of which could be unambiguously assigned to species. Bombus lucorum was the most widely distributed and abundant of the cryptarum-lucorum-magnus species complex, comprising 56% of individuals, though it was significantly less abundant at higher altitudes (>200 m) whilst B. cryptarum was relatively more abundant at higher altitudes. Bombus magnus was rarely encountered at urban sites. Both B. lucorum and B. terrestris are nowadays reared commercially for pollination and transported globally. Our RFLP approach to identify native fauna can underpin ecological studies of these important cryptic species as well as the impact of commercial bumble bees on them. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bombus; CO1; Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1; DNA barcode; PCR-RFLP,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42549097410

We also made progress toward developing reliable methodology for testing pesticides on wild bees for use in pesticide registration by using field and laboratory experiments. Bee larvae were exposed to control, low (3 or 6 ppb), intermediate (30 ppb), or high (300 ppb) doses of either imidacloprid or clothianidin in pollen. Field experiments on both bee species involved injecting the pollen provisions with the corresponding pesticide. Only O. lignaria was used for the laboratory experiments, which entailed both injecting the bee's own pollen provisions and replacing the pollen provision with a preblended pollen mixture containing imidacloprid. Larval development, emergence, weight, and mortality were monitored and analyzed. There were no lethal effects found for either imidacloprid or clothianidin on O. lignaria and M. rotundata. Minor sublethal effects were detected on larval development for O. lignaria, with greater developmental time at the intermediate (30 ppb) and high doses (300 ppb) of imidacloprid. No similar sublethal effects were found with clothianidin on M. rotundata. We were successful in creating methodology for pesticide testing on O. lignaria and M. rotundata; however, these methods can be improved upon to create a more robust test. We also identified several parameters and developmental stages for observing sublethal effects.

This attraction is primarily mediated by floral odor, which offers potential for developing generic insect attractants based on odor. In this study, we have analyzed the chemical composition of the volatiles produced by Canada thistle flowers. Nineteen floral compounds were identified in the headspace, including phenylacetaldehyde (55%), methyl salicylate (14%), dimethyl salicylate (8%), pyranoid linalool oxide (4.5%), and benzaldehyde (3.5%). Other minor compounds include benzyl alcohol, methylbenzoate, linalool, phenylethyl alcohol, furanoid linalool oxide, p-anisaldehyde, 2,6-dimethyl-1,3,5,7-octatetraene, benzylacetate, benzyl tiglate, (E,E)-?-farnesene, benzyl benzoate, isopropyl myristate, and 2-phenylethyl ester benzoic acid. The relative attractiveness of various doses of the main floral volatile compound phenylacetaldehyde (i.e., 10, 100, 200, and 400 mg) was tested for insect attraction. Both the total catch and the biodiversity of insect species trapped increased as the loading of phenylacetaldehyde increased. Volatiles were chosen from the odors from the flowers of Canada thistle and formulated and tested in the field. An 11-component blend was the most attractive of several floral blends tested. These findings indicate that chemical components of flower odors of Canada thistle can serve as a generic insect attractant for monitoring of invasive pest species. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.",Canada thistle; Cirsium arvense; Floral volatiles; Invasive species; Kairomone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46849083701

Bumblebees provide an important pollination service to both crops and wild plants. Many species have declined in the UK, particularly in arable regions. While bumblebee forage requirements have been widely studied, there has been less consideration of whether availability of nesting sites is limiting. It is important to know which habitats contain the most bumblebee nests per unit area in order to guide conservation and management options; particularly in the light of current emphasis on environmental stewardship schemes for farmed landscapes. However, it is extremely difficult to map the distribution of bumblebee nests. 2. We describe the findings of the National Bumblebee Nest Survey, a structured survey carried out by 719 volunteers in the UK during early summer 2004. The surveyors used a defined protocol to record the presence or absence of bumblebee nests in prescribed areas of gardens, short grassland, long grassland and woodland, and along woodland edge, hedgerows and fence lines. The records allowed us to estimate the density of bumblebee nests in each of these habitats for the first time. 3. Nest densities were high in gardens (36 nests ha-1), and linear countryside habitats (fence lines, hedgerows, woodland edge: 20-37 nests ha-1), and lower in non-linear countryside habitats (woodland and grassland: 11-15 nests ha-1). 4. Findings on nest location characteristics corroborate those of an earlier survey carried out in the UK (Fussell &amp; Corbet 1992). 5. Synthesis and applications. Gardens provide an important nesting habitat for bumblebees in the UK. In the countryside, the area occupied by linear features is small compared with that of non-linear features. However, as linear features contain high densities of nests, management options affecting such features may have a disproportionately large effect on bumblebee nesting opportunities. Current farm stewardship schemes in the UK are therefore likely to facilitate bumblebee nesting, because they provide clear guidance and support for 'sympathetic' hedgerow and field margin management. © 2007 The Authors.",Bombus; Environmental stewardship schemes; Gardens; Nesting habitat; Voluntary survey,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849105294

Genotype dependence for microspore totipotency was observed and a significant effect of genotype by bud size selection was established. The addition of activated charcoal in NLN medium containing 13% (w/v) sucrose and 10 ?M silver nitrate resulted in a fourfold increase in microspore embryogenesis, ranging from 100 to 405 embryos per Petri dish corresponding to 2,700-10,935 embryos per 100 buds. Conversion/germination of embryos produced in presence or absence of activated charcoal was similar but air-drying of microspore embryos was essential. Incubation of microspore embryos at 4 ± 1°C for 10 days in dark resulted in 82.3% conversion. The majority of plants produced from these embryos was haploid. Treating microspore-derived plants at the 3-4 leaf growth stage with 0.34% colchicine for 2-3 h resulted in greatest survival (70%) and chromosome doubling (75%) frequencies.

Individual seedlings of the morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea L. Roth, however, have been shown to exhibit tolerance to glyphosate, surviving after what should have been a lethal dose. Those that grow and reach reproductive maturity often exhibit deformed anthers within what appear to be normally developed flowers. Ipomoea purpurea has a mixed mating system and normally has hermaphroditic flowers that are capable of both selfing and outcrossing. The deformed anthers do not produce pollen, essentially converting a hermaphroditic flower to a female. Here we describe this morphological change and investigate the reproductive consequences of anther deformation. First, there is phenotypic variation for the propensity of an individual to exhibit male sterility through deformed anthers in response to treatment, but a series of field and greenhouse studies suggest that this variation is not genetic. The male sterility is also transient; within an individual, the frequency of flowers with deformed anthers declines over time. Although flowers with deformed anthers do not produce pollen, we observed mixed effects on female function of such flowers. In the greenhouse, flowers with deformed anthers that were hand-pollinated produced as many seeds as flowers with normal anthers, suggesting no effect on female fertility. In the field, however, plants with a higher proportion of anther deformation set significantly fewer seeds than those untreated, suggesting either reduced female fertility, or a reproductive penalty in flowers with deformed anthers due to the inability to self pollinate. Thus, the presence of this trait could alter the selfing to outcrossing ratio in populations that are sprayed with the herbicide. Individuals that exhibited a higher proportion of anther deformation also produce fewer total flowers than untreated plants, suggesting that anther deformation is part of a suite of responses to damage by glyphosate. © 2008 NRC.",Anther; Glyphosate; Male sterility; Pollen; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749094724

The initiation, magnitude and timing of those peaks are strongly modulated by ambient temperature; the period between successive thermogenic temperature peaks is not circadian, and light is neither necessary nor sufficient to initiate a thermogenic event.

Consistently higher injury levels were observed in the two species of Idarnes than in the pollinator species. The results suggested that aggressive confrontations were involved in the mating strategies of Idarnes, whereas non-aggressive strategies were shown by males of P. tonduzi. Generally, injury variables in Idarnes spp. correlated positively with the male encounter rate and negatively with the fig size, thus supporting the contest competition theory.

The molecular relationships found in this study differ from those defined by traditional systematic morphological assessments. By comparing the variation in sequence to variations in floral traits, we propose that the split in the two main lineages reflects an early differentiation of flower size, perhaps due to the shift from allo- to self-pollination. Conversely, the relationships within each minor group do not reflect floral size variation; therefore, we presume that this diversification resulted from genetic drift, local selection forces, and multiple, independent transitions towards self-pollination and polyploidy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The promoter regions of these genes were isolated, and transcriptional promoter:?-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs were stably transformed into rice and barley. The GUS expression patterns revealed that these promoters were active in early grain development in both rice and barley, and showed strongest expression in endosperm transfer cells during the early stages of grain filling. The GUS expression was similar in both rice and barley, but, in barley, expression was exclusively in the endosperm transfer cells and differed in timing of activation relative to rice. In rice, both promoters showed activity not only in the endosperm transfer cells, but also in the transfer cells of maternal tissue and in several floral tissues shortly before pollination. The expression patterns of OsPR602 and OsPR9a in flowers differed. The similarity of expression in both rice and barley suggests that these promoters may be useful to control transgene expression in the transfer cells of cereal grains with the aim of altering nutrient uptake or enhancing the barrier against pathogens at the boundary between maternal tissue and the developing endosperm.

A systematic study was undertaken to determine the best seed treatments and germination conditions for muscadine seed. Open-pollinated seeds of 'Fry' muscadine were used for all treatments. Stratification of seeds was performed by placing dry seed in damp vermiculite at 4°C for periods of 0, 30, 60, and 90 d. The 90-d stratification period gave the highest germination percentage, with successively lower germination in the shorter stratification treatments. Pretreatment of seeds before stratification with three rates (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 M) of hydrogen peroxide (H2O 2) and four rates (1, 2, 4, and 8 g·L-1) of gibberellic acid (GA3) were used in an attempt to promote germination. Low rates of H2O2 (0.5 M) and GA3 (1 g·L-1) were beneficial in some instances, whereas high rates of GA3 were detrimental. Nicking the seedcoats before stratification and soaking seeds in running water after stratification were ineffective in promoting germination.

Genetic variation at six microsatellite loci was used to quantify genetic structure in the insect-pollinated, animal-dispersed, low-density tree Sorbus torminalis L. Crantz, and to derive historical estimates of gene flow. The neighbourhood size and root-mean-squared dispersal distance inferred from seedling genotypes (Nb = 70 individuals, ?e = 417 m) were similar to those inferred from adult genotypes (Nb = 114 individuals, ?e = 472 m). We also used parentage analyses and a neighbourhood model approach after an evaluation of the statistical properties of this method on simulated data. From our data, we estimated even contributions of seed- and pollen-mediated dispersal to the genetic composition of established seedlings, with both fat-tailed pollen and seed dispersal kernels, and slightly higher mean distance of pollen dispersal (248 m) as compared to seed dispersal (135 m). The resulting contemporary estimate of gene dispersal distance (?c = 211 m) was ?twofold smaller than the historical estimates. Besides different assumptions and statistical nuances of both approaches, this discrepancy is likely to reflect a recent restriction in the scale of gene flow which requires manager's attention in a context of increasing forest fragmentation. © 2008 The Authors.",Isolation by distance; Neighbourhood model; Parentage analyses; Sorbus torminalis L.

Many bee species show narrow host-plant preferences, reflected both in behavioral and morphological adaptations to particular attributes of host-plant pollen or floral morphology. Whether bee host-plant associations reflect co-cladogenesis of bees and their host plants or host-switches to unrelated host plants is not clear. Rophitinae is a basal subfamily of Halictidae in which most species show narrow host-plant preferences (oligolecty). We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the rophitine genera using a combination of adult morphology (24 characters) and DNA sequence data (EF-1?, LW rhodopsin, wingless; 2700 bp total). The data set was analyzed by parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. All methods yielded highly congruent results. Using the phylogeny, we investigated the pattern of host-plant association as well as the historical biogeography of Rophitinae. Our biogeographical analysis suggests a number of dispersal/vicariance events: (1) a basal split between North America and South America (most likely a dispersal from South America to North America), and (2) at least two subsequent interchanges between North America and Eurasia (presumably via the northern hemisphere land bridges). Our analysis of host-plant associations indicates that Rophitinae specialized on a closely related group of angiosperm orders in the Euasterid I clade (mainly Gentianales, Lamiales and Solanales). However, there is little evidence of cocladogenesis between bees and plants and strong evidence of host switches to unrelated host plants. Based on our phylogenetic results we describe two new tribes of Rophitinae: Conanthalictini new tribe (including the genus Conanthalictus) and Xeralictini new tribe (including Xeralictus and Protodufourea). © The Willi Hennig Society 2007.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43549091381

The results showed that IAA and GA3 stimulated in vitro pollen tube growth, ABA inhibited pollen tube growth, and ZT had no significant effect on the process. The stimulating effect of exogenous IAA was particularly distinct, and led to synchronous growth of straighter and more slender pollen tubes compared with the controls. However, no significant changes were found in the germination of the treated pollen. The auxin efflux inhibitor, 10 ?M 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), was also found to stimulate pollen tube growth. We measured the content of hormones (free IAA, ZT, GA3, and ABA) in the stigmas and styles before and after pollination. The hormone contents of stigmas measured 0.5 h after pollination (0.5 HAP) showed that ABA content decreased, whereas the content of IAA, ZT, or GA3 did not change significantly. The hormone level in pollinated styles (4 HAP) when pollen tubes had grown into the middle part of style was characterized by an increase in free IAA and GA3 and a decrease in ABA, which was in agreement with the results that IAA and GA3 promoted but ABA inhibited pollen tube growth in vitro. Furthermore, the change of IAA level in styles was most notable, which was accordant to the fact that auxin stimulated significantly pollen tube growth in vitro. Using immunoenzyme and immunogold labeling techniques and an anti-IAA monoclonal antibody, we confirmed that free IAA was present throughout style tissues, and distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of style cells. All these results suggested that hormones, especially IAA, play important roles in pollen tube growth of T. fournieri. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",ELISA; Hormone; Immunoenzyme; Immunogold; Pollen tube growth; Torenia fournieri L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149096258

Examples of such interactions include the effects of predators and parasites on the evolution of host sexual selection, the effects of parasites and predators on the evolution of virulence, and the effects of parasites and predators on the evolution of pollinator mutualisms. Such interactions among interactions will generally prevent simple cases of coevolution, because any single case of interaction between two parties may be affected by an entire range of additional interacting factors.

Nursery culling aided by sex-specific DNA markers was envisaged to alleviate the unnecessary cost incurred by farmers for maintaining unproductive mate plants that contribute to 40-50% of the population. The mechanism of sex determination in papaya has been described as a tri-allelic single gene system with alleles, M1-dominant for maleness, M2-dominant for hermaphrodism and m-recessive for femaleness with diploid zygotes; M1M1, M2M2 and M1M2 being inviable.

Twenty of most promising of these were analyzed among individual sex types. Two sex-specific fragments, OPC09-1.7 and OPE03-0.4 were associated with maleness and hermaphrodism.

To determine how invasive alien plants affect insect diversity, we compared flying insects captured using Malaise traps among different vegetation types on a small island (Nishijima; 0.49 km2) in the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in the north-western Pacific. The numbers of individuals and species, and the species composition of pollinators (bees), predators (wasps) and wood borers (cerambycid, mordellid and elaterid beetles) were compared among three vegetation types: Casuarina equisetifolia (an invasive alien tree) forest, natural forest and natural grassland (forest edge), during two seasons (June and October-November 2005). In traps, 80.0, 66.7, 87.5, 85.7 and 100.0% of bee, wasp, cerambycid, mordellid and elaterid beetle species, respectively, were endemic to the Ogasawara Islands. Grassland had the highest wasp and bee species richness, whereas natural forest had the highest species richness of wood-boring beetles. The C. equisetifolia forest had the poorest species richness for most insect groups (except mordellid beetles). More individuals of most insect groups (except bees) were captured in June than in October-November. More individual bees and wasps were captured in grassland than in forests, whereas more individual mordellid and elaterid beetles were captured in forests than in grassland. The number of cerambycid individuals did not differ among vegetation types. Redundancy analysis suggested that most insect species preferred natural forest or grassland to alien forest. Therefore, further invasion of natural grassland and forest by the alien tree C. equisetifolia may negatively affect the endemic insect fauna of Nishijima. © 2008 The Entomological Society of Japan.",Bee; Cerambycidae; Elateridae; Invasive alien tree; Mordellidae; Wasp,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47249098971

The analysis is based upon choice experiments with 202 German arable farmers. A multinomial probit estimation reveals that GM attributes such as gross margin, expected liability from cross pollination, or flexibility in returning to conventional oilseed rape significantly affect the likelihood of adoption. Neighbouring farmers' attitudes towards GM cropping and a number of farmer and farm characteristics were also found to be significant determinants of prospective adoption. Demand simulations suggest that adoption rates are very sensitive to the profit difference between GM and non-GM rape varieties. A monopolistic seed price would substantially reduce demand for the new technology. A monopolistic seed supplier would reap between 45% and 80% of the GM rent, and the deadweight loss of the monopoly would range between 15% and 30% of that rent. The remaining rent for farmers may be too small to outweigh possible producer price discounts resulting from the costs of segregating GM and non-GM oilseed rape along the supply chain. © 2008 The Author.

Given the increasing commercial cultivation of GM crops in the European Union (EU), there is an urgent need to define measures to prevent mixing of GM with non-GM products during crop production. Cross-fertilization is one of the various mechanisms that could lead to GM-inputs into non-GM crop systems. Isolation distances between GM and non-GM fields are widely accepted to be an effective measure to reduce these inputs. However, the question of adequate isolation distances between GM and non-GM maize is still subject of controversy both amongst scientists and regulators. As several European countries have proposed largely differing isolation distances for maize ranging from 25 to 800 m, there is a need for scientific criteria when using cross-fertilization data of maize to define isolation distances between GM and non-GM maize. We have reviewed existing cross-fertilization studies in maize, established relevant criteria for the evaluation of these studies and applied these criteria to define science-based isolation distances. To keep GM-inputs in the final product well below the 0.9% threshold defined by the EU, isolation distances of 20 m for silage and 50 m for grain maize, respectively, are proposed. An evaluation using statistical data on maize acreage and an aerial photographs assessment of a typical agricultural landscape by means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) showed that spatial resources would allow applying the defined isolation distances for the cultivation of GM maize in the majority of the cases under actual Swiss agricultural conditions. The here developed approach, using defined criteria to consider the agricultural context of maize cultivation, may be of assistance for the analysis of cross-fertilization data in other countries. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bt-maize; Coexistence; Cross-fertilization; Genetically modified crops; GIS; Pollen-mediated gene flow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42549105497

We examined the function of the pollen presenter and its efficiency in pollen dispersal, female fitness, and the degree of interference created by self-pollen in the shrublet Polygala vayredae, an insect-pollinated species with secondary pollen presentation. Herkogamy, a mechanism generally involved in the reduction of self-interference, was also evaluated. Significant pollen was lost (49% of total pollen) during the secondary relocation in the pollen presenter. However, pollen was exported from the pollen presenter, and subsequent pollen losses were similar to those in species with primary pollen presentation. Despite the presence of a self-incompatibility system, the numbers of developed pollen tubes as well as fruit and seed production were significantly reduced by the self-pollen interference created at the stigmatic papillae level. The extent of herkogamy correlated positively with female fitness. The secondary pollen presentation mechanism may in fact be an accurate system for pollen transport, but it may also have its costs.

This flower polymorphism has been regarded as a strategy to reduce the likelihood of self- and intramorph pollination and to promote legitimate intermorph pollination. Although most distylous plants are characterized by a physiological self- and intramorph-incompatibility system, previous work on Pulmonaria affinis and other distylous Boraginaceae species have shown that self-incompatibility was not strict. In this study, we examined pollen deposition rates and the functioning of the distylous breeding system in Pulmonaria officinalis. Flowers exhibited reciprocal herkogamy and several other ancillary features of heterostyly. Controlled pollinations clearly showed weak self-incompatibility, with the LS-morph showing higher rates of seed set following self-, intramorph- and intermorph-pollinations than the SS-individuals. On the other hand, SS-pollen showed higher germination rates and pollen tube growth than that of LS-pollen. Under natural conditions, both the proficiency of legitimate pollen transfer and the proportion of deposited pollen were asymmetrical. Although SS-pollen grains showed a higher proficiency for legitimate transfer than that of LS-pollen on a per pollen basis, the ratio of legitimate to illegitimate deposited pollen on stigmas of SS-flowers markedly exceeded that of LS-flowers. The latter was explained by the higher pollen production rates of LS-individuals compared to SS-individuals. High levels of illegitimate pollen deposition on LS-stigmas, on the other hand, were attributed to the limited proboscis length of the principal pollinators and the occurrence of floral hairs at the corolla entrance of LS-flowers. This study thus indicates asymmetrical pollen transport patterns and morph-specific differences in the strength of the incompatibility system; two aspects that may affect female reproductive success and morph ratio variation under pollen limited conditions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Anthophora plumipes; Bombus; Disassortative mating; Heterostyly; Pollen deposition; Pollen tube growth; Reciprocal herkogamy; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42249107459

Dispersal may also occur between taxa that would normally be isolated when nonendemic, domesticated or transgenic species are planted within the natural range of interfertile taxa. Such a mosaic of populations is typical of many agricultural landscapes, and investigations are needed to assess the risks of genetic contamination of the endemic populations but a combination of approaches may be necessary because of the limitations of research in this landscape. This study used microsatellite markers and a range of analyses (mating system, paternity exclusion, Bayesian assignment) to examine gene dispersal between remnants of the endemic Eucalyptus loxophleba ssp. supralaevis and a plantation of a nonendemic subspecies. Our results indicate that remnant populations are connected by significant dispersal to pollen sources up to 1.94 km away including the plantation. The combined analyses showed that the pollen pool and outcrossing rates of individuals within remnants varied significantly probably because of asynchronous flowering and that the likelihood of paternity was not correlated with spatial proximity. More than half of all progeny had male parents from outside their stand with the largest proportions estimated to come from the plantation by exclusion (42.4%) or Bayesian analyses (18.8-76%).

In this study, ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated for the rare dioecious tree, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, and the patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in an ex situ conserved population. A combination of microsatellite markers with high-collective exclusion power (0.932) was used to assign paternity to 240 seeds collected from eight maternal trees. The average effective pollen dispersal distance (?) was 292.6 m and the frequency distribution of pollen movement suggested extensive pollen movement in the population. The effective pollen donors per maternal tree (N ep) ranged from 5 to 10, and the most isolated maternal trees were observed with the largest number of N ep = 10. Although a trend of near-neighbor mating was found in seven of eight maternal trees, no significant correlations were detected between the average effective pollen dispersal distance (?) and the geographic distances (d1 and d2) between maternal and male trees.

However, the temporal dynamics of human activities is also likely to influence visitation rates. In this study, I analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of nectar feeding by a population of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) on a public garden of Aloe arborescens plants located on a recreational area along the coast of Mar del Plata City (Argentina). During the weekends there was an increase in vehicle and pedestrian traffic and a decrease in the number of visits by the House Sparrows to A. arborescens. Spatially, the number of visits by House Sparrows on A. arborescens was positively correlated with the number of inflorescences during both weekend days and working days, but during weekend days also was correlated negatively with the distance between plants.

A. concolor is known from ?220 plants, with the largest population found in southern central Victoria and the remaining smaller populations ?100 km north. Some taxonomic uncertainty surrounds the affiliations of these disjunct populations. A. pilotensis is known from ?100 plants in a single location near the Beechworth region of north-eastern Victoria. Small populations such as these can show extreme demographic and/or genetic constraints and careful management is required to ensure their long-term persistence. The present study used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to describe the levels of relatedness among plants from both species and to determine levels of genetic diversity for each species as well as levels of differentiation among A. concolor populations, to assist with species management. Species-level genetic diversity was lower in A. pilotensis (PLP 44%, Hj 0.182) than A. concolor (PLP 58.2%, Hj 0.202). Genetic diversity also varied among A. concolor populations but this does not appear to relate to population size. High levels of inbreeding were evident in A. concolor (f, 0.828) in contrast to moderate levels observed in A. pilotensis (f, 0.466). Genetic relatedness maps, generated by principal coordinates analyses, indicated significant differentiation among A. concolor populations with some sub-structuring also apparent within A. pilotensis. Management implications for the two species, with respect to sourcing of material for translocation and augmentation of pollination events within populations, are discussed in light of these findings. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44249124585

Climate change is particularly pronounced in the High Arctic and a better understanding of the repercussions on ecological processes like herbivory, predation and pollination is needed. Arthropods play an important role in the high-arctic ecosystem and this role is determined by their density and activity. However, density and activity may be sensitive to separate components of climate. Earlier emergence due to advanced timing of snowmelt following climate change may expose adult arthropods to unchanged temperatures but higher levels of radiation. The capture rate of arthropods in passive open traps like pitfall trap integrates density and activity and, therefore, serves as a proxy of the magnitude of such arthropod-related ecological processes. We used arthropod pitfall trapping data and weather data from 10 seasons in high-arctic Greenland to identify climatic effects on the activity pattern of nine arthropod taxa. Results. We were able to statistically separate the variation in capture rates into a non-linear component of capture date (density) and a linear component of weather (activity). The non-linear proxy of density always accounted for more of the variation than the linear component of weather. After accounting for the seasonal phenological development, the most important weather variable influencing the capture rate of flying arthropods was temperature, while surface-dwelling species were principally influenced by solar radiation. Conclusion. Consistent with previous findings, air temperature best explained variation in the activity level of flying insects. An advancement of the phenology in this group due to earlier snowmelt will make individuals appear earlier in the season, but parallel temperature increases could mean that individuals are exposed to similar temperatures. Hence, the effect of climatic changes on the activity pattern in this group may be unchanged. In contrast, we found that solar radiation is a better proxy of activity levels than air temperature in surface-dwelling arthropods. An advancement of the phenology may expose surface-dwelling arthropods to higher levels of solar radiation, which suggest that their locomotory performance is enhanced and their contribution to ecological processes is increased.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949110291

The bees collected on the Island and the immediately adjacent mainland represent six families, 41 genera, and 232 species. About 20% (47 species) are parasitic and do not collect pollen. Most bees are generalist (polylectic) foragers, but there are a few species that appear to visit only a few species or genera of plants (oligolectic foragers). Three exotic species are among the fauna, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). Based on historical specimens in the collection of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM), and contemporary survey efforts, the number of bee species on the Island appears to have increased since the 1920s-1960s, and there is no evidence of local species extinction. It is possible that the use of Malaise and pan traps in addition to hand nets have increased collecting efficiency so that the increase in species richness is an artifact of collecting techniques rather than a biological phenomenon. Alternatively, increased species richness may reflect the resiliency of bees and an increase in available nesting sites as heavily shaded forests of the eastern United States have become open through deforestation and urbanization. While the vegetation of the Island has matured through natural succession, the surrounding Washington, D.C. metropolitan area has seen major urban, industrial, and infrastructure development and the resultant opening of forests, increasing bee habitat.

Most remarkable are those species that employ chemical deceit for the attraction of pollinators [2]. The orchid Epipactis helleborine is a typical wasp flower, exhibiting physiological and morphological adaptations for the attraction of pollinating social wasps [3]. As noted by Darwin [1], this species is almost entirely overlooked by other potential pollinators, despite a large nectar reward. Therefore, the mechanism for the attraction of pollinating social wasps was something of a mystery. By using a combination of behavioral experiments, electrophysiological investigations, and chemical analyses, we demonstrate for the first time that the flowers of E. helleborine and E. purpurata emit green-leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are attractive to foragers of the social wasps Vespula germanica and V. vulgaris. GLVs, emitted by damaged plant tissues, are known to guide parasitic wasps to their hosts [4]. Several E. helleborine GLVs that induced response in the antennae of wasps were also emitted by cabbage leaves infested with caterpillars (Pieris brassicae), which are common prey items for wasps [5]. This is the first example in which GLVs have been implicated in chemical mimicry for the attraction of pollinating insects. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The range of fluctuations in many generative characters is enormous (from 0 to +?), and the distribution of their values is usually skewed, with low values being recorded several times more frequently than high values. Most variable are the proportion of abortive cones and other characters that are determined mainly in the spring of the pollination year.

However, not all of these species can be readily crossed with cultivated potato due to pre- and post-zygotic barriers. Post-zygotic barrier on Solanum spp. is attributed to their difference in endosperm balance number (EBN). According to the EBN successful crosses need to have a 2:1 ratio of maternal to paternal EBN in hybrid endosperm. Thus, only parents with the same EBN can be crossed. The cultivated potato is 4EBN, while wild allotetraploid relatives such as S. stoloniferum are 2EBN. In this study, meiosis and crossability of an exceptional tetraploid 3EBN hybrid obtained from our previous research by crossing S. stoloniferum × S. tuberosum with 2 and 4EBN testers were studied. Although the exact chromosome pairing analysis was not possible, the formation of several polyvalents in each meiocyte suggests that recombination could occur between different genomes. Meiosis had many irregularities such as unequal segregation as well as having laggard chromosome and micronuclei. Crosses involving the interspecific hybrid, as the male parent with 2 and 4EBN testers were not successful, some of which were apparently due to the pollen-pistil incompatibility. Interestingly controlled self-pollination resulted in viable seeds. Crosses of the interspecific hybrid as pistillate parent in the absence of pre-zygotic barrier in most case were successful. Results of the study confirmed the segregation of EBN value in the gametes of hybrid. It was expected that backcross progeny of this hybrid would be a good source for selecting aneutetraploids. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the relationship between seed set and the origin of pollen, either self or cross, and the effects of stigmatic sprays of calcium nitrate, boric acid and polyphenols on seed set. In a screen-house experiment, seed set was analyzed for three predetermined regions in the sunflower capitulum: distal, median and proximal. Cross-pollination combined with calcium nitrate or boric acid spray significantly improved seed set in the distal region compared with cross-pollination alone or with cross-pollination combined with self-pollination. Neither spray had a significant effect on seed set in the median or proximal regions. Cross-pollination of the proximal region only, with either fresh pollen or 24-h-old pollen, did not improve seed set compared with cross-pollination of the whole capitulum. We found no direct link between pollen germination on the stigma and seed set. However, each region of the capitulum responded differently to self- or cross-pollination. In two open-field experiments, stigmatic applications of calcium nitrate significantly increased seed set by approximately 9% compared with open pollination alone, while stigmatic applications of polyphenols significantly increased seed set by approximately 9% only once, suggesting that commercial yields may be increased by using similar applications. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

[Schneider]) is a wind-pollinated perennial shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. In recent years commercial plantations in Arizona and Catamarca, Argentina have dramatically decreased in size and number, going from 13,000 ha in the early 1980s to about 2,300 ha today. The main reason for this decrease is yields being lower than expected, with low pollination percentages considered the main source of the problem, although use of inferior genetic material has contributed to the problem. Artificial or supplemental pollination has been used successfully in other crops to increase yields, and it was thought that this could also be used for jojoba. A trial was carried out over two seasons in which pollen collected in Arizona, was mechanically applied to commercial fields in Catamarca. The first year yields were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the fields in which pollen had been applied, than in the controls. The second year yields were not measured. Rather the number of capsules with fruit, aborts, and empty capsules were counted on a number of randomly selected branches. This technique gives a good estimate of yield, and the results showed that pollen application significantly (P < 0.05) increased expected yields. In conclusion, application of supplemental pollen increases jojoba yields and hence should be considered a viable option for commercial plantations. Additional work is required, however, to determine the correct application rate so as to minimize collection costs, and determine when application should take place to optimize efficacy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Both the shape of the pollination kernel and the spatial distribution of trees affect the distribution of pollen grains and the genotypes they harbour, but little is known about the relative contribution of each of these two factors. Using genetic markers we build a spatial network of pollination events between any two trees in a population of Prunus mahaleb, an insect-pollinated plant. Then, we apply tools from the science of complex networks to characterize the structure of such a mating network. Although the distribution of the number of pollen donors per tree is quite homogeneous, the identity of donors is distributed heterogeneously across the population. This results in a population structured in well-defined modules or compartments, formed by a group of mother trees and their shared pollen donors. Long-distance pollination events decrease the modular structure by favouring mating among all available mates. This increases gene flow across the entire population, reducing its genetic structure, and potentially decreasing the role of genetic drift. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Complex networks; Dispersal kernel; Gene flow; Mating system; Pollination; Prunus mahaleb; Spatial networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41849134288

We used phylogeographical analyses of the pollinating seed parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) to define the historical processes that may have structured interactions of this species with its host plants across major biogeographical breaks in western North America. Using 648 bp of cytochrome oxidase I and amplified fragment length polymorphisims, we identified deep genetic breaks among some populations consistent with some definitions of cryptic species. A combination of phylogenetic and population genetic approaches indicates that different historical processes may have structured G. politella genetic diversity in four regions: northern Pacific Northwest, southern Oregon, southern Sierra Nevada, and the remainder of California. The northern Pacific Northwest had high genetic diversity likely due to glacial refugia and subsequent spatial expansion, concordant with some other taxa. Populations in southern Oregon possessed unique, closely related haplotypes with restricted gene flow, possibly indicating a long-standing set of populations in this endemic-rich region. Analyses of California populations showed evidence of restricted gene flow and spatial expansion with many closely related haplotypes that occupy a broad geographical range. Southern Sierra Nevada populations were genetically distinct and highly diverse, possibly due to a localized glacial refugium. Together, these results suggest that vicariance and population expansion, possibly in combination with geographically variable selection, have shaped the diversification of G. politella and its interactions with its host plants. © 2008 The Authors.",Cryptic species; Gene flow; Geographical mosaic; Glacial refugia; Phylogeography; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049101663

Many species are monomorphic and present stigmas either above or below the anthers, ""approach"" or ""reverse"" herkogamy, respectively. Although numerous studies have examined species that are polymorphic for approach and reverse herkogamy, species with continuous variation in sex organ position have received little attention. We examined continuous variation in anther position, style length, herkogamy, and flower shape in the self-sterile perennial herb Polemonium brandegei. We observed pollinators, measured flower shape and sex organ position in the field, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations among floral traits in the greenhouse. The two major pollinators were hummingbirds Selasphorus platycercus and hawkmoths Hyles lineata and Hyles gallii, which are believed to select for exserted and recessed sex organs, respectively. Herkogamy was not polymorphic but rather ranged continuously from reverse to approach, independent of corolla shape, size, and age. Corolla tube length and width, sex organ heights, and herkogamy were all heritable. Genetic variation for the spatial separation of stigmas and anthers was particularly high (h2 = 0:851; CVa = 36:88; CVa is the coefficient of additive genetic variation).

We have developed a parameter, Functional specialization index, to quantify functional specialization in pollination networks. Using this parameter, we examined whether different sized hummingbirds visit a distinct set of flowers in five hummingbird-pollinated plant assemblages from the Lesser Antilles, obtaining a simple relationship between hummingbird body size, network parameter and ecological function. In the Lesser Antilles, functionally specialized hummingbird pollination is distinct for plant species pollinated by the largest hummingbird species, whereas the pollination niche gradually integrates with the insect pollinator community as hummingbird body size decreases. The network approach applied in this study can be used to validate functional specialization and community-level interdependence between plants and pollinators, and it is therefore useful for evaluating and predicting plant resilience to pollinator loss, presently a global concern. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949175037

Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively, conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we synthesize the results of 23 studies - representing 16 crops on five continents - to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi-natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply, dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat, compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set - variables that directly affect yields - is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions, and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity, and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Agriculture; Bees; Ecosystem services; Habitat fragmentation; Hierarchical Bayesian model; Land use; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41849135030

Alien invasive plants possessing attractive flowers can affect the interactions between native plants and their pollinators. The few studies conducted so far have reported positive, negative and neutral effects of the presence of an invasive species on the pollinator visitation rates and seed output of native species. However, the role played by the density of the alien species has been seldom explored. 2. While high densities of the invasive species can negatively effect the pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the native species, due to sequestration of pollinators by the invasive species, at lower densities the invasive can attract pollinators that otherwise would not visit patches of native species, positively affecting their reproduction. 3. Using observations and pollinator exclusions at a site at 2800 m altitude in the central Chilean Andes, we show that the alien herb Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae), possessing showy floral capitula, shares pollinators to a high degree (> 90%) with two co-occurring native Asteraceae: Hypochaeris thrincioides and Perezia carthamoides. Pollinator exclusion indicated that both natives are highly dependent on insect visitation to produce seeds. 4. Using manipulative supplemental hand-pollination and experiments, where we varied the density of T. officinale, we determined that seed output in H. thrincioides and P. carthamoides is pollen-limited and that its magnitude is not affected by the presence of the exotic. Further, while the presence of one individual of T. officinale around focal native individuals showed neutral or facilitative effects on pollinator service or seed output in the two native species, the presence of five individuals of T. officinale negatively affected these reproductive variables. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the effects of the presence of alien invasive plant species with attractive flowers vary with their density. This demonstrates the need to experimentally test for the potential impacts of introduced species at different densities before prematurely coming to conclusions regarding their assumed negative or positive effects in native ecosystems. © 2008 The Authors.",Competition for pollination; Facilitation; High-alpine ecosystems; Invasive species; Plant reproductive output; Pollen limitation; Pollinator-plant interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149122908

Here, a Monte Carlo simulation study and a result from mathematical statistics on the variance of the product of two random variables are used to estimate the mean and confidence limits of pollinator importance for three visitor species of the wildflower, Silene caroliniana. Both methods provided similar estimates of mean pollinator importance and its interval if the sample size of the visitation and effectiveness datasets were comparatively large. These approaches allowed us to determine that bumblebee importance was significantly greater than clearwing hawkmoth, which was significantly greater than beefly. The methods could be used to statistically quantify temporal and spatial variation in pollinator importance of particular visitor species. The approaches may be extended for estimating the variance of more than two random variables. However, unless the distribution function of the resulting statistic is known, the simulation approach is preferable for calculating the parameter's confidence limits. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Floral generalization; Floral specialization; Pollinator effectiveness; Pollinator visitation; Variance of product,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049151045

It was observed that unpollinated flowers of Cymbidium pendulum (Roxb.) Sw. remained fresh for 20 days and senesced within 8 days after pollination (DAP), while that of Cymbidium aloifolium (L.) Sw. took 18 days when unpollinated but showed senescence in 7 DAP. A higher level of electrolyte leakage was recorded in all the floral organs of pollinated flowers in both the species. There was a concomitant increase in levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); indicators of oxidative damage, in all the organs for both the species. Ascorbic acid, on the other hand, decreased significantly. Higher amount of electrolyte leakage, MDA and H2O2 content were recorded in C. pendulum as compared of the other species while the ascorbic acid, on the other hand, was observed to be decreased and this decrease was more in C. pendulum than C. aloifolium suggesting a higher oxidative damage to the floral organs in the former species than the latter.

In Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, SW China), Ficus curtipes is passively pollinated by an undescribed Eupristina species (Agaonidae). Two species of non-agaonid fig wasps, Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp., also enter the fig to oviposit. Yet such wasps do not establish a mutualistic relationship with figs similar to that of agaonids. Why? Method: Using controlled experiments in which only one foundress per species was introduced to a fig, we compared the effect of the three wasp species on pollination. We recorded foundress distribution in the fig female floral phase, and counted the number of wasps and seeds in the male floral phase. Results: Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp. follow Eupristina sp. into the figs, and both non-agaonids are efficient pollinators. In nature, most figs were entered by just one species of foundress: 36% were entered by Eupristina sp. only, 8% by D. yangi only, and 3% by Lipothymus sp. only. About 28% of adult fig wasps emerging from figs were D. yangi, 4% were Lipothymus sp., and 65% were Eupristina sp.; ten other non-agaonids ovipositing from outside the fig comprised just 3% of the adult wasps that emerged from figs. Both species of fig-entering non-agaonid wasps significantly reduced the number of Eupristina sp. emerging from mature figs but had no effect on seed production. If D. yangi or Lipothymus sp. was introduced to figs containing one foundress of Eupristina sp., both non-agaonid wasps produced offspring. But without the Eupristina, D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. failed to reproduce. Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp. depend on the agaonid, Eupristina, to make galls. Conclusion: Because they depend on the legitimate pollinator to make galls, neither D. yangi nor Lipothymus sp. is able to replace the agaonid wasp and establish a mutualistic relationship with their host fig.",Ficus; Mutualism; Non-pollinating fig wasps; Parasitism; Pollinating fig wasp,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47549090132

Fruits were collected from two sites in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The majority of ovules within fruits were aborted early in development. Emergent patterns of ovule abortion and seed maturation within fruits were nonrandom and dependent on ovule position. The probability of seed maturation within individual fruits decreased significantly from basal to distal ends, suggesting an intrafruit resource gradient. Self-pollinated flowers at one site produced fruits with a similar pattern of seed maturation as was found for open-pollinated plants. However, crosspollinated flowers produced fruits in which the pattern of seed maturation was reversed; more seeds were matured at the distal ends rather than the basal ends of fruits, indicative of a fertilization gradient. Analysis of pollen-tube growth showed that ovule failure may not be attributed to pollen limitation. For seeds produced via hand-pollinations, we found no relationship between seed mass and seedling biomass, although seeds from self-pollinations germinated more readily than did seeds from cross-pollinations.

Nectar supplementation resulted in significant increases in the proportion of flowers pollinated, regardless of morph colour and the density of plants supplemented in the population. However, nectar supplementation had a significant positive effect on pollinaria removal only for the yellow morph in one experiment in which a low proportion of plants were supplemented. Thus a mutation for nectar production would have a positive effect on overall pollination success in D. sambucina, particularly the female component.

Habitat fragmentation might change driving forces of population dynamics by reducing the area of resource-providing habitats, disrupting habitat connectivity, and affecting natural enemies more than their host species. We studied spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002. Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of independent time series showed on average a negative impact of population size on population growth rates but provides no support for top-down regulation by natural enemies. We conclude that population dynamics of O. rufa are mainly driven by bottom-up forces, primarily nest site availability. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Habitat fragmentation; Orchard meadows; Osmia rufa; Pollinators; Population ecology; Red mason bee; Resource limitation; Solitary bees; Time series; Top-down or bottom-up control,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749141310

The mechanisms that prevent competition (conflict) between the recipient and co-operative actor in co-operative systems remain one of the greatest problems for evolutionary biology. Previous hypotheses suggest that self-restraint, dispersal or spatial constraints can prevent direct competition for local resources or any other common resources, thereby maintaining stable co-operation interactions. In this study, we use the obligate fig-fig-wasp mutualism to examine whether the above mechanisms can maintain stable co-operation sufficiently between figs and fig wasps. 2. Our data on obligate co-operation between figs (Ficus racemosa Linn.) and fig wasps (Ceratoslen fusciceps Mayr) show that the number of viable seeds of figs is positively correlated with the number of pollinator offspring when the number of vacant female flowers is high while the foundress number is low (two foundresses). Meanwhile, they are negatively correlated when the number of vacant female flowers is low and the number of foundresses is increased manually (eight foundresses). The correlation coefficient between viable seeds and wasp offspring (galls) depends on vacant female flower availability. 3. Our data suggest that the interaction between figs and fig wasps is conditional, and that they co-operate when local resource availability is plentiful but are in conflict when local resource availability is limited. The self-restraint, dispersal and spatial heterogeneity previously hypothesized in maintaining stable co-operation cannot sufficiently prevent the symbionts from utilizing more local resources at the expense of the recipients. The conflict, which can disrupt the co-operation interaction, exists after the local resource is saturated with symbionts. The repression of symbiont increase, therefore repressing the utilization of local resources in the conflict period, is crucial in the maintenance and evolution of co-operation. © 2008 The Authors.",Co-operation; Conflict; Fig; Mutualism; Repression; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149177921

This plant-animal system is characterized by complex changes in plant chemistry and plant morphology which in turn lead to differences in feeding strategies of future consumers. I postulate that the willow Salix phylicifolia has developed a two-level strategy which results in two different types of twigs (new annual shoots) after moose browsing in winter. This strategy enables the plant to protect reproductive organs by offering two chemically different twigs to herbivores, with catkins concentrated on the less preferred twigs. In addition, it may enable plants to grow out of the reach of browsers. New growth of browsed and unbrowsed twigs on the same individual willow differed in morphology and chemical composition (intraindividual response). New growth from browsed twigs had lower concentrations of individual phenolics, a higher biomass (twigs and leaves), and lower concentrations of nitrogen in leaves than the new growth of unbrowsed twigs. This response resulted in a positive feedback loop for moose, which typically rebrowsed the new growth of browsed twigs, whereas the new growth of unbrowsed twigs was avoided. This feeding behavior was consistent for leaf stripping by moose in summer and pruning of twigs in winter. I found no differences in the feeding behavior of herbivorous insects on the leaves growing on the new annual shoots of either browsed or unbrowsed twigs. The new growth of unbrowsed twigs, which were protected by different specific phenolics, had more catkins than the new growth of browsed twigs. In an interindividual comparison, the number of catkins on browsed willows was reduced. Hence, browsing has an impact on willow reproduction and pollinators. Consequently, large herbivores such as moose are likely to be a driving force in shaping patterns of plant response and plant and consumer communities. © 2008 by the Ecological Socity of America.",Alces alecs; Catkins; Feeding behavior; Herbivory; Insects; Intra-individual plant response; Moose; Phenolics; Pollinators; Salix phylicifolia; Secondary plant chemistry; Willow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849299076

In the genus Acer, previous work suggests that dioecy evolved from heterodichogamy through an initial spread of unisexual males. Here, the question is asked as to whether the different morphs in Acer opalus, a species in which males co-exist with heterodichogamous hermaphrodites, differ in various components of male in fitness. • Methods: Several components of male fertility were analysed. Pollination rates in the male phase were recorded across one flowering period. Pollen viability was compared among morphs through hand pollinations both with pollen from a single sexual morph and also simulating a situation of pollen competition; in the latter experiment, paternity was assessed with microsatellite markers. It was also determined whether effects of genetic relatedness between pollen donors and recipients could influence the siring success. Finally, paternal effects occurring beyond the fertilization process were tested for by measuring the height reached by seedlings with different sires over three consecutive growing seasons. • Key Results: The males and protandrous morphs had higher pollination rates than the protogynous morph, and the seedlings they sired grew taller. No differences in male fertility were found between males and protandrous individuals. Departures from random mating due to effects of genetic relatedness among sires and pollen recipients were also ruled out. • Conclusions: Males and protandrous individuals are probably better sires than protogynous individuals, as shown by the higher pollination rates and the differential growth of the seedlings sired by these morphs. In contrast, the fertility of males was not higher than the male fertility of the protandrous morph. While the appearance of males in sexually specialized heterodichogamous populations is possible, even in the absence of a fitness advantage, it is not clear that males can be maintained at an evolutionary equilibrium with two classes of heterodichogamous hermaphrodites. © The Author 2008.

As semelparous plants have only one chance to reproduce, they are expected to develop effective strategies to prevent reproductive failure. The reproductive strategies of S. kunthianus were investigated by studying the floral traits, pollination biology, and breeding system that are critical for reproductive success. The species exhibits a series of floral traits: (1) gregarious flowering attracts a large number of Apis cerana indica, the major pollinator; (2) the stigma is sensitive to touch by the pollinator; in fresh flowers, the receptive surface faces the entry path of the incoming bee, facilitating pollen deposition; as an immediate response, the stigma curves backwards moving the receptive surface away from the path of the exiting bee, thus preventing autogamy and interference in pollen transfer; (3) flowers remain fresh for 2 days with receptive stigma and nectar and pollen reward. These traits render the species 100% pollination efficient to ensure a high seed set. As the species is self-compatible, the prevailing high degree of geitonogamous pollinations does not interfere with fruit set. The evolution of the adaptive floral traits has facilitated mast seeding in the species. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Apis cerana indica; Breeding system; Monocarpic; Pollination efficiency; Sensitive stigma,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049105758

Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. © 2008 Tylianakis et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-45149118682

We examined this hypothesis using white-flowered variants of the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea. Previous experiments indicate that the white-flowered a allele has a transmission advantage because of increased selfing and no detectable pollen discounting. We confirm this transmission advantage using a large field experiment in which both selfing rate and outcross success were measured for all three genotypes at the A locus. We also demonstrate that this transmission advantage is opposed by apparent pleiotropic effects in aa individuals manifested as reduced survival from germination to flowering. The magnitude of this effect, in combination with the known magnitude of inbreeding depression, more than compensates for the transmission advantage. Our results thus support the notion that deleterious pleiotropy may influence the evolutionary trajectory of flower-color mutants. © 2008 The Author(s).",Anthocyanins; Flower color; Ipomoea; Loss-of-function; Pleiotropy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049145882

The supply of a resource and a consumer's density response to it may in turn yield context-dependent use of other resources. Such consumer-resource interactions occur not only for predator-prey and competitive interactions, but for mutualistic ones as well. For example, consumer-resource interactions between ants and extrafloral nectar (EFN) plants are often mutualistic, as EFN resources attract and reward ants which protect plants from herbivory. Yet, ants also commonly exploit floral resources, leading to antagonistic consumer-resource interactions by disrupting pollination and plant reproduction. EFN resources associated with mutualistic ant-plant interactions may also mediate antagonistic ant-flower interactions through the aggregative density response of ants on plants, which could either exacerbate ant-flower interactions or alternatively satiate and distract ants from floral resources. In this study, we examined how EFN resources mediate the density response of ants on senita cacti in the Sonoran Desert and their context-dependent use of floral resources. Removal of EFN resources reduced the aggregative density of ants on plants, both on hourly and daily time scales. Yet, the increased aggregative ant density on plants with EFN resources decreased rather than increased ant use of floral resources, including contacts with and time spent in flowers. Behavioral assays showed no confounding effect of floral deterrents on ant-flower interactions. Thus, ant use of floral resources depends on the supply of EFN resources, which mediates the potential for both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions by increasing the aggregative density of ants protecting plants, while concurrently distracting ants from floral resources. Nevertheless, only certain years and populations of study showed an increase in plant reproduction through herbivore protection or ant distraction from floral resources. Despite pronounced effects of EFN resources mediating the aggregative density of ants on plants and their context-dependent use of floral resources, consumer-resource interactions remained largely commensalistic. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Ant-plant interaction; Antagonism; Commensalism; Consumer-resource interaction; Context dependent; Density mediated; Distraction; Extrafloral nectar (EFN); Mutualism; Pachycereus schottii; Protection; Senita,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46749156703

His logic was straightforward and rested on the assumption that colonization was infrequent; thus, mate limitation favored the establishment of self-fertilizing individuals. In support of Baker's rule, many authors have documented high frequencies of self-compatibility on islands, and recent work has solidified the generality of Baker's ideas. The genus Lycium (Solanaceae) has ca. 80 species distributed worldwide, and phylogenetic studies suggest that Lycium originated in South America and dispersed to the Old World a single time. Previous analyses of the S-RNase gene, which controls the stylar component of self-incompatibility, have shown that gametophytically controlled self-incompatibility is ancestral within the genus, making Lycium a good model for investigating Baker's assertions concerning reproductive assurance following oceanic dispersal. Lycium is also useful for investigations of reproductive evolution, given that species vary both in sexual expression and the presence of self-incompatibility. A model for the evolution of gender dimorphism suggests that polyploidy breaks down self-incompatibility, leading to the evolution of gender dimorphism, which arises as an alternative outcrossing mechanism. There is a perfect association of dimorphic gender expression, polyploidy, and self-compatibility (vs. cosexuality, diploidy, and self-incompatibility) among North American Lycium. Although the association between ploidy level and gender expression also holds for African Lycium, to date no studies of mating systems have been initiated in Old World species. Here, using controlled pollinations, we document strong self-incompatibility in two cosexual, diploid species of African Lycium. Further, we sequence the S-RNase gene in 15 individuals from five cosexual, diploid species of African Lycium and recover 24 putative alleles. Genealogical analyses indicate reduced trans-generic diversity of S-RNases in the Old World compared to the New World. We suggest that genetic diversity at this locus was reduced as a result of a founder event, but, despite the bottleneck, self-incompatibility was maintained in the Old World.

While a plant's primary pollinator should strongly influence floral phenotype, selective pressures may also be exerted by other flower visitors or competition with other plants for pollination. Species of the primarily bat-pollinated genus Burmeistera (Campanulaceae) frequently cooccur, with up to four species in a given site, and broadly overlap in flowering phenology, typically flowering throughout the year. The genus displays extensive interspecific variation in floral morphology in the degree that the reproductive parts (anthers and stigma) are exserted outside of the corolla, and species can be roughly classified as either long or short-exserted. I tested two hypotheses regarding the functional significance of such variation: (1) exsertion lengths correspond to pollination by bat species of different sizes; and (2) variation serves to partition pollinator's bodies spatially and thus reduces interspecific pollen transfer. I captured bats in Ecuador to evaluate the identity and location of the Burmeistera pollen they were carrying. Results show that exsertion does not correspond to specialization on different pollinators; different bat species carried pollen of both flower types just as frequently. In support of the second hypothesis, pollen from flowers of different exsertion lengths was found to occur on different regions of bats' heads. This may serve to reduce competition for pollination among coexisting Burmeistera. © 2008 The Author(s).",Campanulaceae; Floral morphology; Hummingbird; Neotropics; Pollination; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42649097918

The advantage of large inflorescences in terms of attractiveness was larger for racemes and umbels than for panicles, whereas the effect of inter-inflorescence distance on the number of successive probes was smaller for racemes than for panicles and umbels. The number of flowers probed per visit increased almost proportionally with display size when fewer flowers were empty, whereas the number increased less when many flowers were empty.

Despite its conservation status and rarity, no information is available on its reproductive biology. As the flower is the structure directly involved in pollinator attraction, its morphological and functional traits have major effects on the reproductive success of the plant. In this work, the flower biology and breeding system of P. vayredae were studied to evaluate how they affect the reproductive outcome in natural populations. Flower morphology, flower rewards, and male and female functioning throughout the lifespan of the flower were assessed. Pollination experiments, involving pollinator exclusion and pollen from different sources, were conducted, and the pollen ovule index was determined. Female fitness and the occurrence of pollen limitation were assessed in three natural populations over 2 years by observing the presence of pollen on the stigma, pollen tube development, and fruit production. Polygala vayredae flowers are elaborate and long-lived with nectar rewards. The floral traits are well adapted to xenogamy and entomophily, which are in accordance with the observed breeding system and auto-incompatibility system. No mechanism of reproductive assurance was observed and P. vayredae strictly depends on pollinators to set fruit. Low fruit production was observed in the studied populations, which was largely the result of scarce, unreliable, and/or inefficient pollinators and poor pollen quality. In addition, available resources may be a limiting factor. The reproductive strategy of P. vayredae prevents inbreeding depression by a self-incompatibility system, which in years of scarce pollinators is overcome by the plant habit. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Endemic species; Pollen limitation; Reproductive system; Secondary pollen presentation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049108420

Megagametogenesis in H. johnsonii was compared with megagametophyte development in Halophila decipiens, a related species known to readily produce viable seeds. In both species, ovules were structurally similar, megaspore mother cells were seen in premeiotic ovules, and linear tetrads and megagametophytes with two to eight nuclei were present in postmeiotic ovules. However, H. decipiens postmeiotic ovules had a chalazal pouch that was absent in the postmeiotic ovules of H. johnsonii. Late-stage H. decipiens ovules also contained embryos, indicating that they had been fertilized, whereas all late-stage H. johnsonii ovules were degrading and showed no signs of fertilization. These observations suggest that meiosis does occur in H. johnsonii megasporocytes, leading to the formation of viable megagametophytes and egg cells that could be fertilized if pollination occurred.

Clarkia breweri flowers emit a mixture of eugenol and isoeugenol, while Petunia hybrida flowers emit mostly isoeugenol with small amounts of eugenol. We recently reported the identification of a petunia enzyme, isoeugenol synthase 1 (PhIGS1) that catalyzes the formation of isoeugenol, and an Ocimum basilicum (basil) enzyme, eugenol synthase 1 (ObEGS1), that produces eugenol. ObEGS1 and PhIGS1 both utilize coniferyl acetate, are 52% sequence identical, and belong to a family of NADPH-dependent reductases involved in secondary metabolism. Here we show that C. breweri flowers have two closely related proteins (96% identity), CbIGS1 and CbEGS1, that are similar to ObEGS1 (58% and 59% identity, respectively) and catalyze the formation of isoeugenol and eugenol, respectively. In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that substitution of only a single residue can substantially affect the product specificity of these enzymes. A third C. breweri enzyme identified, CbEGS2, also catalyzes the formation of eugenol from coniferyl acetate and is only 46% identical to CbIGS1 and CbEGS1 but more similar (>70%) to other types of reductases. We also found that petunia flowers contain an enzyme, PhEGS1, that is highly similar to CbEGS2 (82% identity) and that converts coniferyl acetate to eugenol. Our results indicate that plant enzymes with EGS and IGS activities have arisen multiple times and in different protein lineages. © 2008 The Authors.",Biochemistry; Plant volatile; Protein structure; Scent; Secondary metabolism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42549126270

These metabolites are one of the main means used by plants to attract pollinators, thereby ensuring plant survival. A lack of knowledge about factors regulating scent production has prevented the successful enhancement of volatile phenylpropanoid production in flowers. In this study, the Production of Anthocyanin Pigment1 (Pap1) Myb transcription factor from Arabidopsis thaliana, known to regulate the production of non-volatile phenylpropanoids, including anthocyanins, was stably introduced into Petunia hybrida. In addition to an increase in pigmentation, Pap1-transgenic petunia flowers demonstrated an increase of up to tenfold in the production of volatile phenylpropanoid/benzenoid compounds. The dramatic increase in volatile production corresponded to the native nocturnal rhythms of volatile production in petunia. The application of phenylalanine to Pap1-transgenic flowers led to an increase in the otherwise negligible levels of volatiles emitted during the day to nocturnal levels. On the basis of gene expression profiling and the levels of pathway intermediates, it is proposed that both increased metabolic flux and transcriptional activation of scent and colour genes underlie the enhancement of petunia flower colour and scent production by Pap1. The co-ordinated regulation of metabolic steps within or between pathways involved in vital plant functions, as shown here for two showy traits determining plant-pollinator interactions, provides a clear advantage for plant survival. The use of a regulatory factor that activates scent production creates a new biotechnological strategy for the metabolic architecture of fragrance, leading to the creation of novel genetic variability for breeding purposes. © 2008 The Authors.",Flavonoids; Fragrance; Petunia; Phenylpropanoids; Production of Anthocyanin Pigment1 (Pap1); Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749103979

In the Beta vulgaris complex, the sugar beet seed multiplication areas have been the scene of inadvertent pollination of sugar beet seed bearers by wild ruderal pollen donors, generating a weedy form of beet which infests sugar beet fields in European countries. Up to now, investigations of evolutionary dynamics of genetic diversity within the B. vulgaris complex were addressed using few genetical markers and few accessions. In this study, we tackled this issue using a panel of complementary markers: five nuclear microsatellite loci, four mitochondrial minisatellite loci and one chloroplastic PCR-RFLP marker. We sampled 1,640 individuals that illustrate the actual distribution of inland ruderal beets of South Western France, weed beets and wild sea beets of northern France as well as the diversity of 35 contemporary European diploid cultivars. Nuclear genetic diversity in weed beets appeared to be as high as those of ruderal beets and sea beets, whereas the narrowness of cultivar accessions was confirmed. This genetic bottleneck in cultivars is even more important in the cytoplasmic genome as only one haplotype was found among all sugar beet cultivars. The large majority of weed beet populations also presented this unique cytoplasmic haplotype, as expected owing to their maternal cultivated origin. Nonetheless, various cytoplasmic haplotypes were found within three populations of weed beets, implying wild-to-weed seed flows. Finally, our findings gave new insights into the genetical relationships between the components of the B. vulgaris complex: (1) we found a very strong genetic divergence between wild sea beet and other relatives, which was unexpected given the recent evolutionary history and the full cross-compatibility of all taxa and (2) we definitely confirmed that the classification into cultivated, wild, ruderal and weed forms according to their geographical location, phenotype or their domesticated status is clearly in accordance with genetic clustering despite the very recent domestication process of sugar beet. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049103004

Here, we investigated the pollination biology of a globally threatened plant, Polemonium vanbruntiae, using hand-pollination experiments in four natural populations to determine the degree of pollen limitation. In addition, we investigated the mating system and extent to which plants can self-fertilize by comparing geitonogamously and autonomously self-fertilized plants with purely outcrossed and open-pollinated plants. In contrast to several of the more common species of Polemonium, we found no pollen limitation in any of the four populations of P. vanbruntiae over two years. The lack of pollen limitation was best explained by the capacity for P. vanbruntiae to both geitonogamously and autonomously self-fertilize, unlike some of its more common congeners. Geitonogamously selfed flowers set equivalent numbers of seeds when compared to purely outcrossed and open-pollinated flowers. However, autonomously selfed flowers produced significantly fewer seeds, demonstrating that pollinators play an important role as inter- and intra-plant pollen vectors in this system. Our results support the reproductive assurance hypothesis, whereby the ability to self assures fertilization for plants in small populations. Self-compatibility in Polemonium vanbruntiae may decrease extinction risk of isolated populations experiencing a stochastic pollinator pool within a restricted geographic range. In addition, a mixed-mating strategy, including the ability for clonal reproduction, may explain the ability for this rare species to persist in small, fragmented populations. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Even though the intensity of pesticide use by Open Pollinated Variety (OPV) growers is less relative to hybrid growers, the average use of pesticides is substantially greater than the estimated optimum use levels. We then used Bt trial plot data to estimate the potential benefits that Bt technology might provide in terms of reduction in pesticide application. If the adoption of GE eggplant reduces the pesticide use by 52%, as is reported from the field trials of GE eggplant, that will result in a saving of Rs. 6844/acre for hybrid growers and Rs. 2784/acre for OPV growers.

Fourier UMS 2925 UJF-CNRS, Université Joseph Fourier, F-38041 Grenoble, France","The alpine sedge Carex curvula ssp. curvula is a clonal, dominant graminoid found in the European Alps, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees and in some of the Balkan Mountains. It is a late-successional species of acidophilous alpine meadows that occurs on sites that were covered by ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM). By applying the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing, we attempted to identify the recolonization routes followed by the species after the last ice retreat. We relied on the genetic diversity of 37 populations covering the entire distributional range of the species. As a wind-pollinated species, C. curvula is characterized by a low level of population genetic differentiation. Nuclear and chloroplast data both support the hypothesis of a long-term separation of Eastern (Balkans and Carpathians) and Western (Alps and Pyrenees) lineages. In the Alps, a continuum of genetic depauperation from the east to the west may be related to a recolonization wave originating in the eastern-most parts of the chain, where the main glacial refugium was likely located. The Pyrenean populations are nested within the western Alps group and show a low level of genetic diversity, probably due to recent long-distance colonization. In contrast to the Alps, we found no phylogeographical structure in the Carpathians. The combination of reduced ice extension during the Würm period and the presence of large areas of siliceous substrate at suitable elevation suggest that in contrast to populations in the Alps, the species in the Carpathians underwent a local vertical migration rather than extinction and recolonization over long distance. © 2008 The Authors.",AFLPs; Alpine plants; Carex curvula; cpDNA; European Alpine System; Phylogeography; Pleistocene refugia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049095699

It is expected that shade-intolerant pioneer tree species have different patterns of genetic polymorphism and population structure than climax species. We studied patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at four putative starch pathway loci (agpSA, agpSB, agpL, and GBSSI) in Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, a shade-intolerant pioneer tree species that occupies forest gaps in warm-temperate forests of East Asia. Genetic diversity was lower within each population than among populations, and differentiation among populations was high across the loci (FST = 0.32-0.64), as expected from the insect-pollinated breeding system and the metapopulation structure of this pioneer species. Numbers of haplotypes were smaller than those expected from the observed numbers of segregating sites. Single haplotypes accounted for more than 47% of all the sampled genes at the respective loci. These variation patterns were incompatible with neutral predictions for populations of a finite island model. Complex population dynamics, such as bottleneck and/or admixture, in the history of this pioneer tree species might have resulted in the observed patterns of genetic variation and population structure, which are different from those of climax wind-pollinated tree species, such as conifers. In contrast to the other loci investigated in this study, agpL showed nearly no variation in Z. ailanthoides (one singleton only), but there was some extent of variation in a closely related species, Zanthoxylum schinifolium. This suggests possibly a recent selective sweep at or near the locus in Z. ailanthoides. © 2008 The Authors.",Nucleotide variation; Pioneer tree; Population structure; Zanthoxylum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049134825

In range-edge populations of plants, the scarcity of suitable habitat may be reflected in small population sizes which may result in increased self-pollination and/or inbreeding and an increase in the incidence of clonal reproduction. These factors may result in a decrease in levels of genetic diversity and a loss of potential adaptive variation that may compromise species' ability to cope with changes in their environment, an issue that is particularly relevant today with the current concern surrounding global climate change and its effect on species' distributional ranges. In the present study, we have compared the levels of clonal reproduction in the one-sided wintergreen Orthilia secunda (L.) House in (1) populations from its main continuous distribution range, (2) populations occurring on the limits of the continuous range, and (3) peripheral populations outwith the species' continuous distribution range. Range-edge populations in Scotland and Sweden displayed significantly lower genotypic richness and diversity than those from the main area of the species' distribution in these countries. Populations from Ireland, which occur in the temperate zone rather than the boreal conditions that are the preferred habitat for the species, and which represent relict populations left over from cooler periods in the Earth's history, displayed no within-population genetic diversity, suggesting a complete lack of sexual reproduction. Furthermore, the genetic distinctiveness of the Irish populations, which contained alleles not found in either the Scottish or the Swedish populations, highlights the value of 'trailing edge' populations and supports the concept of 'parochial conservation', namely the conservation of species that are locally rare but globally common. © 2008 The Authors.",Clonal growth; Distribution rage; Fragmentation; Orthilia secunda; Range-edge effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149103321

Epistasis can be modeled as a QTL by genetic background interaction. Association mapping models lend themselves to fitting such an interaction because they often include both main marker and genetic background factors. In this study, I review a model that fits the QTL by background interaction as an added random effect in the now standard mixed model framework of association analyses. The model is applied to four-generation pedigrees where the objective is to predict the genotypic values of fourth-generation individuals that have not been phenotyped. In particular, I look at how well epistatic effects are estimated under two levels of inbreeding. Interaction detection power was 8% and 65% for pedigrees of 240 randomly mated individuals when the interaction generated 6% and 20% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Power increased to 21% and 94% for these conditions when evaluated individuals were inbred by selfing four times. The interaction variance was estimated in an unbiased way under both levels of inbreeding, but its mean squared error was reduced by 40% to 70% when estimated in inbred relative to randomly mated individuals. The performance of the epistatic model was also enhanced relative to the additive model by inbreeding. These results are promising for the application of the model to typically self-pollinating crops such as wheat and soybean. © 2007 GovernmentEmployee: United States Department of Agriculture.",Association mapping; Epistasis; Genetic background; Inbreeding; Pedigree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42249099191

This study was conducted to assess the utility of the uncharacterized resistance gene Lr60 (formerly LrW2) for the development of resistant cultivars by demonstrating its novelty, genetic location, and the breadth of resistance that it confers. Haploide of a single gene line carrying Lr60 (RL6172) were pollinated with a susceptible cultivar to generate hybrids with random chromosome deficiencies arising from irregular meiosis of the haploid. Out of 488 hybrids, four were susceptible to leaf rust. All susceptible hybrids lacked several polymorphic microsatellite alleles from RL6172 that are specific to chromosome 1D. Analysis of an F2 population confirmed that Lr60 was located on the short arm of 1D, 8.4 cM distal to the microsatellite BARC149. Since Lr21 is also located on 1DS a cross was made between single gene lines of Lr21 and Lr60; five susceptible plants recovered in F2 out of 1141 individuals tested were confirmed with progeny tests. This ratio (5:1136) gives an estimated recombination frequency of 13% between Lr21 and Lr60. RL6172 was tested with 37 isolates of P. triticina, encompassing a diversity of virulence found in North America; one isolate was virulent.

The population was subjected to two cycles of selfed progeny recurrent selection for grain yield. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine genetic distances among the parental inbred lines of the M3S population (M3S progenitors), the M3S population before and after two cycles of recurrent selection, and elite inbred lines representing the BSSS and Lancaster heterotic group; and (ii) to examine the effect of two cycles of recurrent selection on allele frequency changes in the population. Nine M3S progenitors, three BSSS lines, and three Lancaster lines were genotyped at 24 SSR loci, out of which nine randomly chosen loci were used for genotyping 96 individuals from both C0 (the M3S population before selection) and from C2 (M3S population after two cycles of selection). A total of 101 alleles were detected across 24 loci in the 15 lines, whereas 83 alleles were found in the nine M3S progenitors. Among the latter 83 alleles 31 were unique, i.e. found only in one of the progenitors. Mean genetic distance among nine M3S progenitors was 0.61 indicating a broad genetic base of the M3S population. High mean genetic distance was found between M3S progenitors and BSSS lines (0.69) and M3S progenitors and Lancaster lines (0.71). This indicates that the M3S population represents a germplasm source unrelated to both the BSSS and Lancaster germplasm. Mean genetic distance between the M3S population and BSSS as well as Lancaster lines decreased slightly after two cycles of recurrent selection suggesting the need to introduce testers from both groups in future selection in the M3S population in order to maintain heterotic complementarity of the M3S population to these groups. A test of selective neutrality identified several non-neutral loci in the population whose allele frequency changes from the C0 to the C2 cannot be explained by genetic drift. The majority of non-neutral alleles, whose frequency increased after two cycles of selection, were present in at least one line from the BSSS or Lancaster heterotic group. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Allele frequency; Exotic germplasm; Heterotic pattern; Maize; Recurrent selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149174931

We studied cleistogamous (CL) and chasmogamous (CH) fruit set of spring-flowering Viola praemorsa Dougl. ex Lindl. along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, testing whether pollen limitation or allocation to CL reproduction covaried with timing of flowering onset, within and across sites. Contrary to predictions, we found no pollen limitation of reproduction at any site, and variation among sites in the pattern of allocation to cleistogamy was not related to growing season length. Differences in reproductive strategy between early- and late-flowering plants within sites were attributable to differences in plant size, with relative allocation to cleistogamy increasing with size. This pattern has been found in some other cleistogamous species, and may indicate a cost of large CH floral displays, perhaps associated with geitonogamy or herbivory. We found no experimental evidence for resource reallocation in response to CH reproductive output, although a weak negative relationship between CH and CL fruit set across a larger sample of unmanipulated plants suggests such a trade-off. The significance of cleistogamy may be clarified by studying how pollinator visitation, self-pollination, and herbivore damage vary temporally and with floral display size. © 2008 NRC.",Allometry; Cleistogamy; Plasticity; Pollen limitation; Rocky mountain biological laboratory; Violaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44849084201

The induced MS mutation (ms-str) was preserved in the F1 and BC1 progenies and was genetically unstable: many families produced semisterile and fertile revertants, whose progenies again contained semisterile and sterile mutants. The ms-str mutation was maintained through eight generations via selection and self-pollination of semisterile plants. The mutation was inherited as a recessive nuclear mutation in test crosses of sterile plants segregated in the progenies of fertile and semisterile revertants and was expressed only in single cases in a test cross for ms-str transfer through pollen of hybrids with restored male fertility. Recessive nuclear mutations determining a low plant height (dwarfness) and the lack of waxy bloom on the stem and leaves (bloomless) were found in male-sterile plants with the ms-str mutation. Cytological analysis of sterile plants reveal multiple abnormalities at various pollen development stages and in tapetal cells: cytomyxis, defects of chromosome conjugation, distorted cytokinesis in meiotic division II, a lack of tetrad separation, a defective formation of the microspore coat, generation of microspores with two to four nuclei, and the formation of micronuclei and large vacuoles in tapetal cells.

Because in the new world, the nectars of bat-pollinated flowers tend to be dominated by hexoses, we predicted that at equicaloric concentrations, bats would ingest higher volumes of hexoses than sucrose-containing nectars. We investigated the intake response of three species of Neotropical bats, Leptonycteris curasoae, Glossophaga soricina and Artibeus jamaicensis, to sugar solutions of varying concentrations (292, 438, 584, 730, 876, and 1,022 mmol L-1) consisting of either sucrose or 1:1 mixtures of glucose and fructose solutions. Bats did not show differences in their intake response to sucrose and 1:1 glucose-fructose solutions, indicating that digestion and absorption in bat intestines are designed under the principle of symmorphosis, in which no step is more limiting than the other. Our results also suggest that, on the basis of energy intake, bats should not prefer hexoses over sucrose. We used a mathematical model that uses the rate of sucrose hydrolysis measured in vitro and the small intestinal volume of bats to predict the rate of nectar intake as a function of sugar concentration.

This pattern was basically congruent in all morphometric and previous molecular (AFLP) analyses. Further geographical structuring within the western or the eastern lineage was not obvious from the morphological data. Contradictory to molecular results, plants from the Alpes Maritimes/Liguria region clearly formed part of the western group in the morphometric analysis. The two A. montana lineages uncovered might be best described at subspecific rank, the western subsp. montana and the eastern subsp. jacquinii (A. Kern.) Hayek. Morphological discrimination between subspecies was mainly based on floral characters, and hence, subspecies montana is characterised by larger flowers, i.e., longer petals and calyx tubes. Within each of the two subspecies, regression analyses revealed correlations between vegetative traits and altitudinal as well as latitudinal origin, indicating plastic growth of A. montana modified by climatic conditions.

Using phylogenetic approaches, the expectation that parallel cladogenesis should occur between parasites and hosts has been validated in some studies, but most others provided evidence for frequent host shifts. Here we examine the evolutionary history of the association between Microbotryum fungi that cause anther smut disease and their Caryophyllaceous hosts. We investigated the congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, inferred cospeciation events and host shifts, and assessed whether geography or plant ecology could have facilitated the putative host shifts identified. For cophylogeny analyses on microorganisms, parasite strains isolated from different host species are generally considered to represent independent evolutionary lineages, often without checking whether some strains actually belong to the same generalist species. Such an approach may mistake intraspecific nodes for speciation events and thus bias the results of cophylogeny analyses if generalist species are found on closely related hosts. A second aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the impact of species delimitation on the inferences of cospeciation. Results. We inferred a multiple gene phylogeny of anther smut strains from 21 host plants from several geographic origins, complementing a previous study on the delimitation of fungal species and their host specificities. We also inferred a multi-gene phylogeny of their host plants, and the two phylogenies were compared. A significant level of cospeciation was found when each host species was considered to harbour a specific parasite strain, i.e. when generalist parasite species were not recognized as such. This approach overestimated the frequency of cocladogenesis because individual parasite species capable of infecting multiple host species (i.e. generalists) were found on closely related hosts. When generalist parasite species were appropriately delimited and only a single representative of each species was retained, cospeciation events were not more frequent than expected under a random distribution, and many host shifts were inferred. Current geographic distributions of host species seemed to be of little relevance for understanding the putative historical host shifts, because most fungal species had overlapping geographic ranges. We did detect some ecological similarities, including shared pollinators and habitat types, between host species that were diseased by closely related anther smut species. Overall, genetic similarity underlying the host-parasite interactions appeared to have the most important influence on specialization and host-shifts: generalist multi-host parasite species were found on closely related plant species, and related species in the Microbotryum phylogeny were associated with members of the same host clade. Conclusion. We showed here that Microbotryum species have evolved through frequent host shifts to moderately distant hosts, and we show further that accurate delimitation of parasite species is essential for interpreting cophylogeny studies. © 2008 Refrégier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449135641

Nonetheless, the record has fallen short of its potential (and of its potentially synergistic value) because, although it is better understood than ever, there are still problems in identifying fossils' affinities that have not been fully resolved and that have major implications with respect to determining timing in angiosperm evolution with either molecular clock-based models or minimum-age node mapping. This issue is of particular significance with respect to early angiosperm radiation, where more careful studies of existing specimens seem to have unrealized value for increasing our comprehension of floral evolution and homology, potentially in the context of strides in understanding MADS-box genes. Subjective methods with typological overtones are still often used in identifying fossils, even though phylogenetic context is available. Identification using phylogenetic context, among other things, does not obscure relative character changes within monophyletic groups, does not lend itself to facultative interpretation of affinities to suit outcomes of various models, and, thus, does not impede our understanding of angiosperm evolutionary history. Nonetheless, a reasonahly good fossil record of angiosperms is emerging from the combined efforts of many laboratories and, when carefully evaluated, reveals an interesting and possibly informative pattern of flowering plant evolution.

Bumble bees have some control over their temperature, but have been shown to forage at warmer flowers when given a choice, suggesting that there is some advantage to them of foraging at warm flowers (such as reducing the energy required to raise their body to flight temperature before leaving the flower). We describe a model that considers how a heat reward affects the foraging behaviour in a thermogenic central-place forager (such as a bumble bee). We show that although the pollinator should spend a longer time on individual flowers if they are warm, the increase in total visit time is likely to be small. The pollinator's net rate of energy gain will be increased by landing on warmer flowers. Therefore, if a plant provides a heat reward, it could reduce the amount of nectar it produces, whilst still providing its pollinator with the same net rate of gain. We suggest how heat rewards may link with plant life history strategies. © 2008 Rands, Whitney.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-44349122953

In northwest Argentina, pollinator visits to grapefruit, a self-compatible but pollinator-dependent crop, decline by approximately 50% at 1km from forest edges. We evaluated whether this decrease in visitation also reduces the pollination service in this crop. We analysed the quantity and quality of pollen deposited on stigmas, and associated limitation of fruit production at increasing distances (edge: 10, 100, 500 and 1000m) from the remnants of Yungas forest. We also examined the quantitative and qualitative efficiency of honeybees as pollen vectors. Pollen receipt and pollen tubes in styles decreased with increasing distance from forest edge; however, this decline did not affect fruit production. Supplementation of natural pollen with self- and cross-pollen revealed that both pollen quantity and quality limited fruit production. Despite pollen limitation, honeybees cannot raise fruit production because they often do not deposit sufficient high-quality pollen per visit to elicit fruit development. However, declines in visitation frequency well below seven visits during a flower's lifespan could decrease production beyond current yields. In this context, the preservation of forest remnants, which act as pollinator sources, could contribute to resilience in crop production. Like wild plants, pollen limitation of the yield among animal-pollinated crops may be common and indicative not only of pollinator scarcity, but also of poor pollination quality, whereby pollinator efficiency, rather than just abundance, can play a broader role than previously appreciated. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Africanized honeybees; Agriculture; Citrus paradisi; Crop pollination; Ecosystem services; Pollen quantity and quality limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40049086360

These antagonists can directly and indirectly affect plant fitness by forcing hummingbirds to modify their foraging behaviour. The ecological significance of antagonists for the plant-hummingbird interaction is largely unknown. The goal of this work was to investigate the combined effects of herbivores and nectar robbers on the interaction between the distylous herb Bouvardia ternifolia and its hummingbird visitors. By simulating different intensities of herbivory and nectar theft, we studied (1) changes in the foraging behaviour of visiting hummingbirds, (2) differences in the use of floral morphs, (3) changes in nectar characteristics, and (4) their effects on plant fitness. On plants of both morphs, higher levels of leaf defoliation and nectar removal were related to a decrease in the number of visited flowers, an increase in the time-to-arrival of hummingbirds, and a reduction in nectar availability and sugar production. The pollination experiments showed that seed production on both floral morphs was significantly reduced by herbivory and nectar removal.

We monitored seed deposition under their canopies over a year and sampled the established vegetation after 3 y. Dispersal distances were estimated for captured seeds and established plants, assuming that the nearest conspecific adult rooted within 75 m of the fig tree was the mother. Seventy tree and shrub species were captured in seed rain, with a cumulative density of 833 seeds-m-2.y-1. After 3 y, 77 species of trees and shrubs had established (density: 4.0 plants m-2). Seeds &lt; 7 mm in diameter were frequently dispersed over distances greater than 75 m across the pasture. Larger seeds were dispersed over shorter distances and in much lower numbers, but once they had arrived at the isolated fig trees, germination and establishment success was higher than it was for small seeds. Rainforest trees isolated in pastures have an enormous potential for catalyzing and accelerating secondary succession by acting as regeneration nuclei.

The individuals were sampled from a 4-ha natural forest plot (200 m × 200 m), which are consisted of three size classes including newly regenerated individuals such as regenerated individuals (REG class; stem diameter at breast height (DBH), 5-110 cm), remaining individuals (REM class; DBH ? 110 cm), and old stumps. Genetic diversity was similar between the three groups. These results suggest that genes from the old growth forest may have been passed on to the next generation (i.e., the current forest). DNA extraction and analysis from old stumps was partly successful and we could compare the genetic diversity between old stumps and living trees using four microsatellite loci. Patterns of spatial genetic structure detected by analyses of the nuclear and chloroplast markers differed substantially; all nuclear markers showed significant positive autocorrelation (P < 0.05) over short distances, but the chloroplast marker showed no significant autocorrelation over any distance. We concluded that Moran's I spatial autocorrelation pattern for the chloroplast microsatellite may have been influenced by the extensive pollen flow characteristic of this species, because chloroplast DNA of C. japonica is paternally inherited through pollen and is a wind-pollinated species that produces abundant pollen every few years. In contrast, Moran's I spatial autocorrelation pattern for nuclear microsatellites may reflect limited seed dispersal in gaps where the forest has regenerated and low levels of seed shadow overlap due to past logging. The average seed dispersal distance was 86.0 m at the study site and about 34.0% of the seeds were from the outside of the site, which revealed by parentage analysis. The individuals remaining after logging, and the extensive pollen flow from outside our study plot, may play important roles in maintaining the forests on this island. Gaps created by the selective logging activities appear to have been important for the regeneration of this species in the past but in the present time, natural disturbances such as typhoon and landslide are also important for gap creation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A field study was conducted to compare and analyze the relative importance of the various component traits causing variation in nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of safflower under Mediterranean conditions. Ten genotypes, four hybrids and six open-pollinated varieties, were grown for two growing seasons without irrigation, on a silty clay (Typic Xerorthent) soil. Seed yield varied greatly among genotypes and ranged from 923 to 3391 kg ha-1. Hybrids showed a mean seed yield superiority of 12.5% against varieties. Seed yield was the most important component of seed N yield and its contribution to the total variation in seed N yield among genotypes was at least 53%. NUE for biomass production during the seed-filling period was lower compared to that during the vegetative period. Genotypes differed in NUE for seed production (NUEs) and the differences followed those of nitrogen harvest index (NHI). The contribution of NHI to the total variation in NUEs among genotypes was much greater compared to that of yield per unit seed nitrogen and accounted for more than 79%. NUEs is positively correlated with seed yield, suggesting that high yield was probably associated with more efficient exploitation of nitrogen. NUEs is negatively correlated with (leaf + stem) N concentration at maturity, meaning that low straw N concentration may be indication of higher NUEs. Results indicated that selection for NUE in safflower should be based on multiple criteria rather than just one criterion and also should be accompanied by evaluation for seed yield to ensure an improvement in both traits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Apple fruit develop over a period of 150 days from anthesis to fully ripe. An array representing approximately 13000 genes (15726 oligonucleotides of 45-55 bases) designed from apple ESTs has been used to study gene expression over eight time points during fruit development. This analysis of gene expression lays the groundwork for a molecular understanding of fruit growth and development in apple. Results. Using ANOVA analysis of the microarray data, 1955 genes showed significant changes in expression over this time course. Expression of genes is coordinated with four major patterns of expression observed: high in floral buds; high during cell division; high when starch levels and cell expansion rates peak; and high during ripening. Functional analysis associated cell cycle genes with early fruit development and three core cell cycle genes are significantly up-regulated in the early stages of fruit development. Starch metabolic genes were associated with changes in starch levels during fruit development. Comparison with microarrays of ethylene-treated apple fruit identified a group of ethylene induced genes also induced in normal fruit ripening. Comparison with fruit development microarrays in tomato has been used to identify 16 genes for which expression patterns are similar in apple and tomato and these genes may play fundamental roles in fruit development. The early phase of cell division and tissue specification that occurs in the first 35 days after pollination has been associated with up-regulation of a cluster of genes that includes core cell cycle genes. Conclusion. Gene expression in apple fruit is coordinated with specific developmental stages. The array results are reproducible and comparisons with experiments in other species has been used to identify genes that may play a fundamental role in fruit development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41649086110

We studied the potential for cultivation of F. pumila var. awkeotsang. Young cuttings of F. pumila var. awkeotsang were planted in Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang Cultivation Garden, Dayangke Mountain (long. E 119°03', lat. N 25°42', altitude 420 m). They established easily and plants reached reproductive size after just 3 years. However, although wild populations of F. pumila var. awkeotsang existed 35 km from our plot, and populations of another variety, F. pumila var. pumila, thought to be pollinated by the same wasp, occurred at the site, pollination success was initially zero. Pollination experiments indicated that F. pumila var. awkeotsang is reproductively isolated from F. pumila var. pumila, and that the pollinator of the latter cannot breed in the syconia of the former variety. Deliberate introduction of wild pollinators led to the establishment of a pollinator population in the cultivated plot containing 60 male plants. However, syconia abortion rates were still high (>50%) after four years. This was partly due to the seasonal phenology of F. pumila var. awkeotsang and the low overlap between wasp reproduction and the receptive phases in the fig. We expect pollination rates to increase as the plants get larger, or if more male fig plants are established. ©2008 Balaban.",Cultivation; Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang; Pollination biology; Wiebesia pumilae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549112582

Because associations between figs and their pollinating wasps are horizontally transmitted, partner encounter is a crucial step, and is mediated by the emission by receptive figs of the volatile compounds that are detected by the pollinator. However, pollinator attraction is probably not the only function of the volatile compounds produced by figs. Other likely functions include signalling to wasps that a fig has already been pollinated, and deterring or defending against visitors with negative effects on developing figs or the pollinators they contain. The functions of volatile compounds will also change over the course of fig development, and the composition of the odour bouquet is thus also likely to vary. However, this variation and its likely functional importance have rarely been studied. To address these questions, we investigated changes in the composition of the bouquet of volatile compounds, and in the rate of emission of odour components, before, during and after the phase of receptivity to pollinators in Ficus hispida, in Yunnan (China). This first study of the dynamics of variation in signal composition throughout the cycle of fig development, provides support for the hypothesis of chemical mimicry in dioecious figs. ©2008 Balaban.",Chemical mediation; Fig-fig wasp mutualism; Temporal variation; Volatile organic compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549167022

In functionally dioecious figs, the fig wasp larvae can only develop in the figs of male plants. Female plants have 'tomb blossoms' where the pollinators fail to reproduce and only seeds develop. Some foundress fig wasps can nonetheless reemerge from figs after entry, so why do they not rapidly leave female figs without pollinating them? Selection on fig wasp behaviour generated on male fig trees, but expressed on both male and female plants, may provide an explanation. Wasps that re-emerge from female figs have no wings and will never reproduce. Consequently, natural selection cannot influence wasp behaviour once they enter a female fig and their behaviour should reflect what is optimal in male figs. Consistent with this explanation, pollinator behaviour in female figs was found to be largely similar to that in male figs. Thus pollination may be achieved because pollinators are doing what would have been best for them, if they had reached a fig where reproduction was possible. ©2008 Balaban.",Dioecy; Ficus; Liporrhopalum; Pollination; Vicarious selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549157021

In contrast to previous phylogenetic studies of figs, this sampling design allowed us to evaluate the degree to which different alleles within loci, and different loci within individual species suggest consistent phylogenetic relationships among both distantly and closely related figs. We found multiple instances within both tpi and g3pdh genes in which different haplotypes were not monophyletic by species. Haplotype and reconciliation analyses suggested that genetic exchange among closely related figs is necessary to fully explain the patterns. In contrast, analyses of multiple loci from multiple individuals in the wasps are monophyletic by species, producing a well resolved species phylogeny. Although combining fig genetic data sets produced a resolved and robust fig topology, no fig phylogenies based on either combined or individual gene trees showed any significant correspondence with the wasp tree. Recent studies have shown that many of the fig species considered here have multiple pollinators and several share genetically indistinguishable pollinators. Together with these genetic results, it appears that a strict co-speciation model does not adequately describe the general evolutionary dynamics of the fig/wasp mutualism, particularly for sympatric, closely related species (within section). Importantly, these results emphasize the need to consider multiple genes, multiple individuals, and systematic scale in order to conduct and interpret robust co-phylogenetic studies of figs and their pollinating wasps. ©2008 Balaban.",Coevolution; Cophylogeny; Cospeciation; Ficus; Hybridization; Mutualism; Paralogy; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549154797

Syconia (inflorescences) occurred on both species all year round, but pre-floral and interfloral syconia were much commoner than the wasp-receptive and wasp-emitting phases in both species. The temporal overlap of the wasp-receptive and wasp-emitting phases on a single tree indicated that self-pollination was possible in both species and that pollinators may sometimes persist through multiple generations on one tree. This sexual phase overlap was commoner in F. rubiginosa than in F. racemosa. The two species also differed in their general within-tree asynchrony, with a higher diversity of phases on F. rubiginosa than on F. racemosa. The time from syconium initiation to ripening was very similar in F. rubiginosa (mean = 48.51 days) and F. racemosa (mean = 43.53 days). However, there was much more variation within and between trees for F. rubiginosa. In addition, the wasp-receptive phase was found to last up to 5 days (mean = 4.38) in F. rubiginosa.

This study of the ecology of two Sycoscapter species provides the first evidence of their parasitoid role and also demonstrates their impact on abundance of B. tawanensis in F. formosana in relation to season. Females of the two Sycoscapter species are differentiated by their different ovipositor lengths. The species with the longer ovipositor was more abundant overall, but less so than the species with the shorter ovipositor in the winter crop. There was no obvious difference in the timing of oviposition between the two species, with females of both species appearing on male syconia 1-6 weeks after pollination. Females oviposited externally and their larvae fed on the B. tawanensis larvae. The two Sycoscapter species reduced the abundance of B. tawanensis larvae by 62% within parasitized syconia, and by 54% for all syconia. There was a seasonal variation both in the abundance of wasps and in correlation relationships between pollinators and parasitoids, i.e. parasitoid proportions were much higher and the correlations were mainly significant in the winter and spring crops. We suggest the pollinator and the fig exerts two levels of control on the rate of parasitism by Sycoscapter, and this may help to maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship between the three organisms. ©2008 Balaban.",Blastophasga taiwanensis; Ficus formosana; Guandaushi Forest Station; Mutualism; Parasitoid; Sycoscapter,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549164483

Figs entered by pollen-free fig wasps were more likely to abort. Furthermore, in those figs that did not abort, there were fewer pollinator progeny than in pollinated figs. When pollen-carrying lone females were prevented from ovipositing in male figs, by having the tips of their ovipositors removed, they appeared to be unharmed, but all the figs aborted. This suggests either that male figs may require oviposition, not pollen, in order to be retained by the trees, or that behavioral changes in the wasps prevented pollination from occurring. ©2008 Balaban.",Agaonidae; Dioecy; Ficus; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549140233

In most cases, they oviposit into the figs from outside without providing any pollination service. In this study, we used several different methods (adhesive traps and direct standardized field observations) to assess the colonization sequence of a diverse fig wasp fauna associated with Ficus citrifolia, section Americana, in Brazil. They consistently showed a temporal partitioning in colonization among non-pollinating fig wasp species. Idarnes species belonging to the flavicollis and incerta groups colonized figs just before or during the fig receptive phase. In contrast, Idarnes females belonging to the carme group oviposited one to three weeks later, mainly in the middle of the inter-floral phase. Eurytoma, Heterandrium, Physothorax and Torymus were later colonizers, and laid eggs either in the middle or during the late inter-floral phase. The results suggest that these Neotropical fig wasps have different strategies of resource exploitation, even among species belonging to the same genus. ©2008 Balaban.",Agaonidae; Ficus; Mutualism; Resource exploitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549126803

To test the specificity-breakdown hypothesis, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial COI gene sequences of Mexican fig-pollinating wasps collected from each fig species at various localities. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear division of Mexican fig pollinators into two major groups: one pollinating the Ficus species of subgenus Pharmacosycea; and the other pollinating Ficus subgenus Urostigma. In some cases, wasps pollinating the same fig species do not form clades, and in others, pollinators of different fig species have identical gene sequences. Incorporation of COI sequences of Panamanian fig-pollinating wasps also showed inconsistency between pollinator phylogeny and host fig species. These results suggest: 1) the possible breakdown of the ""one-to-one rule"" in Mexican fig-wasp associations; 2) the absence of phylogenetic evidence for cospeciation between the Ficus species and its pollinators; and 3) host switching may occur frequently among these pollinating wasps.

Figs are pollinated by highly specific, but short-lived (1-3 days), wasps that breed inside the inflorescence. Thus, continuous flowering at the population-level is a necessary condition for the mutualism to persist. In other respects, however, the ecology of co-occurring fig species varies greatly. Leaf and inflorescence production among 15 species of monoecious hemi-epiphytic fig (Ficus; section Conosyce) were studied over 4 years in an aseasonal lowland rainforest in Borneo. At the community-level, leaf production was significantly reduced following wetter periods. Many individuals (28%) did not flower during the entire 4 year period. Of individuals that flowered, the mean frequency of reproductive episodes was low and varied from 0.3 to 1.7 times per year. Species with smaller fruit flowered significantly more than those with large fruit, which translated into a substantial difference in fruit production (10.6 vs 1.9 kg pulp dry weight ha-1 yr-1, respectively). Among species pollinated by different wasp genera, there was a significant difference in the mean densities of individuals with receptive inflorescences, and there was a substantial difference in the duration of the wasp emergence phase. The predicted mean minimum distance from a plant with wasps emerging to a receptive individual was, thus, very different between wasp genera; and varied from 3.6 km to 31.8 km across species. Management of protected areas should take into account the low levels of fruit production, especially of species with large fruit, and that fig populations must be dependent on wasps arriving from forests over a wide landscape. ©2008 Balaban.",Agaonidae; Co-evolution; Ficus; Fruit production; Mutualism; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549150444

The wasp population can therefore only survive if there are some fig trees flowering at all times of the year. In highly seasonal habitats, when only a few trees occur at a site, gaps in fruiting may lead to the extinction of the local pollinator population. This paper demonstrates that in a dioecious fig tree, Ficus hirta, the fig wasp population can be maintained successfully within an individual plant, through the strong intra-tree asynchrony in flowering. By experimentally bagging trees, we showed that the pollinating wasps (Blastophaga javana hilli) could live for two generations, and the non-pollinating wasps (Sycoscapter sp.) for up to three generations in a closed intra-tree system. However, there was a sharp decline in wasp abundance, as indicated by declining sex ratios (0.31±0.05 to 0.28±0.098, mean±SD, not significantly) and the flower occupancy (11.31±1.49 to 1.78±0.59 by the 3rd generation, mean±SD, significantly) before their ultimate extinction, indicating that the wasp populations were not sustainable.

The production of seeds and wasps varied significantly between seasons, with extremely low production of seeds and wasp offspring in syconia sampled during particularly cool dry months. Most individual trees exhibited intra-tree asynchronous flowering, and typically bore many synconia at different developmental phases. Moreover, within asynchronous crops, earlier ripening syconia were often much larger than normal later ripening figs. These early-ripening syconia were occupied by non-pollinators with very large galls, and fewer seeds were produced. Therefore, it appears that early ripening was not adaptive for F. microcarpa.

We studied the structure of these insect communities on each of the four common fig species. Of 116,719 insects collected, six orders, 23 families, 40 genera, and 65 species were identified. Pollinators comprised the fewest species, but the largest number of individuals. There was an abundance of non-pollinators on monoecious figs (F. racemosa and F. benjamina). In dioecious figs, male figs harbored more non-pollinators, but female figs attracted more pulp eating insects. The position and size of inflorescences on the different fig species were important traits in determining the associated insect communities. Cauliflorous species of fig (those bearing figs on trunks and branches, rather than on the ends of twigs), and those with larger fruits, supported both individually abundant, and species-rich, insect communities. Both diversity and evenness of insect communities were higher in primary rainforest, as compared with secondary forest.

Bees trained on multimodal flowers learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited the previously rewarded flowers at a higher rate than bees trained on unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed-accuracy trade-off; bees that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed-accuracy relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy across range of decision speeds.

Thus, similarly to other studies of dioecious species in which detailed data on wasp and seed production have been reported, female inflorescences (figs) generally appear to initiate more flowers than male inflorescences, and produce more seeds than male inflorescences produce female pollinator wasps. Compared with published studies of seed and wasp production in monoecious figs, F. hirta appears more efficient on a per syconium basis at both seed and female pollinator wasp production than monoecious species characterized by large numbers of flowers, high average foundress numbers, and high non-pollinator wasp loads. These comparisons suggest conditions that favor selection for (and stability of) either the monoecious or dioecious breeding system in figs. ©2008 Balaban.",Breeding system stability; Dioecious; Ficus hirta; Fig wasps; Monoecious; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549089755

These factors were studied in the tropical tree species Bagassa guianensis Aubl. occurring in a low-density population in the Brazilian Amazon forest. Genetic diversity was compared among offspring, juveniles and adult trees, before and after selective logging. Non-significant differences were observed between these samples. The harvest of 61% of the adult trees caused the loss of three alleles in the reproductive population. However, these alleles were present in juveniles and offspring and so were not lost from the population. SGS was detected up to 300 m before logging in the overall and adult populations. After logging, significant SGS was not observed. Deviations from random matings were evident throughout biparental inbreeding (1 - over(t, ?)s = 0.067, P &lt; 0.05), correlated mating (over(r, ?)p (m) = 0.193, P &lt; 0.05), and differentiation in pollen gene pool (over(?, ?)ft = 0.081, P &lt; 0.05). The effective number of pollen donors was estimated as 5-7 trees. The distance of pollen gene dispersal was estimated as 308-961 m, depending on the dispersal model used (normal and exponential) and assumed population density. The estimated neighbourhood pollination area (Aep) ranges from 81 to 812 ha, depending also on the assumed population density. Reproduction by obligatory outcrossing, pollen immigration from trees outside of the plot, the long-pollen dispersal distance, and large Aep suggested that the species can be resilient to the impacts of logging. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Box 810, Granville, OH 43023, United States","While herbivory has traditionally been studied as damage to leaves, florivory - herbivory to flowers prior to seed set - can also have large effects on plant fitness. Florivory can decrease fitness directly, either through the destruction of gametes or through alterations to plant physiology during fruit set, and can also change the appearance of a flower, deterring pollinators and reducing seed set. In order to distinguish between these hypotheses, it is necessary to both damage flowers and add pollen in excess to study the effects of damage on pollen limitation. Very few studies have used this technique over the lifetime of a plant. Here I describe a series of experiments showing the effects of natural and artificial damage on reproductive success in the annual plant Nemophila menziesii (Hydrophyllaceae, sensu lato). I show that natural and artificial petal damage decreased radial symmetry relative to controls and that both types of damage deterred pollinator activity. Both naturally damaged flowers and artificially damaged flowers in the field set fewer fruit or seed relative to undamaged control flowers. Finally, in an experiment crossing artificial petal damage with pollen addition, petal damage alone over the lifetime of this plant decreased female fitness, but only after a threshold of damage was reached. The fitness effect appeared to be direct because there was no detectable effect of pollen addition on the relationship between florivory and fitness. This result implies that both damaged and undamaged plants show similar amounts of pollen limitation and suggests that pollinator-mediated effects contributed little to the negative effects of florivory on female fitness. Florivores may thus be an under-appreciated agent of selection in certain plants, although more experimental manipulation of florivory is needed to determine if it is important over a range of taxa. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Floral herbivory; Florivory; Nemophila menziesii; Petal herbivory; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149180119

In fact, technical limitations have prevented clear observation of ECM secretion. Here, we report the detailed topographic changes on the stigma surface that accompanies intraspecies and interspecies pollination in tobacco using contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results, which show the dynamics and time course of ECM secretion after pollination, indicate that a certain pattern of secretion already exists on the stigma prior to pollination. Intraspecies induced a two-step response, characterized by topographical changes on the stigma surface several hours after pollination, which was distinct from the pattern of ECM secretion induced by interspecies pollination. This difference was confirmed by root-mean-square analysis, which assessed the roughness of the stigma surface. Our findings indicate that compatible pollination not only induces ECM secretion from the stigma, but also results in a specific distribution of the ECM. Thus, this study demonstrates the powerful potential of AFM in studying the pollen-stigma interaction. © 2008 Science in China Press.",AFM (atomic force microscopy); Pollination; Stigma; Tobacco,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44349161187

To address these concerns in the case of maize crops, we have chosen a modelling approach. Our aim was to simulate cross-pollination in the case of existing agricultural landscapes, taking into account the effect of climate and cropping techniques in order to forecast gene escape from genetically modified maize to non-GM maize. The resulting spatially explicit model, MAPOD (Matricial Approach to POllen Dispersal), is presented in this paper. A preliminary evaluation is also provided. Pollen exchanges between GM and non-GM maize crops are simulated and influencing factors such as field sizes and shapes, distribution of GM and non-GM fields in the agricultural landscape as well as flowering dates and dynamics are integrated. Model parameter values were either derived from existing models of pollen dispersal or estimated from experimental field studies. The preliminary evaluation of MAPOD was carried out by comparing simulation results with data from two French and one American gene flow field trials. MAPOD was found to provide good average predictive values. Examples of output data illustrate the capacity of the model to simulate a wide range of agricultural contexts. These simulation results provide a basis for designing coexistence rules and monitoring procedure set-up. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae) is a monophyletic group of tropical trees endemic to Madagascar and surrounding islands. The Masoala assemblage of Coleeae, in northeastern Madagascar, utilizes four mechanisms for avoiding competition via niche specialization: (1) morphologically via characters that comprise syndromes, explaining part of the pattern in this system - although the syndrome concept is not perfect; (2) spatially via vertical stratification and potentially pollen placement; (3) temporally via phenological stagger; (4) ethologically via flowering duration and display. The 13 sympatric species of understory treelets and canopy trees did receive low flower visitor numbers. Contrary to the prevailing view of pollination systems where generalized systems predict equivalency between floral traits and pollinators, I found that different pollinators pollinated the 13 species of trees, that floral characters of different trees did not overlap in multidimensional phenotype space, and that few species of trees were visited by more than two pollinator groups.

We describe regions of plant genomes that affect pollinator preferences for two species of Louisiana Irises, Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva, and their artificial hybrids. Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva possess bee and bird-pollination syndromes, respectively. Hummingbirds preferred I. fulva and under-visited both I. brevicaulis and backcrosses toward this species. Lepidopterans preferred I. fulva and backcrosses toward I. fulva, but also under-visited I. brevicaulis and I. brevicaulis backcrosses. Bumblebees preferred I. brevicaulis and F1 hybrids and rarely visited I. fulva. Although all three pollen vectors preferred one or the other species, these preferences did not prevent visitation to other hybrid/parental classes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, in reciprocal BC1 mapping populations, defined the genetic architecture of loci that affected pollinator behavior.

Examination of the breeding system suggests that the flowers are self-compatible, but need pollen vectors for successful reproduction. The flower is rewardless; over 15 insects belonging to Araneida, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera were recorded as flower visitors, but most only alighted or rested on the flower. In the total 32 h of observations over 2 years, female Lasioglossum bees were found to be the most frequent visitors and the only pollinators. They showed a high visitation frequency and, surprisingly, re-visited the same flowers frequently. Cypripedium henryi probably attracts pollinators visiting the flowers through general food deception (odour components, colour, false nectar guides), as well as special structures (slippery labellum, slippery staminode). Although three Lasioglossum species visited the flowers, only L. sauterum Fan et Ebmer was found with pollen. Lasioglossum flavohirtum Ebmer was large and climbed out from the entrance. Morphologically, L. sichuanense Fan et Ebmer could be considered as a potential pollinator, but the collected specimens were found to have no pollen of C. henryi on their bodies. It was speculated that the particular floral scent of C. henryi discouraged the entrance of L. sichuanense bees. Lasioglossum sauterum was matched morphologically to the flower, but not all of the visitations resulted in effective pollinations, as some flowers of C. henryi were frequently re-visited and the pollen mass had been taken away by bees on previous visitations. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Breeding system; Deceptive pollination; Floral functional morphology; Lasioglossum; Re-visitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749098290

We studied the interactions between pollinator visitation rates to flowers, pollen removal and deposition, flower size, and nectar removal frequency on seed production in P. roseus. We combine observational and experimental studies in two contrasting natural populations. Our manual pollinations revealed that P. roseus is fully self-compatible. Autonomous self- and manual self-pollinated flowers matured as many seeds as when outcrossed, but outcrossing seems to become better than selfing as the flowering season progressed. Early in the season flowers that were bagged and hand-selfed, hand-outcrossed, or autonomously selfed, or unbagged and naturally pollinated had equal seed set in all four treatments. But later in the season, outcross pollen gave approximately twice as much seed set as the two self-treatments. Low levels of pollen receipt and pollen removal were consistent with the long time elapsed for a given plant to be visited by hummingbirds, which suggests pollen shortage in both sites. Despite differences in pollinator visitation rates to flowers, probability of flower visitation, removal and deposition of pollen, and nectar production rates between populations, we found that total nectar production had no effect on seed production at either site. The daily nectar secretion rate of 0.3-0.65 mg sugar per flower per 1-3 days was low relative to other hummingbird-adapted Penstemon species (typical range: 1.5-5 mg sugar per flower), and it might be intermediate between hummingbird- and bee-adapted Penstemon flowers. Our results support the hypothesis about a shift toward hummingbird pollination, and provide an example of a 'despecialized' Penstemon species, which attracts high-energy pollinators (hummingbirds) and profits from outcrossing, but retains bee-syndrome floral traits and low sugar production rates. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Hummingbirds; Mexico; Nectar; Penstemon; Plantaginaceae; Pollen transfer; Pollination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41849149656

Floral diversity was tested for association with divergent pollinator preferences in a group of four closely related wildflower species: the yellow-flowered Mimulus luteus var. luteus and the red-pigmented M. l. variegatus, M. naiandinus and M. cupreus. • Methods: Patterns of pollinator visitation were evaluated in natural plant populations in central Chile, including both single-species and mixed-species sites. Floral anthocyanin pigments were identified, and floral morphology and nectar variation were quantified in a common garden experiment using seeds collected from the study sites. • Key Results: Mimulus l. luteus, M. l. variegatus and M. naiandinus are morphologically similar and share a single generalist bumblebee pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii. Mimulus cupreus differs significantly from the first three taxa in corolla shape as well as nectar characteristics, and had far fewer pollinator visits. • Conclusions: This system shows limited potential for pollinator-mediated restriction of gene flow as a function of flower colour, and no evidence of transition to a novel pollinator. Mimulus cupreus may experience reduced interspecific gene flow due to a lack of bumblebee visitation, but not because of its red pigmentation: rare yellow morphs are equally undervisited by pollinators. Overall, the results suggest that factors other than pollinator shifts may contribute to the maintenance of floral diversity in these Chilean Mimulus species. © The Author 2008.

We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining floral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying floral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and flower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and floral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically fit the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are significantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and flower color did not show any consistently significant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors. © 2008 The Author(s).",Floral display; Flower color; Nectar; PGLS; Pollinators; Quantitative convergence index,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749106913

However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43% and 31% of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis; Ecological networks; Generalization; Interaction strength; Invasive species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149107399

Four pollination treatments (caged with bumblebee (BP), caged with honeybee (HP), open-pollinated (OP) and pollinator excluded (EP)) were applied. The effects of honeybee and bumblebee on alfalfa seed yield, number of pods per raceme, number of seeds per pod, and podding rate were investigated. The results of seed yield indicate that interaction between treatment groups and seasons was significant (p<0.01). The highest seed yield in alfalfa was found in OP (66.19kg/ha) in the spring followed by BP (56.48kg/ha), HP (49.20kg/ha) and EP (2.44kg/ha).

From a sample of 70 species (representing 25 genera) previously affiliated with the Tetramerium lineage, 68 are included therein. Our analyses excluded Papuasian Calycacanthus and Neotropical Streblacanthus monospermus from the Tetramerium lineage; however, two species described in Justicia (J. gonzalezii and J. medranoi) and a Malagasy species of uncertain generic affinities are nested within the lineage. A monophyletic Tetramerium lineage consists of 23 currently recognized genera with at least 168 species, more than 70% of which occur in the New World. Old World Chlamydocardia and Clinacanthus are serially sister to all other members of the lineage. Other Old World taxa consist of: Ecbolium clade (all sampled species of Ecbolium plus Malagasy Populina richardii), Megalochlamys clade (Megalochlamys, Trichaulax and the unidentified Malagasy species), and two isolated taxa (Angkalanthus and Chorisochora). All analyses strongly support monophyly of the New World Tetramerium lineage. The basal clades of New World plants, all with nototribic flowers, are: 1) the taxonomically heterogeneous but palynologically consistent Mirandea clade, and 2) the Pachystachys clade + the South American Anisacanthus clade. The second is sister to all other NW plants, referred to here as the core Tetramerium lineage. We recognize five clades within the core Tetramerium lineage related as follows: (Henrya clade (Carlowrightia parviflora clade (North American Anisacanthus clade (core Carlowrightia clade + Tetramerium)))). Macromorphological synapomorphies are unknown for the Tetramerium lineage and for many of its constituent clades. However, we propose sternotribic flowers as synapomorphic for the core Tetramerium lineage, and flowers with the lower-central lobe of the corolla modified into a keel as a synapomorphy for a lineage consisting of Tetramerium and the core Carlowrightia clade. Palynological characters provide putative synapomorphies for some clades (e.g. Ecbolium clade, Mirandea clade) and autapomorphies for several species (e.g. Mexacanthus mcvaughii, Trichaulax mwasumbii). An Old World origin is postulated for the Tetramerium lineage, and we posit a single dispersal event to America and subsequent extensive radiation there, especially in arid zones of Mexico and adjacent regions. Taxonomic implications of our results are extensive. Notably, many traditionally recognized genera (e.g. Anisacanthus, Carlowrightia, Mirandea) are not monophyletic and emphasis on floral form often has been phylogenetically misleading; for example, floral adaptations to pollination by hummingbirds have evolved at least eight times in the New World Tetramerium lineage. © Copyright 2008 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",Biogeography; Cp sequences; nrITS; Phylogeny; Pollen; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45749123180

Franco have a restricted and fragmented natural distribution, especially in the central region, therefore there is a risk that these populations will be lost due to the effects of climatic change. With the purpose of suggesting adequate measures for their conservation, an evaluation was made of the mating pattern and its effect on the inbreeding level in three natural populations of P. menziesii, two of the north and one of the central region of México, based on the percentage of cross pollination. With the information of five polymorphic loci, the allelic frequencies of pollen and ovules were estimated, along with the proportion of mating in each population using multilocus (tm) and single locus (ts) models. No differences were found in the allelic frequencies of pollen and ovules, which indicates that the pollen comes from the same community as the mother trees. The value of t?m in the two northern populations was close to 90%; in the central population it was 49% as a result of a high percentage of selfing. The similarity of the estimations of the degree of cross breeding (tm and t?s), indicates that selfing is the principal form of inbreeding in the populations evaluated. Despite the high percentage of cross breeding in the northern populations, the paternity correlation coefficient in them was over 60%, indicating a reduced number of pollinating trees.

How the silique microenvironment modulates the composition and amount of storage reserves in the seeds is of interest because of the important agricultural role played by canola (B. rapa and Brassica napus) as an oilseed. Because of the small volume and dynamic nature of this microenvironment in Brassica, a standardized system was needed to study the environmental role played in storage reserve deposition. For this purpose we have developed a silique culture system that permits maturation of seed in vitro. Siliques excised from plants just 11 days after pollination complete the ripening of their seeds after 20 days of culture in light (200 ?mol/m2/s) on MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose, 0.25 mg/l BAP, and 0.025 mg/l NAA. Cytochemical localization and biochemical analyses revealed that storage reserves were affected by the in vitro maturation system. Although following a comparable ripening timeline to that occurring on the plant, and producing fully germinable seeds, in vitro maturation resulted in a 40% reduction in seed weight and the mature seeds contained decreased lipid, but increased protein, starch and soluble carbohydrates. To study the internal atmosphere surrounding the seeds, we developed a method to capture silique gases in helium with subsequent quantification of O2 and CO2 in the sample by gas chromatography. Analysis of the internal silique atmosphere showed that in vitro siliques provided seeds with a less oxygenated environment than they experience attached to the plant. Carbon dioxide concentrations remained high later into the maturation sequence in vitro than on the plant. When sampling gases from siliques attached to plants, we found multiple samples from the same plant resulted in higher variance than when only a single silique was sampled, suggesting that connection to the plant directly influences internal silique gases. Lower O2 in the in vitro siliques was correlated with depressed lipid content in their mature seeds, supporting the conclusion that oxygen availability limits lipid accumulation. Previous studies showed how environmental factors influence Brassica embryos grown in tissue culture. These systems fail to preserve the component of metabolic regulation that is enforced by the silique wall tissues. Our in vitro maturation system provides a useful tool for specialized investigations since both the gaseous and hormonal environments can be readily manipulated. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We created a database of the alien plants in seminatural habitats in Ireland that included data on taxonomy, invasive status, invasion history, distribution, and biological and ecological plant characteristics. We used information from this database to determine the importance of these factors in increasing the ability of species to become naturalized and invasive. More specifically, we used two multiple logistic regressions to identify factors that distinguish naturalized from casual alien plant species and invasive from noninvasive, naturalized alien species. Clonal growth, moisture-indicator value, nitrogen-indicator value, native range, and date of first record affected (in order of decreasing importance) the probability of naturalization. Factors that distinguished invasive from noninvasive species were ornamental introduction, hermaphrodite flowers, pollination mode, being invasive elsewhere, onset of flowering season, moisture-indicator value, native range, and date of first record. Incorporation of phylogenetic information had little influence on the results, suggesting that the capacity of alien species to naturalize and become invasive evolved largely independently in several phylogenetic lineages. Whereas some of the variables were important for both transitions, others were only important for naturalization or for invasion. This emphasizes the importance of studying different stages of the invasion process when looking for mechanisms of becoming a successful invasive plant, instead of simply comparing invasive with noninvasive alien species. Our results also suggest that a combination of species traits and other variables is likely to produce the most accurate prediction of invasions. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.",Biological invasions; Database of alien plants in Ireland; Exotic species; Invasion history; Invasive status; Irish alien flora; Phylogenetic corrections; Species traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41849127044

We sampled totally 58 populations in flood plains in the surroundings of Bremen, North-western Germany. In all five species, there were positive correlations between the number of seeds (total seed mass) and plant height, as well as between germination and seed mass. Seed traits values and/or germination were negatively affected by small population size, in Euphorbia, Lathyrus and Pseudolysimachion additionally by high population isolation. There were also significant effects of soil quality, but these were less consistent across species. The contribution of population size and isolation, compared to soil quality, to the variance explained in the reproductive components was especially high in Euphorbia and Lathyrus, the only two species depending on insect pollination. The results indicate that the five species are likely to decline as a consequence of decreased plant fitness in small and/or isolated populations, probably caused by pollen limitation. The studied species may be representative for the group of river corridor plants as a whole that are often restricted to isolated remnants of near-natural flood plain vegetation in a matrix of heavily used agricultural land. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In behavioral experiments, approximately 20% of the flowers from both species and hybrids were attractive to the ""wrong"" or both pollinator species. Analysis of the EAD-active hydrocarbons in the floral odor showed an overlap in the two species, whereby hybrid individuals could not be separated from O. iricolor. The genetic analysis confirmed the hybridization of the species. Plants of O. iricolor and hybrids are genetically indistinguishable and form an O. iricolor x lupercalis hybrid population. Remaining plants of O. lupercalis will possibly be displaced by the O. iricolor x lupercalis hybrid population in the future. Our study showed that in deceptive orchids, variation in the pollinator attracting cues, in this case, scent, can be the first step for speciation and at the same time cause the displacement of a species.","AFLP; GC-EAD; Hybridization; Ophrys, Orchidaceae; Pollination; Sardinia; Sexual deception",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049140812

Stigma-anther distance was correlated with style length. Species of microlepidoptera were the most frequent floral visitors, and are possibly important pollinator taxa. Variation in flower, fruit, and seed morphology, as well as seed germination was significant among populations from the islands.

In tomato, parthenocarpy is considered as an attractive trait to solve the problems of fruit setting under unfavorable conditions. We studied the genetics of parthenocarpy in two different lines, IL5-1 and IVT-line 1, both carrying Solanum habrochaites chromosome segments. Parthenocarpy in IL5-1 is under the control of two QTLs, one on chromosome 4 (pat4.1) and one on chromosome 5 (pat5.1). IVT-line 1 also contains two parthenocarpy QTLs, one on chromosome 4 (pat4.2) and one on chromosome 9 (pat9.1). In addition, we identified one stigma exsertion locus in IL5-1, located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (se5.1). It is likely that pat4.1, from IL5-1 and pat4.2, from IVT-line 1, both located near the centromere of chromosome 4 are allelic. By making use of the microsynteny between tomato and Arabidopsis in this genetic region, we identified ARF8 as a potential candidate gene for these two QTLs. ARF8 is known to act as an inhibitor for further carpel development in Arabidopsis, in absence of pollination/fertilization. Expression of an aberrant form of the Arabidopsis ARF8 gene, in tomato, has been found to cause parthenocarpy. This candidate gene approach may lead to the first isolation of a parthenocarpy gene in tomato and will allow further use in several crop species. © 2008 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43349092023

By making use of a database containing more than two decades of honey bee (Apis mellifera) hive poisoning incidents from the United Kingdom (Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme [WIIS]) and corresponding pesticide use surveys, we attempted to explain honey bee poisoning incidents in the field using models derived from pesticide use information, laboratory-generated bee toxicity data (defined as a hazard ratio; application rate divided by LD50), and physico-chemical properties of the applied pesticides. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between honey bee poisoning incidents in the field and these parameters. In analyzing models with multiple dimensions, we selected the best model by the best subset method, an iterative method based on maximum likelihood estimation, and Akaike's information criterion. Results suggested that the size of the area treated and hazard ratios calculated from application rates and oral or contact toxicity (but the latter especially) can be used to predict the likelihood that honey bee mortality will occur. Model predictions also suggest that some insecticides carry an extreme risk for bees, despite the lack of documented incidents. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.",Honey bees; Incidents; Mortality; Pesticides; Risk assessment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43649088716

Both the primary and secondary sexual characteristics of the cyathia of the protogynous andromonoecious species Euphorbia nicaeensis were analysed according to their sex and arrangement on the inflorescence. • Methods: The production of male and hermaphrodite cyathia at each inflorescence level was surveyed in two natural populations. The longevity, size, pollen production and viability, and nectar secretion of both types of cyathia were checked between inflorescence levels and between sexes at the only level at which they occur together. This sampling method makes it possible to know whether differences between cyathia types are based on sex or are attributable to inflorescence development. • Key Results: Male cyathia were produced predominantly at the first and second inflorescence levels, whereas at levels 3-5, the cyathia were almost exclusively hermaphrodite. Viable pollen production by male cyathia at the second inflorescence level was higher than that of hermaphrodite cyathia at the third level but, when males and hermaphrodites at the same level were compared, their pollen production was similar. Male and hermaphrodite cyathia were similar in size, irrespective of the inflorescence level, although the exclusively hermaphrodite cyathia of the last level were smaller. Both cyathium types produced similar amounts of sugar. However, male cyathia produced nectar during their whole lifespans, whereas hermaphrodites produced it exclusively during their male phase. Moreover, the nectary activity of male cyathia started earlier in the day than that of hermaphrodites. • Conclusions: An apparent floral dimorphism exists in the primary sexual characteristics of Euphorbia nicaeensis because differences in pollen production between cyathium types are due to theirs positions. Similarly, differences affecting most secondary sexual characteristics are only apparent between the two cyathium types. However, E. nicaeensis shows a true but slight floral dimorphism in some of the secondary sex characters related to nectar secretion. The lack of nectar production by the female phase of the hermaphrodite cyathia of E. nicaeensis indicates that this is a deceit-pollinated species. © The Author 2008.

The ecology and evolution of foliar-feeding insects are thought to be closely tied to plant secondary compounds. Although secondary compounds are also abundant in floral nectar, their role in mediating pollinator preference and performance remains relatively unexplored. 2. This study tested the effects of an alkaloid, gelsemine, found in the nectar of Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens L., Loganiaceae), on the performance of a native solitary bee (Osmia lignaria lignaria Say, Megachilidae). Nectar gelsemine reduces visits from pollinators, including O. lignaria lignaria, and gelsemine is toxic to vertebrates and possibly non-native honey bees (Apis mellifera L., Apidae). To test the hypothesis that the deterrent effects of nectar gelsemine reflect negative consequences for pollinator performance, O. lignaria lignaria offspring provisions were supplemented with nectar containing different gelsemine concentrations. Effects on larval development time, prepupa cocoon mass, adult emergence, and adult mass were measured. 3. Nectar gelsemine had no effect on any measure of offspring performance. Thus, although gelsemine deters foraging by adult bees, this behaviour did not optimize offspring performance under the experimental conditions of this study. In contrast, sugar added to nectar treatments increased offspring mass. 4. While adult pollinators may avoid nectar with secondary compounds, this could hinder offspring performance by reducing sugar in provisions if nectar is limiting in the environment. Preference-performance trade-offs, which are studied extensively with foliar herbivores, have seldom been tested for pollinating plant consumers. Future studies of nectar secondary compounds and insect pollinator preference and performance may help to integrate studies of foliage-consuming insect herbivores with nectar-consuming insect pollinators. © 2008 The Authors.",Gelsemine; Gelsemium sempervirens; Insect foraging; Osmia lignaria; Pollinator performance; Secondary compounds; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40349094562

In the present study, we investigated hybridization under field conditions between crop lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and its wild relative prickly lettuce (L. serriola), two cross-compatible, predominantly autogamous and insect pollinated species. In 2003 and 2004, we estimated the rates of hybridization between L. sativa and L. serriola in close-to-reality field experiments carried out in two locations of Northern Switzerland. Seeds set by the experimental wild plants were collected and sown (44 352 in 2003 and 252 345 in 2004). Progeny was screened morphologically for detecting natural hybrids. Prior to the experiment, specific RAPD markers were used to confirm that morphological characters were reliable for hybrid identification. Hybridization occurred up to the maximal distance tested (40 m), and hybridization rates varied between 0 to 26%, decreasing with distance. More than 80% of the wild plants produced at least one hybrid (incidence of hybridization, IH) at 0 m and 1 m. It equaled 4 to 5% at 40 m.

One such species is Lobelia boykinii. We conducted a study of L. boykinii to determine which factors most influence its reproductive success. We examined the species' breeding system, population dynamics, degree of pollen limitation, importance of sexual versus asexual reproduction, and the role of fungal and herbivore damage on fruit production in three Carolina bay populations in North Carolina. Pollen manipulations revealed that L. boykinii is an obligate outcrosser and that sexual reproduction is pollen-limited. Population size and density, which influence pollinator attraction, can fluctuate greatly over years in the same population. The three populations differed with respects to population size and density, capsule production, vegetative reproduction, and ramet survival, and differences are partially attributable to variation in the degree and timing of herbivory and fungal damage. Herbivory ranged from < 1 to 55 of flowering shoots. Fungal infection decreased fruit production only when it coincided with the period of floral development. Our results indicate that focusing on one ecological factor to prevent extant populations from going extinct is insufficient. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence L. boykinii's reproductive success, and populations differ in which factors most strongly influence reproduction. Given this suite of constraints, management strategies should include maintaining as many of the largest remnant populations as possible. © Torrey Botanical Club.",Breeding system; Carolina bays; Demography; Endemic; Flowering phenology; Fungal infection; Lobelia boykinii; Pollen limitation; Rare plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77749320884

Based on reports that outcrossing decreased as distance from Bt cotton increased in small-scale studies, we hypothesized that increasing refuge width or distance from Bt fields would reduce outcrossing. In a large-scale study in Arizona, we quantified Bt seed in refuges of experimental and commercial fields, comparing outcrossing between in-field (narrow) and external (wide) refuges and among rows of refuges at various distances from Bt fields. Some refuges, including those in tightly controlled experimental plots, contained up to 8% adventitious Bt plants. Some, but not all, Bt plants likely resulted Bt from seed in the non-Bt seed bags. We did not detect a difference in outcrossing between in-field and external refuges. However, statistical power was low because outcrossing was low ( 0.4% of seeds) in both treatments. Higher outcrossing levels ( 4.6% of seeds) were observed in the studies measuring outcrossing at various distances from Bt fields, yet outcrossing did not decrease as the distance from Bt fields increased. We hypothesize that Bt plants in refuges cross-pollinated surrounding non- plants, overshadowing the expected association between distance from Bt fields and outcrossing. © 2008 ISBR EDP Sciences.",Adventitious plants; Bt cotton; Gene flow; Outcrossing; Refuge,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449153729

A hierarchical analysis of Mediterranean maritime pine mating system (61 mother trees from 24 plots, clustered in three populations) was used to identify factors affecting mating patterns and to fit pollen dispersal kernels. Levels of ovule and seed abortion, multi- and single-locus outcrossing rates and correlated paternity were estimated from progeny arrays and correlated with ecological stand variables and biometric tree measures. Pollen dispersal kernels were fitted using TwoGener and KinDist indirect methods and simulations were carried out to identify relevant factors affecting correlated paternity. Maritime pine showed high outcrossing rates (tm and ts ?0.96) and relatively low levels of correlated paternity [an rp of 0.018 (Ritland's estimate) or 0.048 (Hardy's estimate)], although higher than in other anemophilous tree species. Mating system parameters had high variation at the single-tree level (99-100%) but no stand or population effect was detected. At the single-tree level, outcrossing rates were correlated with tree (diameter and height) and crown size. In addition, correlated paternity showed a significant negative correlation with tree height, height to crown base and height to the largest crown width, probably reflecting the importance of the trees' 'ecological neighborhoods'. Indirectly estimated pollen dispersal kernels were very leptokurtic (exponential-power distributions with ??0.5), with mean dispersal distances from 78.4 to 174.4 m. Fitted dispersal kernels will be useful in building explicit simulation models that include dispersal functions, and which will contribute to current conservation and management programs for maritime pine. Nevertheless, the numerical simulations showed that restricted dispersal, male fertility and phenological overlap could only partially explain the observed levels of correlated paternity; so other factors may also be relevant for the management of this valuable forest tree species. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Correlated paternity; KinDist; Mediterranean forest; Outcrossing rates; Pinus pinaster; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149167114

SGS can also be influenced by historical events such as admixture of differentiated gene pools. We analysed the fine-scale SGS in six populations of a pioneer tree species endemic to Central Africa, Aucoumea klaineana. To infer the impacts of limited gene dispersal, population history and habitat fragmentation on isolation by distance, we followed a stepwise approach consisting of a Bayesian clustering method to detect differentiated gene pools followed by the analysis of kinship-distance curves. Interestingly, despite considerable variation in density, the five populations situated under continuous forest cover displayed very similar extent of SGS. This is likely due to an increase in dispersal distance with decreased tree density. Admixture between two gene pools was detected in one of these five populations creating a distinctive pattern of SGS. In the last population sampled in open habitat, the genetic diversity was in the same range as in the other populations despite a recent habitat fragmentation. This result may due to the increase of gene dispersal compensating the effect of the disturbance as suggested by the reduced extent of SGS estimated in this population. Thus, in A. klaineana, the balance between drift and dispersal may facilitate the maintenance of genetic diversity. Finally, from the strength of the SGS and population density, an indirect estimate of gene dispersal distances was obtained for one site: the quadratic mean parent-offspring distance, ?g, ranged between 210 m and 570 m. © 2008 The Authors.",Insect pollination; Lower Guinea Forest Domain; Spatial genetic structure isolation by distance; Wind dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42049096766

It is typically planted well out of its natural range and may therefore present a significant risk of exotic pollen-mediated gene flow into native eucalypt populations. This risk was assessed by documenting levels of flowering within plantations, frequencies at which reproductively compatible native species are found adjacent to plantations, levels of F1 hybridisation with native populations, and the existence of F1 hybrid seedling recruitment. We surveyed over 300 plantations across southern Australia over two years. Flower abundance was found to be low with an average of 3% of trees found to flower on an inside row and 7% on the outside edge row of mature plantations. Considerable variation in flowering was found between locations (0-20% of trees reproductive) and 52% of plantations did not have compatible native species growing adjacent. Consequently, 65% of reproductive age plantations presented minimal or low risk of hybridisation due to lack of flowering and/or lack of adjacent compatible native species. Only three out of 10 surveyed high risk plantations were found to hybridise with native eucalypts (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, 0-3% hybrids in open-pollinated seed; Eucalyptus ovata, 0-2%). Established exotic E. ovata × globulus F1 hybrid seedlings were also identified at just one site, in response to disturbance from fire. The potential for gene flow from E. globulus plantations into native eucalypt populations does exist, however, the implementation of an outlined risk management framework would greatly reduce the likelihood. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Trees were assessed in the summer of 2005 for traits relating to attack, survival, gallery formation, and infection from the fungi associated with MPB, Ophiostoma sp. Successful initial attack was determined by the presence of dead (i.e., red or gray foliage) crowns and the presence of entrance holes from MPB. Eighty-seven percent of the trees still had green crowns in the fall of 2005 (GC05), with family mean differences ranging from 46 to 100%. The mean number of pitch tubes per tree (PT#05) (in a sampling area of 225 cm2 at breast height) was 1.5 with a range from 0 to 14 per tree. However, for pitch tubes indicating presence or absence (PTP05) of MPB on each tree, 63% of the trees had pitch tubes and family means ranged from 7 to 100%. Significant levels of genetic variation were found for GC05 and PTP05 with narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.20 (SE?=?0.11) and 0.26 (SE?=?0.07), respectively. Provenance differences were also significant, indicating that some population structure is present for these ""resistance"" attributes. The family breeding value correlations between 10-year height growth and PTP05 was 0.22, indicating that at the population level faster growing families may be slightly more subject to attack. An intensive survey of a subsample of 442 trees in the test (selected from 50 families with a range of attack levels) was conducted, and trees were reassessed for the presence of attack, presence of blue stain in the wood, and presence of galleries and egg chambers/eggs in the gallery. Family means ranged from 0 to 57% for blue stain, 11 to 63% for galleries, and 0 to 57% for egg chambers/eggs; however, due to the relatively small sample sizes and the nature of the binary data, family differences were not highly statistically significant. Further research is underway to improve the quantitative genetic parameters and determine the actual mechanisms at work; however, it is clear the MPB does react differently to host genotypes in terms of initial attack. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Antixenosis; Bark beetles; Correlations; Heritability; Pest resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949116267

A total of 24 necrotic root mutant lines were generated from a total of 24 independent reversion events at the w4-m locus. The initial mutable population included 4 mutable categories for w4-m, designated (1) low frequency of early excisions, (2) low frequency of late excisions, (3) high frequency of early excisions, and (4) high frequency of late excisions. These mutable categories were based upon flower phenotype, i.e., somatic tissue.

To evaluate possible risks associated with pollen-mediated transgene dispersal, we conducted a two-year survey in Vietnam to examine overlapping flowering periods of rice (Oryza sativa L.), weedy rice (O. sativa), and wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.), all of which are inter-fertile. We surveyed populations in two regions of the Mekong Delta, northern and southern, and at three sites in each of three habitats per region: fresh water, saline water, and acid sulfate soil. Weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously with neighboring cultivated rice plants. Flowering was more seasonal in wild rice and often peaked in November and December. Peak flowering times of wild rice overlapped with adjacent rice fields at all of the saline sites and half of the acid sulfate sites. The longer flowering season of wild rice ensured that crop-to-wild gene flow was possible in fresh water habitats as well. Our second objective was to determine whether wild and weedy rice populations are exposed to pests that could be targeted by future transgenes, which may then provide fitness benefits. These populations shared many pathogen and insect herbivore species with cultivated rice (leaffolder, locust, cricket, planthoppers, rice bug, stem borer, sheath blight, blast, bacterial leaf blight, and brown spot). Damage by leaffolders and locusts was the most frequently observed insect feeding damage on all three rice types. Indicator species analysis revealed that most of the insect herbivores were associated with particular habitats, demonstrating the importance of broad geographic sampling for transgenic rice risk assessment. These survey data and the strong likelihood of gene flow from cultivated rice suggest that further studies are needed to examine the effects of transgenic traits such as resistance to pests on the abundance of wild and weedy rice. © 2008 ISBR EDP Sciences.",Crop-wild gene flow; Diseases; Field survey; Genetically modified; Insect herbivores; Introgression; Oryza sativa; Risk assessment; Transgenic; Vietnam,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52649117497

We studied the mechanism of high temperature-induced grain sterility of different rice (Oryza sativa L) cultivars at two relative humidity (RH) levels. Four varieties of Indica and Japonica rice were exposed to over 85 % RH and 60 % RH at 36/30 °C, 34/30 °C, 32/24 °C and 30/24 °C day/night air temperatures from late booting to maturity inside sunlit phytotrons. Increasing both air temperature and RH significantly increased spikelet sterility while high temperature-induced sterility decreased significantly with decreasing RH. Neither Indica nor Japonica rice types were superior to the other in the response of their spikelets to increased air temperature and RH. Increased spikelet sterility was due to increased pollen grain sterility which reduced deposition of viable pollen grains on stigma. Reduction in sterility with decreased RH was more due to decreased spikelet temperature than to air temperature. Thus the impact of RH should be considered when interpreting the effect of high temperature on grain sterility. Spikelet fertility was curvilinearly related to spikelet temperature. Grain sterility increased when spikelet temperature increased over 30 °C while it became completely sterile at 36 °C. The ability of a variety to decrease its spikelet temperature with decreasing RH could be considered as avoidance while the variability in spikelet sterility among varieties at a given spikelet temperature could be considered as true tolerance. © 2008 The Authors.",Heat stress; High temperature; Pollination; Relative humidity; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40549128649

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments with gene-specific primers confirmed a predominant expression of Bt2 in endosperm, of Agpsemzm in embryo, and of Agpslzm in leaf, but also revealed considerable additional expression in various tissues for all three genes. Bt2a, the classical transcript coding for a cytoplasmic isoform, was almost exclusively expressed in the developing endosperm, whereas Bt2b, an alternative transcript coding for a plastidial isoform, was expressed in almost all tissues tested with a pattern very similar to that of Agpslzm. The phenotypic analysis showed that, at 30 d after pollination (DAP), mutant kernels were plumper than wild-type kernels, that the onset of kernel collapse took place between 31 and 35 DAP, and that the number of starch grains was greatly reduced in the mutant endosperm but not the mutant embryo. A comparative transcriptome analysis of wildtype and bt2-H2328 kernels at middevelopment (35 DAP) with the 18K GeneChip Maize Genome Array led to the conclusion that the lack of Bt2-encoded AGPase triggers large-scale changes on the transcriptional level that concern mainly genes involved in carbohydrate or amino acid metabolic pathways. Principal component analysis of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic profiles confirmed the impact of the bt2-H2328 mutation on these pathways and revealed that the bt2-H2328 mutation did not only affect the endosperm, but also the embryo at the metabolic level. These data suggest that, in the bt2-H2328 endosperms, regulatory networks are activated that redirect excess carbon into alternative biosynthetic pathways (amino acid synthesis) or into other tissues (embryo). © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48549086030

Organic farming did not show any significant effects on lepidopteran diversity. The results suggested that a successful conservation strategy for lepidopterans occurring in boreal agroecosystems depend on proper management of field boundaries, irrespective of farming regime. As bumblebee diversity tended to be higher at organic plots it is concluded that these important pollinators might be able to react on even small changes in habitat quality of cultivated lands.

Theoretical studies suggest that selfing is advantageous over outcrossing in terms of genetic transmission and assurance of seed production under pollenlimited circumstances. Trillium camschatcense is a herbaceous perennial distributed in Hokkaido and northern Honshu, Japan. Geographical variation in the breeding system (self-compatible, SC; or self-incompatible, SI) has been reported in populations in Hokkaido. Here, we used several SC and SI populations of T. camschatcense to investigate the adaptive significance and the evolutionary basis of self-fertilization. Pollination experiments and genetic analyses demonstrated that the potential availability of outcross pollen in SC populations was sufficient and that the number of pollen donors was equal to that of SI populations. However, despite the high availability of outcross pollen, the SC populations produced seeds predominantly by selfing and so underwent severe inbreeding depression. Although none of the suggested advantages for self-fertilization were supported by our analyses, we propose two possible scenarios for the evolution of self-fertilization in T. camschatcense.",Biparental inbreeding; Correlated paternity; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Pollen limitation; Reproductive assurance; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049092654

The main objective of this study was to investigate whether green leaf herbivory, having one of the most hazardous biotic impacts, would have any direct effect on the production and emission of floral volatiles because volatiles are known to play a crucial role in pollination. Nicotiana suaveolens plants were challenged with Manduca sexta feeding on leaves, and alterations in the quality and quantity of the floral blend, shifts in emission patterns, and changes in expression patterns of the floral benzoic/salicylic acid carboxyl-methyltransferase were monitored in noninfested and infested plants. Leaves responded to larval feeding by herbivory-induced diurnal emission of semiochemicals, whereas the emission of floral volatiles remained unchanged in comparison to the noninfested control. Neither the volatile composition nor the quantity of components or the nocturnal emission patterns was altered. The mRNA and protein levels of the benzoic/salicylic acid carboxylmethyltransferase, as well as its enzyme activity, also did not show any significant differences. These results indicate that metabolism in flowers at and postanthesis is an autonomous process and is independent of metabolic changes in green leaves. By this sustaining mechanism, N. suaveolens plants ensure sexual reproduction even under unfavorable conditions. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48549101964

Gene flow from transgenic crops to feral populations and naturalized compatible relatives has been raised as one of the main issues for the deregulation of transgenic events. Creeping bentgrass, Agrostis stolonifera L., is a perennial, outcrossing grass that propagates by seeds and stolons. Transgenic Roundup Ready® glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass (GRCB), which is currently under USDA-APHIS regulated status, was planted in 2002 on 162 ha within a production control area in Oregon, USA. 2. We conducted a study to assess transgene flow from the GRCB fields. A survey within and around the production control area was performed during the year when the GRCB fields produced seed and for 3 years after the fields were taken out of production. Transgene flow was determined by testing creeping bentgrass and its relatives for expression of the glyphosate resistance transgene. 3. While GRCB seed-production practices were strictly regulated, evidence of transgene flow was found in all years. In 2006, 3 years after the transgene source fields were taken out of production and a mitigation programme was initiated, 62% of the 585 creeping bentgrass plants tested in situ were glyphosate-resistant (GR). Our results document not only the movement of the glyphosate resistance transgene from the fields, but also the establishment and persistence of high frequencies of GR plants in the area, confirming that it was unrealistic to think that containment or eradication of GRCB could be accomplished. 4. Synthesis and applications: These findings highlight the potential for transgene escape and gene flow at a landscape level. The survey provides empirical frequencies that can be used to design monitoring and management methods for genetically engineered (GE) varieties of outcrossing, wind-pollinated, perennial grasses and to evaluate the potential for coexistence of GE and non-GE grass seed crops. Such information should also be used in the decision-making process for authorization of field trials and deregulation of genetic engineering events. © 2007 The Authors.",Agrostis; Coexistence of genetically engineered crops; CP4 EPSPS; Gene flow; Genetic engineering; Genetically modified crops; Glyphosate resistance; Glyphosate-resistant crops; Transgenic crops,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40949132598

Melocactus glaucescens, M. ernestii and M. xalbicephalus occur sympatrically in an area of ""caatinga""/ ""cerrado"" vegetation, and M. paucispinus in an area of ""cerrado""/""campo rupestre"". The superposition of flowering in these sympatric taxa was compared and analyzed. The phenology of M. paucispinus was correlated with both abiotic and biotic factors. Flowering of M. glaucescens and M. xalbicephalus were observed to be continuous (though with moderate peaks of activity), while fruiting was sub-annual. Melocactus ernestii exhibited an annual pattern of both flowering and fruiting; while in M. paucispinus the same patterns were sub-annual. These sympatric taxa showed 40% overlap of flowering periods, reaching to more than 50% in paired combinations of taxa, considering both the number of specimens flowering, as well as the quantity of resources being offered. Available information indicates that these taxa share pollinators, but phenological data rejects the hypothesis of shared pollinators and supports the hypothesis of hybridization in the study area. Rainfall was negatively correlated with flowering in M. paucispinus, but positively correlated with fruiting. Flowering of M. paucispinus in dry periods of the year avoids that erect flowers positioned in terminal cephalium, exposed in open areas of the vegetation, be damaged for the rains, while fruiting in rainy periods can be favorable to the dispersion and germination of this species.",Cactaceae; Hybridization; Melocactus; Phenology; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53849098425

The function's four parameters allowed both direct or indirect biological interpretation of germination behavior and the impact of seed pretreatments on germination improvement. Three parameters, a, b, and c, allowed direct assessment of germination capacity (%), the shape and steepness of the germination course, and germination speed (time to reach 50% germination). The fourth parameter y0 permitted estimation of the lag time (germination onset). The mathematical expression of cumulative seed germination of unstratified and stratified seed made it possible to quantitatively estimate seedlot dormancy and the amount of germination improvement caused by a specific seed pretreatment. This was accomplished by estimating the area between the two cumulative germination curves through integration. The utility of the proposed approach was demonstrated using germination data from wind-pollinated, individual genotypes (half-sib families) of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and bulk seedlots of lodgepole pine and white spruce (Picea glauca).

Individual palms were permanently marked with numbered aluminum tags and censused each month for the presence of ripe fruits. The dataset consisted of 1106 monthly observations of palms with ripe fruits among the 634 marked individuals. Mean densities of palms of reproductive size varied widely among islands, ranging from a low of 0.3 ha-1 for A. standleyanum and 3.5 ha-1 for A. butyracea to a high of 44.9 ha-1 for A. standleyanum and 33.7 ha-1 for A. butyracea.

The timing of fruiting by A. standleyanum was highly synchronous among islands, whereas inter-island synchrony in A. butyracea was less pronounced. The percentages of marked individuals that fruited varied widely among islands and years. Results indicated that these palms responded to both spatially and temporally variable conditions that promoted fruit production. We suggest that pollinator abundances are a crucial factor affecting reproductive output. Conditions that favor successful reproduction and seed dispersal, such as pollinator activity and the attraction of dispersal agents, may be the ultimate factors that have influenced the reproductive phenologies of these two species of palms. © 2008 The Authors.",Astrocaryum standleyanum; Attalea butyracea; Fruit production; Palms; Panama; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40149085576

The other HvCslF genes map to chromosomes 1H, 5H, and 7H, and in two cases the genes are close to other quantitative trait loci for grain (1,3;1,4)-?-D-glucan content. Spatial and temporal patterns of transcription of the seven genes have been defined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In developing barley coleoptiles HvCslF6 mRNA is most abundant. Transcript levels are maximal in 4- to 5-d coleoptiles, at a time when (1,3;1,4)-?-D-glucan content of coleoptile cell walls also reaches maximal levels. In the starchy endosperm of developing grain, HvCslF6 and HvCslF9 transcripts predominate. Two peaks of transcription are apparent. One occurs just after endosperm cellularization, 4 to 8 d after pollination, while the second occurs much later in grain development, more than 20 d after pollination. Marked varietal differences in transcription of the HvCslF genes are observed during endosperm development. Given the commercial importance of cereal (1,3;1,4)-?-D-glucans in human nutrition, in stock feed, and in malting and brewing, the observation that only two genes, HvCslF6 and HvCslF9, are transcribed at high levels in developing grain is of potential relevance for the future manipulation of grain (1,3;1,4)-?-D-glucan levels. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48549094244

O. Kuntze] is an important beverage crop in the world. In recent years many clonal tea cultivars have been released, and they play major roles in improving the production and quality of tea. It is important to understand the genetic diversity and relatedness of these cultivars to avoid inbreeding and narrow genetic basis in future tea breeding. In the present study, genetic diversity and relationship of 48 tea cultivars from China, Japan and Kenya were evaluated by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. A total of 382 ISSR bands were scored, of which 381 (99.7%) were polymorphic. The ISSR primers showed high ability to distinguish between tea cultivars according to their high Resolving Power (RP) with an average of 7.4. The mean of Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's information index (I) were 0.22 and 0.35, respectively. More abundant diversity was revealed among cultivars in China than those in Japan and Kenya. Within Chinese populations, the level of diversity in east China was higher than that in other regions. The coefficient of genetic differentiation (GST) was 0.202, which indicates a high degree of genetic variation within populations. This result was further confirmed by analysis of molecular variance, which revealed the variance component within the populations (92.07%) was obviously larger than that among populations (7.93%). The level of gene flow (Nm) was estimated to be 2.0. This could be explained by frequent natural cross-pollination and seed dispersal among tea populations. The pairwise similarity coefficient between the cultivars varied from 0.162 to 0.538. A dendrogram of 48 tea cultivars was constructed where all the tested cultivars were divided into two groups. Our data show that the genetic relationship among tea cultivars can be determined by the ISSR markers. This will provide valuable information to assist parental selection in current and future tea breeding programmes. © 2008 The Authors.",Camellia sinensis; Genetic diversity; Genetic relationship; Inter-simple sequence repeat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40849097789

The purpose of this study was to examine the functional consequences and conservation implications of protandry, andromonoecy, and mating patterns in the critically endangered and clonal plant, Ptilimnium nodosum. We conducted intra- and interfloral phenological observations to quantify opportunities for geitonogamy and calculated floral sex ratios of sequentially blooming umbel orders. We also provide information on P. nodosum's mating system. Flowers are self-compatible, but strong intrafloral protandry precludes autonomous selfing (< 1% seed set). Weak interfloral protandry combined with vegetative reproduction, however, provided multiple opportunities for geitonogamy which characteristically decreased with umbel order. Although low, mean seed set was comparable among open pollinated (25%), manually outcrossed (26%), and geitonogamously selfed (21%) pollination treatments, suggesting a mixed-mating system dependent on insect-mediated pollination. The significant decrease in mean seed set among higher umbel orders in open-pollinated plants is likely a consequence of low floral density and lack of pollinators late in the flowering season. Moderate reproductive output and high seed germinability suggest that environmental conditions, not mating system, regulate the distribution and abundance of P. nodosum and high immediate fitness gained by self-compatibility and vegetative reproduction plays a critical role to the species' short-term persistence. © Torrey Botanical Club.",Andromonoecy; Apiaceae; Asexual reproduction; Conservation; Endangered species; Mating systems; North Carolina; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77749317547

NBS profiling was first used to map resistance gene analogues (RGAs) in cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis), which simultaneously allowed the amplification and mapping of genetic markers anchored in the conserved NBS encoding domain of plant disease resistance genes. At the same time, the AFLP method was also performed in this paper to construct an intervarietal genetic map of cauliflower. A total of 234 AFLP markers and 21 NBS markers were mapped in an F2 population derived by self-pollinating a single F 1 plant (a hybrid between ""AD White Flower"" and ""C-8"") based on seventeen AFLP primer combinations and two degenerate primer/enzyme combinations. The markers were mapped into nine major linkage groups, spanning 668.4 cM, with an average distance of 2.9 cM between adjacent mapped markers. Each of the linkage groups contained from 12 to 47 loci, and the distance between two consecutive loci ranged from 0 to 14.9 cM. The AFLP markers were well distributed throughout the nine linkage groups, and eight linkage groups for the NBS markers. Most NBS markers mapped in this study were organized in clusters, indicating that most of them could be real RGAs.

It has been proposed that the restriction of ovary growth before pollination is because of the stamens acting as negative regulators. Accordingly, the silencing of genes responsible for stamen identity has been correlated with parthenocarpy in different species. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) parthenocarpic fruit (pat) mutation associates autonomous ovary development with homeotic transformation of the anthers and aberrancy of ovules in the ovary. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that stamen aberrations and parthenocarpy in pat are driven by cues coming from the altered expression of class B MADS box genes. The data showed that the Pat locus is not allelic to either of the two tomato mutations putatively involved in the B function, stamenless (sl)-2 and pistillate (pi) or to genes encoding class B transcription factors. Whereas pat pi double mutants were not recovered because of tight linkage, pat sl-2 double mutants showed mainly epistatic effects. The developmental regulation of the Sl DEFICIENS (DEF) gene in the wild-type (WT) at anthesis as well as its differential transcription in the pat ovary suggest that it plays a role in the control of ovary growth. Accordingly, when compared with the WT, the gene was also differentially expressed in the parthenocarpic fruit-2 (pat-2) mutant, that is not allelic to pat and has normal ovule development. Altogether the results indicate that in tomato SlDEF plays a role in the control of ovary growth and that the pat mutation is located upstream of this regulatory cascade. © Physiologia Plantarum 2007.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40549128403

The azonal halophilous vegetation, mostly distributed in the lowland or near the lake shore, leads to higher than average percentages of Chenopodiaceae pollen. Signal of exotic Pinus pollen is also strengthened in the lowland and lake sediment. 4) Human disturbance: The role of human disturbance on surface pollen assemblages is weak, as shown in the Mu Us Sandland. This study also provides theoretical bases for quantitative reconstructions of palaeoclimate and palaeovegetation based on fossil pollen spectra from lake sediments and lowland soils in the semi-arid East Asian steppe. We suggest that calibration against locally dispersed pollen taxa is necessary to reliably reconstruct changes in vegetation pattern through time, for example, a factor of 1.75 for the widely used A/C (Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae) ratio is suggested according to the pollen assemblages in the surface layers of the lake sediment vs. slope soil in Anguli Nuur.

Physical interactions between starch branching enzymes (SBEs) and starch synthases (SSs) were identified from endosperm amyloplasts during the active phase of starch deposition in the developing grain using immunoprecipitation and cross-linking strategies. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using peptide-specific antibodies indicate that at least two distinct complexes exist containing SSI, SSIIa, and either of SBEIIa or SBEIIb. Chemical cross linking was used to identify protein complexes containing SBEs and SSs from amyloplast extracts. Separation of extracts by gel filtration chromatography demonstrated the presence of SBE and SS forms in protein complexes of around 260 kD and that SBEII forms may also exist as homodimers. Analysis of cross-linked 260-kD aggregation products from amyloplast lysates by mass spectrometry confirmed SSI, SSIIa, and SBEII forms as components of one or more protein complexes in amyloplasts. In vitro phosphorylation experiments with ?-32P-ATP indicated that SSII and both forms of SBEII are phosphorylated. Treatment of the partially purified 260-kD SS-SBE complexes with alkaline phosphatase caused dissociation of the assembly into the respective monomeric proteins, indicating that formation of SS-SBE complexes is phosphorylation dependent. The 260-kD SS-SBEII protein complexes are formed around 10 to 15 d after pollination and were shown to be catalytically active with respect to both SS and SBE activities. Prior to this developmental stage, SSI, SSII, and SBEII forms were detectable only in monomeric form. High molecular weight forms of SBEII demonstrated a higher affinity for in vitro glucan substrates than monomers.

Here, we analysed nine microsatellite loci for 218 adults and 325 progeny of the tree Dipteryx panamensis in Costa Rica. Pollen dispersal distances, genetic diversity, genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation were determined for populations in four habitats: continuous forest, forest fragments, pastures adjacent to fragments and isolated pastures. We predicted longer but less frequent pollen movements among increasingly isolated trees. This pattern would lead to lower outcrossing rates for pasture trees, as well as lower genetic diversity and increased structure and spatial autocorrelation among their progeny. Results generally followed these expectations, with the shortest pollen dispersal among continuous forest trees (240 m), moderate distances for fragment (343 m) and adjacent pasture (317 m) populations, and distances of up to 2.3 km in isolated pastures (mean: 557 m). Variance around pollen dispersal estimates also increased with fragmentation, suggesting altered pollination conditions. Outcrossing rates were lower for pasture trees and we found greater spatial autocorrelation and genetic structure among their progeny, as well as a trend towards lower heterozygosity. Paternal reproductive dominance, the pollen contributions from individual fathers, did not vary among habitats, but we did document asymmetric pollen flow between pasture and adjacent fragment populations. We conclude that long-distance pollen dispersal helps maintain gene flow for D. panamensis in this fragmented landscape, but pasture and isolated pasture populations are still at risk of long-term genetic erosion. © 2008 The Authors.",Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Paternal reproductive dominance; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42049094877

Bee communities in ruderal areas were significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie remnants, with about half as many species and approximately a third as many bees. Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies, indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition of the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones.

This structure is often assumed to be particular to mutualistic interactions in opposition to the compartmentalized pattern expected for antagonistic networks. We investigated the presence of asymmetric specialization in a data set assembled from the literature of 20 highly resolved plant-insect herbivore networks and compared them with 24 plant-pollinator networks. Our results indicate that these two types of networks differ, but not in the way it is generally assumed. Asymmetric specialization is present in plant-herbivore networks even if it appears less frequently than in plant-pollinator networks. Indeed, mean and median percentages of species showing asymmetric specialisation in herbivory webs are 33% and 14% respectively, compared to 57% and 60% in pollination webs. Furthermore, the amount of asymmetry is linked with species diversity and not to connectance in plant-pollinator networks whereas the opposite pattern is found in plant-herbivore networks. Our results offer promising perspectives for understanding both the mechanisms that structure ecological communities and their impact on community dynamics depending on the type of interaction. © 2008 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149088954

In insect-pollinated plants, floral traits are expected to play an important role determining pollen-mediated gene flow variation. The aim of this study was to identify floral traits associated with interplot gene flow that could be used as effective predictors of gene flow potential to improve between-plot isolation strategies in the field for seed multiplication. The isolation strategies tested were a barren zone, two trap crops, a faba bean male sterile variety and a tetraploid genotype and a non-pollinated crop, a Vicia narbonensis population. Four genotypes, fixed for alternative isozyme alleles allowed identification of between-plot hybrids through progeny testing. G-test was used to analyse the independence of isolation zone and genotype. Principal component analysis was used to obtain information on the usefulness of faba bean traps as barriers to prevent interplot gene flow. Paternity analysis in conjunction with multiple regression allowed the determination of floral traits that accounted for the largest proportion of variation in pollen-mediated gene flow across each of the four isolation strategies. The floral traits studied were grouped into functional categories and were used as independent variables with gene flow as the dependent variable in a forward stepwise multiple regression procedure. There were large variations in gene flow level and patterns among the genotypes. It was shown that gene flow was isolation zone and genotype dependent. Multivariate regression models showed that differences in floral traits accounted for more than 70% of the variation in interplot gene flow. The relative importance of various floral traits depends on the isolation zone. Flower advertisement appeared important in predicting gene flow in plots surrounded by a barren zone. With regard to plots surrounded by a V. narbonensis population, the role of a reward trait, pollen production, was established. In contrast, in plots surrounded by faba bean trap crops, ovary length played the most important and consistent role in accounting for variation in gene flow. Our results show that interplot gene flow is largely dependent on floral traits, and thus confirm the utility of floral traits for generating hypotheses about cultivar outcrossing or inbreeding behaviour. Thus, it could help to devise more efficient procedures for seed multiplication. © 2007 The Authors.",Faba bean; Floral traits; Gene flow; Isolation strategies; Seed multiplication,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149177387

Recent studies have shown that the mutated acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene that confers resistance to imazethapyr (Newpath) herbicide can be transferred from Clearfield rice cultivars via cross pollination under field conditions to weedy red rice. Resistance of commercial Clearfield rice cultivars to imazethapyr is due to the presence of two point mutations in the ALS gene that result in amino acid substitutions from serine to asparagine (S to D) and glycine to glutamic acid (G to E). We report here development of a DNA-based method that involves application of allele-specific PCR assays to distinguish herbicide-susceptible and resistant ALS alleles in either homozygous or heterozygous genotypes produced from natural outcrosses between Clearfield varieties CL121, CL141, CL161 and weedy red rice. PCR assays that can distinguish between the homozygous and heterozygous imazethapyr-resistant S 653D and G654E SNP alleles of the rice ALS gene were developed and evaluated. A total of 483 individual red rice plants were successfully screened for the presence of S653D SNP and another 145 F2 individuals from natural red rice x CL121 hybridizations were screened for the presence of the G654E SNP. The PCR-based assays produced during this study are simple, rapid, inexpensive, reproducible and require only standard PCR and electrophoretic instruments that can be applied toward outcrossing evaluation and effective weed management strategies for the Clearfield crop system. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Allele-specific PCR; Clearfield; Herbicide resistance; Imazethapyr imidazolinone; Newpath herbicide; Outcrossing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41049111744

(syn. Dasypyrum villosum Candargy, 2n=14, VV) has been proved to be an important genetic resource for wheat improvement. The development of translocation with small alien chromosome segments, especially interstitial translocation, will be helpful for better utilization of its useful genes. Up to now, most of the reported Triticum aestivum-H. villosa translocation lines are involved in a whole arm or large alien fragments. In this paper, we report a highly efficient approach for the creation of small chromosome segment translocation lines. Before flowering, the female gametes of wheat-H. villosa 6VS/6AL translocation line were irradiated by 60CO-? ray at 160 Rad/M dosage rate and three dosages (1600, 1920, 2240 Rad). Anthers were removed from the irradiated florets on the same day and the florets were pollinated with normal fresh pollens of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring after 2 - 3 days. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) at mitosis metaphase of root-tip cell of M1 plants was used to detect the chromosome structural changes involving 6VS of H. villosa. Among the 534 M1 plants screened, 97 plants contained small segment chromosome structural changes of 6VS, including 80 interstitial translocation chromosomes, 57 terminal translocation chromosomes and 55 deletion chromosomes. For the 2240 Rad dosage treatment, the inducement frequencies of interstitial translocation, terminal translocation and deletion were 21.02%, 14.01%, and 14.65%, respectively, which were much higher than those previously reported. The M 2 seeds were obtained by backcrossing of 74 M1 plants involving 146 chromosomes structural changes of 6VS, and it was found that the structural aberrations in the M1 plants could be transmitted to their progenies. Irradiating mature female gametes of whole arm translocation is a new and highly efficient approach for creation of small segment chromosome structural changes, especially for interstitial translocations. © 2008 Science Press.",Genomic in situ hybridization; Haynaldia villosa; Irradiation; Mature female gametes; Small fragment translocation chromosome; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43349089872

However, pollination with the pollinia of cv. Karen or cv. Kenny flowers did not produce these effects. We compared these two cultivars with cvv. Pompadour, Willie and Sakura, and tested the hypotheses that the differences were related to levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the pollinia, ethylene production by the pollinated flower, pollen germination, or pollen tube growth. The pollinia of cvv. Karen and Kenny contained as much ACC as the pollinia of cv. Pompadour, but less than the pollinia of cvv. Willie and Sakura. Ethylene production after pollination with cvv. Karen and Kenny pollinia was much lower than after pollination with pollinia from the other cultivars tested. The pollen grains showed normal germination, but cvv. Karen and Kenny pollen grains exhibited much less tube growth than those of the other cultivars. Pollen tube growth in cv. Pompadour was positively affected by ethylene. Ethylene was required and sufficient for the induction of epinasty, rapid perianth colour changes and early perianth senescence, very similar to the changes after pollination. The absence of these effects after pollination with cvv. Kenny and Karen seems to be due to the low ethylene production induced by the pollinia of these cultivars.

Pollinators such as western wattlebirds, New Holland honeyeaters and western spinebills almost exclusively visit flowers or inflorescences at times when large amounts of nectar are present, and when self-pollen is available for transfer or stigmas are receptive to the deposition of pollen. By foraging in this manner, yet still moving frequently between plants and inflorescences, honeyeaters that visit D. sessilis should guarantee an effective spread of pollen. The overall level of fruiting success achieved by this species is considerably higher than that for G. wilsonii, a species whose flowers are visited much less often than those of D. sessilis. Allozyme analysis, artificial pollination experiments and the calculation of pollen : ovule ratios indicate that D. sessilis is essentially an obligate outcrosser, at least in locations where plant densities are high, whereas G. wilsonii has a mixed mating system that allows it to set fruits as a consequence of either selfing or outcrossing. Potential fruit-set is low for both species, with post-zygotic incompatibility mechanisms mediated by the availability of nutritional resources thought to be at least partly responsible for the even lower levels of final fruit-set. Total fruit and seed production by individual plants is much greater for D. sessilis than for G. wilsonii, and possibly a reflection of differences in the regeneration requirements of the two species after environmental disturbance such as fire. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40949115874

Mudd Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States","Typically, animal pollinators are attracted to flowers by sensory stimuli in the form of pigments, volatiles, and cuticular substances (hairs, waxes) derived from plant secondary metabolism. Few studies have addressed the extent to which primary plant metabolites, such as respiratory carbon dioxide (CO 2), may function as pollinator attractants. Night-blooming flowers of Datura wrightii show transient emissions of up to 200 ppm above-ambient CO 2 at anthesis, when nectar rewards are richest. Their main hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta, can perceive minute variation (0.5 ppm) in CO 2 concentration through labial pit organs whose receptor neurons project afferents to the antennal lobe. We explored the behavioral responses of M. sexta to artificial flowers with different combinations of CO2, visual, and olfactory stimuli using a laminar flow wind tunnel. Responses in no-choice assays were scale-dependent; CO2 functioned as an olfactory distance-attractant redundant to floral scent, as each stimulus elicited upwind tracking flights. However, CO2 played no role in probing behavior at the flower. Male moths showed significant bias in first-approach and probing choice of scented flowers with above-ambient CO2 over those with ambient CO2, whereas females showed similar bias only in the presence of host plant (tomato) leaf volatiles. Nevertheless, all males and females probed both flowers regardless of their first choice. While floral CO 2 unequivocally affects male appetitive responses, the context-dependence of female responses suggests that they may use floral CO 2 as a distance indicator of host plant quality during mixed feeding-oviposition bouts on Datura and Nicotiana plants. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Fragrance; Odor; Olfaction; Pollination; Sphingidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449125721

Within the astonishing diversity of orchid pollination systems, sexual deception is one of the most stunning. An example is the genus Ophrys, where plants attract male bees as pollinators by mimicking female mating signals. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) are often the key signal for this chemical mimicry. Here we investigate the evolution of these key compounds within Orchidinae by mapping their production in flowers of selected species onto their estimated phylogeny. Results. We found that alkenes, at least in trace amounts, were present in 18 of 20 investigated species together representing 10 genera. Thus, the reconstruction of ancestral state for alkene-production showed that this is a primitive character state in Ophrys, and can be interpreted as a preadaptation for the evolution of sexual deception. Four of the investigated species, namely Ophrys sphegodes, Serapias lingua, S. cordigera, and Anacamptis papilionacea, that are pollinated primarily by male bees, produced significantly larger amounts and a greater number of different alkenes than the species pollinated either primarily by female bees or other insects. Conclusion. We suggest that high amounts of alkenes evolved for the attraction of primarily male bees as pollinators by sensory exploitation, and discuss possible driving forces for the evolution of pollination by male bees. © 2008 Schiestl and Cozzolino; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40849135763

However, the unintended spreading of commercial transgenic crops by pollination and seed dispersal is a major concern for environmental and food safety. Simple and reliable containment strategies for transgenes are highly desirable. Here we report a novel method for creating selectively terminable transgenic rice. In this method, the gene(s) of interest is tagged with a RNA interference cassette which specifically suppresses the expression of the bentazon detoxification enzyme CYP81A6 and this renders transgenic rice to be sensitive to bentazon, a herbicide used for rice weed control. We generated transgenic rice plants by this method using a new glyposate resistants 5-enolpyruvyishikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene from Pesudomonas putida as the gene of interest, and demonstrated that these transgenic rice plants were highly sensitive to bentazon but tolerant to glyphosate, which is exactly the opposite of conventional rice. Field trial of these transgenic rice plants further confirmed that they can be selectively killed at 100% by one spray of bentazon at a regular dose used for conventional rice weed control. Furthermore, we found that the terminable transgenic rice created in this study shows no difference in growth, development and yield compared ti its non-transgenic control. Therefore, this method of creating transgenic rice constitutes a novel strategy of transgene containment, which appears simple, reliable and inexpensive for implementation. © 2008 Lin et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-46649090325

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between kernel development and nutritive value of maize silage, using controlled pollination to alter the extent of ear fill in 4 maize hybrids. Whole-plant acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and crude protein (CP) were measured. Pollination control affected the ear fill for 0% and 100% pollination levels. Stem diameter and plant height were not affected by pollination treatment; however, they were different for the hybrids. Leaf content and stalk content were negatively correlated (r = -0.68** and -0.87** respectively) with actual ear fill. Ear content was also positively correlated with dry matter (DM) yield (r = 0.69**) and was negatively correlated with ADF (r = -0.73**) and NDF (r = -0.73**). Harvest index varied among pollination treatments and the hybrids. The greatest DM yield (17.8 Mg ha-1) obtained at 100% pollination level. Whole-plant DM content increased by 19% as pollination level increased from 0% to 100%. DM content was positively correlated with grain yield (r = 0.80**) and ear content (r = 0.81**) and it was negatively correlated with leaf content (r = -0.63**) and stalk content (r = -0.77**). Whole-plant NDF (r = -0.81**) and ADF (r = -0.75**) were negatively correlated with pollination levels or actual ear fill.

The results revealed that ear fill and kernel development are important factors in decreasing whole-plant NDF and ADF values. © TÜB?TAK.",Acid detergent fiber; Agronomic characters; Crude protein; Dry matter yield; Neutral detergent fiber; Pollination; Silage maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40549100042

In all, 183 flowers of Aristolochia pallida Willd. were investigated, which in total contained 73 arthropods, dominated by two groups of Diptera, black fungus gnats (Sciaridae representing 37%) and scuttle flies (Phoridae representing 19%), respectively. However, only Phoridae are regarded as potential pollinators, since pollen has been found exclusively on the body of these insects. All Phoridae belong to the genus Megaselia and are recognised as three morpho-species. The measurements of flower and insect dimensions suggest that size is an important constraint for successful pollination: (a) the insects must have a definitive size for being able to enter the flower and (b) must be able to get in touch with the pollen. Only very few insect groups found in A. pallida fulfil these size requirements. However, size alone is not a sufficient filter as too many fly species of the same size might be trapped but not function as pollinators. Instead, specific attraction is required as otherwise pollen is lost. Since all trapped Phoridae are males, a chemical attraction (pheromones) is proposed as an additional constraint. Since the flowers are protogynous, the record of Megaselia loaded with pollen found in a flower during its female stage proves that this insect must have had visited at least one different flower during its male stage before. Further on, this observation provides strong evidence that the flowers are cross-pollinated. All these factors indicate a highly specialised pollination of A. pallida by Megaselia species. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Differentiation among provenances was found only for relative height growth rate (RHGR). The total years of apical attack by Hypsipyla grandella varied by a magnitude of 100% among families but showed little heritability. After 4 years, mean height per family ranged from 328 to 564 cm, 160 to 381 cm, and 253 to 390 cm at each site. Although heritabilities for height were too low for cross-site selection, sufficient heritability (hI2 = 0.26), additive genetic coefficients of variation (AGCV = 22%), and type B genetic correlations (rb(f) = 0.74) for RHGR across the two sites with poorer growth indicated that this trait might be used as a surrogate.

At the site with better growth, there was sufficient heritability (hI2 = 0.31) and AGCV (20%) for height at year 5 to obtain an estimated gain of 15% for the best 15% of trees.

Seldom, however, can patterns of flower abundance and visitation in the field be linked with the behavioral mechanisms that allow floral visitors to persist when a preferred resource is scarce. To explore these mechanisms better, we examined factors controlling floral preference in the hawk-moth Manduca sexta in the semiarid grassland of Arizona. Here, hawkmoths forage primarily on flowers of the bat-adapted agave, Agave palmeri, but shift to the moth-adapted flowers of their larval host plant, Datura wrightii, when these become abundant. Both plants emit similar concentrations of floral odor, but scent composition, nectar, and flower reflectance are distinct between the two species, and A. palmeri flowers provide six times as much chemical energy as flowers of D. wrightii. Behavioral experiments with both naïve and experienced moths revealed that hawkmoths learn to feed from agave flowers through olfactory conditioning but readily switch to D. wrightii flowers, for which they are the primary pollinator, based on an innate odor preference. Behavioral flexibility and the olfactory contrast between flowers permit the hawkmoths to persist within a dynamic environment, while at the same time to function as the major pollinator of one plant species. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Flower visitation; Foraging behavior; Moth; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149175489

In this study, we show that landscapes composed of higher proportions of organic crop fields support more bee species at greater abundances in fallow strips. An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5% to 20% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50%, density of solitary bees by 60% and bumble bee density by 150%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields.

Few studies have investigated how variable pollinators are in a generalist pollination system or how this variation affects plant reproduction. We investigated the degree of variation in pollinators and resulting reproductive success among populations of a widespread generalist-pollinated herb, Trachymene incisa (Apiaceae). The European honeybee was unexpectedly absent from the pollinator assemblages, providing the unique opportunity to study the native Australian pollinators. Insect visitation rates and the taxonomic composition of the pollinator assemblage varied significantly across populations, indicating that populations of T. incisa are not equally serviced and are not equally generalist. This highlights that sampling one population would not characterize the extent of species generalization. There was no positive correlation between insect visitation rate and reproductive success, with the Agnes Banks population receiving the highest visitation rate but producing the lowest reproductive output, and the Myall Lakes population receiving the lowest visitation rate and producing the highest seedling emergence. This study shows that variation in pollinators can have measurable effects on populations of generalist-pollinated plants, therefore there is potential for large-scale change in all plant-pollinator interactions. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Apiales; Insect pollination; Pollinator assemblage; Seed production; Seedling emergence; Spatial variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39749167338

Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall ovules in their ""fruits"" (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules. © 2008 Dunn et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749105954

The chromosome number of this species was found to be 2n=38. The pollinator for this new species was Micraphis andreniformis Smith that carried the pollinia of Holcoglossum nujiangense on its head. The visiting behavior of the pollinator is food-search kind, although there is no obvious nectar in the spur. © 2007 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049126825

E. secundum flowers all year round, with a flowering peak between September and January. This species is either a lithophytic or terrestrial herb in the SJ, whereas, in Picinguaba, it grows mainly in disturbed areas along roadsides. E. secundum is pollinated by several species of diurnal Lepidoptera at both study sites. In Picinguaba, where E. secundum is sympatric with E. fulgens and both share the same pollinators, pollen transference between these two species was recorded. E. secundum is self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. It is inter-compatible with E. fulgens, producing fertile seeds. In contrast to the population of the SJ, in the Picinguaba region, floral morphology is quite variable among plants and some individuals present flowers with characteristics in-between both sympatric species, suggesting that natural hybridization occasionally occurs. The anthropogenic perturbation is probably the cause of the occurrence of E. secundum in the Picinguaba region, enabling its contact with E. fulgens. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Epidendroideae; Epidendrum; Laeliinae; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41849104202

We address three types of plant-pollinator interactions - filtering, facilitation and competitive exclusion - and their predicted impacts on communities. The few available studies that address how pollinator-mediated interactions limit or promote plant species establishment and persistence provide support for many of these predictions.

Light level can directly affect plant reproductive success through resource availability or by altering pollinator behavior. It can also indirectly influence reproductive success by determining floral display size which may in turn influence pollinator attraction. We evaluated direct and indirect effects of light availability and measured phenotypic selection on phenological traits that may enhance pollen receipt in the insect-pollinated herb Campanulastrum americanum. In a natural population, plants in the sun had larger displays and received 7 times more visits than plants in the shade. Using experimental arrays to separate the direct effects of irradiance on insects from their response to display size, we found more visits to plants in the sun than in the shade, but no association between number of visits each flower received and display size. Plants in the sun were not pollen limited but pollen-augmented shade flowers produced 50% more seeds than open-pollinated flowers. Phenological traits, which may influence pollen receipt, were not under direct selection in the sun. However, earlier initiation and a longer duration of flowering were favored in the shade, which may enhance visitation in this pollen-limited habitat. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Light availability; Phenotypic selection; Pollen limitation; Pollinator behavior; Reproductive phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39249085859

Semicompatible pollination arises when only one allele of a pollen parent matches the pistil. Semicompatible test-crosses using partially S-genotyped european pear cultivars allowed the discrimination of 14 S-alleles (S1 to S14) at the phenotypic level and the assignment of 33 cultivars to 13 incompatibility groups. Partial genomic sequences of the S-RNase gene, spanning between the C1 and C5 conserved regions, were obtained for each new S-allele identified (S 6 to S14). These sequences and those reported previously for the S1 to S5 RNases allowed a set of consensus primers amplifying all 14 S-RNase alleles to be designed. Allele-specific PCR allowed discrimination between those S-RNases giving amplification products of similar size with consensus primers. These two approaches provided a method for the molecular identification of all 14 S-alleles in european pear. With this methodology, we demonstrate that the S-RNase genotypes inferred from PCR exactly matches the S-phenotypes deduced from test-crosses.

Heavy metal components associated with air pollutants have far reaching effects with respect to economic and ecological importance of pollens. The pollens are male reproductive organs of the plant and travel through air from flower to flower for pollination purpose. During this period they are exposed to air pollutants. Present investigation thus pertains to study of effect of air pollutants on pollens especially biosorption and bioaccumulation of heavy metals. The pollens of three commonly occurring plants namely Cassia siamea, Cyperus rotundus, Kigelia pinnata have been studied from the NH-6 of Nagpur city, India. The pollens exposed to polluted air showed the presence of higher concentrations of Ca, Al and Fe as compared to unexposed pollens. Higher concentration of these metals was observed in Cyperus rotundus followed by Cassia siamea and Kigelia pinnata. These results indicate that pollens act as good indicator of air pollution giving results in short time of exposure of 5-10 h. Apart from this, it is also reported that some of these metals play crucial role in the metabolic activity in pollens for example Calcium is necessary for growth of pollen tube and other metabolic activities in pollens. The presence of these metals in pollens may also enhance the allergenicity of the pollens. Similarly accumulation of heavy metals may also deteriorate the quality of pollen for their economical use. The viability of pollen is also affected by these pollutants in sensitive species leading to impairment of their fertility. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.",Air pollutants; Allergenicity; Bioaccumulation; Metals; Pollens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049170585

We also performed self- and cross-pollinations within and among source groups. North American collections differed from European collections for 12 of the 18 morphologic variables. 'Appar' collections were morphologically similar to European collections and differed from North American collections for 13 of the 18 variables.

Understanding human-induced modifications in ecosystem processes such as seed predation is essential for conservation management of threatened species. We studied the impact of forest fragmentation and selective logging on seed predation of the endangered tree Prunus africana in the tropical rain forest of Kakamega, Kenya. We quantified the activity of seed predators in the main forest, forest fragments, and in sites of different logging intensity in the dry and rainy seasons of 2003 and 2006. Further, we performed predation experiments with single and groups of P. africana seeds in the same sites. We recorded a tendency toward higher activity of seed predators in the main forest compared to fragmented sites. Single seeds, in contrast to groups of seeds, had marginally significantly higher predation rates in intensively logged compared to moderately logged sites. Overall, predation rates showed little relationship to seed predator activity and were highly variable among years and seasons. Additional studies on seedling establishment and survival are needed to predict whether the endangered tree is able to maintain sustainable populations in Kakamega Forest. Only by studying all processes in the life cycle is it possible to develop sound management strategies for the species. © 2008 The Author(s).",Human impact; Kakamega Forest; Kenya; Plant-animal interaction; Small mammals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549158273

Physiological studies have established that ethylene and auxin contribute to cell separation control. Genetic analyses of abscission mutants have defined ethylene-independent detachment regulators. Functional genomic strategies leading to global understandings of abscission have awaited methods for isolating AZ cells of low abundance and very small size. Here, we couple laser capture microdissection of Arabidopsis thaliana stamen AZs and GeneChip profiling to reveal the AZ transcriptome responding to a developmental shedding cue. Analyses focus on 551 AZ genes (AZ551) regulated at the highest statistical significance (P ? 0.0001) over five floral stages linking prepollination to stamen shed. AZ551 includes mediators of ethylene and auxin signaling as well as receptor-like kinases and extracellular ligands thought to act independent of ethylene. We hypothesized that novel abscission regulators might reside in disproportionately represented Gene Ontology Consortium functional categories for cell wall modifying proteins, extracellular regulators, and nuclear-residing transcription factors. Promoter-?- glucuronidase expression of one transcription factor candidate, ZINC FINGER PROTEIN2 (AtZFP2), was elevated in stamen, petal, and sepal AZs. Flower parts of transgenic lines overexpressing AtZFP2 exhibited asynchronous and delayed abscission. Abscission defects were accompanied by altered floral morphology limiting pollination and fertility. Hand-pollination restored transgenic fruit development but not the rapid abscission seen in wild-type plants, demonstrating that pollination does not assure normal rates of detachment. In wild-type stamen AZs, AtZFP2 is significantly up-regulated postanthesis. Phenotype data from transgene overexpression studies suggest that AtZFP2 participates in processes that directly or indirectly influence organ shed. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48949107734

Small and low-density populations often suffer significant reductions in reproduction, as exemplified by studies on rare and threatened species. While this phenomenon is less studied in common species, if general, it should not be restricted to those in peril. We addressed this assertion by examining the effects of plant abundance, measured at population-level (population size, density) and local-level (local neighbourhood size, LNS) spatial scales, on fruit set, seed set and subsequent reproductive success (RS) across 19 natural populations of the widespread biennial Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae). We also examined stigmatic pollen loads across a subset of populations to address whether changes in reproduction were related to reduced pollination. 2. Effects of plant abundance on reproduction were evident at both spatial scales. At the population level, population size - but not density - affected fruit set significantly. This effect was non-linear. Fruit set in populations larger than 15 individuals was relatively constant, but dropped abruptly in populations below that size. This relationship did not prevail between population size and RS. Instead, RS declined significantly with population density. 3. At the local level, increases in LNS between 1-m and 4-m radii from study plants increased fruit set significantly. In contrast, increases within 1 m significantly reduced seed set. Both of these effects prevailed at different spatial scales for RS; increases in 1-m LNS reduced RS, but increases beyond that distance and within 4 m increased RS. 4. Although non-significant, trends in the data are consistent with facilitative interactions for pollination influencing local-level effects on fruit set. However, negative interactions, presumably because of competition for resources, are more important for determining seed set at local scales. Both interactions influence RS, but the effect of competition appears to dominate at the population level. 5. Synthesis. This study demonstrates that although significant reductions in fruit set in small S. angularis populations imply that common species are not impervious to reproductive disadvantages, small populations need not experience reduced RS. Furthermore, low-density populations actually enjoy increased RS. As such, this study highlights the complexity of ecological interactions affecting reproduction and the importance of incorporating multiple spatial scales when examining population dynamics. © 2007 The Authors.",Competition; Density; Facilitation; Fruit set; Local neighbourhood size; Pollen load; Population size; Reproductive success; Sabatia angularis; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849179472

Both males and females of this species are good potential pollinators from a behavioural standpoint.

Individuals were abundant and formed the majority of insect visitors to G. robertianum flowers. Males and females differed in their flower-visiting behaviour, with females visiting more individual flowers and doing so more slowly than males. This difference between the sexes appears to relate to mating behaviour, which takes place within the flower patches.

We use glasshouse and field experiments to examine the benefits of autonomous and facilitated selfing in Bulbine vagans. Autonomous selfing was delayed until after opportunities for outcrossing and reproductive output was 0.67 relative to manual selfing and open pollination. Values less than one probably reflected insufficient autonomous deposition of self pollen. In the field, reproductive output of emasculated flowers was 0.50 relative to intact flowers that could both outcross and self, indicating that outcross pollen was limited and that selfing boosted reproductive output. Because all pollen was removed from anthers before intact flowers closed, facilitated selfing rather than autonomous selfing occurred. In the glasshouse, inbreeding depression was 0.45, but under natural conditions would probably exceed 0.5. Values greater than 0.5 negate the automatic gene transmission advantage afforded by selfing and increasingly erode the benefits of reproductive assurance.

Here, we investigated three components of postzygotic isolation - embryo mortality, hybrid inviability, and hybrid sterility - in a group of food-deceptive Mediterranean orchids from the genera Anacamptis, Neotinea, and Orchis. In these orchids, pollinator-mediated isolation is weak, which suggests that postpollination barriers exist. Based on crossing experiments and a literature survey, we found that embryo mortality caused complete reproductive isolation among 36.3% of the species pairs, and hybrid inviability affected 55.6% of the potentially hybridizing species pairs. Hybrid sterility was assessed experimentally for seven species pairs. A strong reduction of fertility in all investigated hybrids was found, together with clear differences between male and female components of hybrid sterility. Postzygotic isolation was found to evolve gradually with genetic divergence, and late postzygotic isolation (i.e., hybrid inviability and sterility) evolved faster than embryo mortality, which is an earlier postzygotic isolation stage. These results reveal that intrinsic postzygotic isolation strongly contributes to maintaining species boundaries among Mediterranean food-deceptive orchids while establishing a prominent role for these reproductive barriers in the early stage of species isolation. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

By performing single- and mixed-donor pollinations, we show that soil Ca alters the outcome of interspecific pollen competition in the annual Phlox hybrid system of Phlox cuspidata and P. drummondii. In the absence of interspecific pollen competition, heterospecific pollen siring success of both species was influenced most strongly by the maternal growth environment, such that hybridization was facilitated when heterospecific pollen was deposited on stigmas of maternal plants growing in high Ca soils. When heterospecific pollen was forced to compete against conspecific pollen, however, the maternal growth environment did not influence hybridization, but the environmental origin of heterospecific pollen did, and this effect depended on the maternal species. Pollen of P. drummondii was more effective at outcompeting P. cuspidata pollen and preventing hybridization in P. drummondii dams when P. cuspidata pollen was derived from low Ca. Pollen competition within pistils of P. cuspidata was unaffected by pollen Ca environment. In situations in which P. cuspidata grows in lower soil Ca than P. drummondii, as has been documented in one population, these results suggest that the competitive ability of heterospecific pollen will be diminished by environmental effects of soil Ca. Thus, the environment in which pollen develops can influence interspecific pollen competition and hybridization frequency. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Hybridization; Interspecific pollen competition; Population differentiation; Post-pollination pollen performance; Reproductive isolation; Soil calcium environment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049113861

Pollen limitation may result from the breakdown of once-continuous habitat into smaller, more isolated patches (habitat fragmentation) if fragmentation negatively impacts pollinator populations. Here we quantify the levels of pollen limitation and RA among large and small populations of Collinsia parviflora, a wildflower with inter-population variation in flower size. We found that none of the populations were pollen limited, as pollen-supplemented and intact flowers did not differ in seed production. There was a significant effect of flower size on RA; intact flowers (can self) produced significantly more seeds than emasculated flowers (require pollen delivery) in small-flowered plants but not large-flowered plants. Population size nested within flower size did not significantly affect RA, but there was a large difference between our two replicate populations for large-flowered, small populations and small-flowered, large populations that appears related to a more variable pollination environment under these conditions. In fact, levels of RA were strongly negatively correlated with rates of pollinator visitation, whereby infrequent visitation by pollinators yielded high levels of RA via autonomous selfing, but there was no benefit of autonomous selfing when visitation rates were high.

Ficus trees can only reproduce if they are pollinated by highly specific wasps. In highly seasonal habitats, when only few trees occur at a specific site, gaps in fruiting may lead to the extinction of the local pollinator population. This paper demonstrates that in a dioecious fig tree, Ficus hirta, the fig wasp population can be maintained successfully within an individual plant, through the strong intra-tree asynchrony in flowering. By experimentally bagging trees, we showed that the pollinating wasps (Blastophaga javana hilli) could live for two generations, and the non-pollinating wasps (Sycoscapter sp.) for up to three generations in a closed intra-tree system. However, there was a sharp decline in wasp abundance, deviating sex ratios and decreasing flower occupancy before their ultimate extinction, indicating that the wasp populations were not sustainable. This phenological strategy may enable dioecious figs, which are not constrained by the cost of selfing, to occupy a wider breadth of niches in both tropical and seasonal habitats. © 2007 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049084412

Pollinator availability, seed set, selfing rate, diversity of pollen donors, and fitness of progenies were compared between less and more isolated genets, which differed in the number of compatible opposite-morph genets within 20 m, the range at which most pollen flow occurred. Although pollinator availability did not differ between the two groups, seed set and diversity of pollen donors in more isolated genets were significantly lower than in less isolated genets. Additionally, the mean selfing rates of less and more isolated genets were 1.3 and 36.7%, respectively, and the mean leaf area of the self-fertilized seedlings was 70 to 40% smaller than that of outcrossed seedlings of the same mother genet. Due to this large inbreeding depression, it is unlikely that self-fertilized seedlings could successfully establish in natural habitats and hence the inbreeding level in the next generation around the more isolated genet would not increase rapidly. However, the possibility of mating between full-sibs would increase because the diversity of pollen donors was low and both pollen and seed dispersal were spatially restricted. Thus the inbreeding level of the next generations would gradually increase around the more isolated genets owing to biparental inbreeding. This study suggested that the population density of compatible neighbours has a critical impact on the future inbreeding level within P. sieboldii populations. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Heterostyly; Inbreeding depression; Paternity analysis; Spatial structure; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40349113314

As soon as they are emitted to the atmosphere, however, hydrocarbons are destroyed by chemical reactions involving pollutants such as ozone. It is therefore likely that increased air pollution interferes with pollinator attracting hydrocarbon signals. To test this hypothesis, a Lagrangian diffusion model was used to determine the position of air parcels away from hydrocarbon sources and to estimate the rate of chemical destruction of hydrocarbons as air parcels moved across the landscape. The hydrocarbon compounds linalool, ?-myrcene, and ?-ocimene were chosen because they are known to be common scents released from flowers. The suppressed ambient abundances of volatile organic compounds were determined in response to increased regional levels of ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals. The results indicate that the documented increases in air pollution concentrations, from pre-industrial to present times, can lead to reductions in volatile compound concentrations insects detect as they pollinate flowers. For highly reactive volatiles the maximum downwind distance from the source at which pollinators can detect the scents may have changed from kilometers during pre-industrial times to <200 m during the more polluted conditions of present times. The increased destruction of floral signals in polluted air masses may have important implications for both pollinators and signaling plants. When patches of flowers are further apart than the visual range of pollinators, such as in fragmented landscapes, the loss of scent signals may mean that pollinators spend more time searching for patches and less time foraging. This decrease in pollinator foraging efficiency will simultaneously decrease the pollinator's reproductive output and the amount of pollen flow in flowering plants.",Hydrocarbons; Hydroxyl radical; Oxidants; Ozone; Pollinators; Pollution; Terpenes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40049087875

A few species have been developed for crop pollination, but the diversity, abundance, and potential pollination contributions of native cavity-nesting bees within agricultural systems have seldom been assessed. Our objectives were to compare the diversity and fecundity of cavity-nesting bees in Nova Scotia in natural ecosystems with those in apple orchards under three levels of management, using trap nests, and to determine whether any native bees show promise for development as pollinators. Our results show that species richness and numbers of bees reared from trap nests in commercially managed orchards, abandoned orchards, and natural habitats were similar, and species' compositional patterns were not unique to specific habitats. Trap nests can be used to increase and maintain cavity-nesting bee populations within Nova Scotia apple orchards. Osmia tersula Cockerell (Megachilidae), which accounted for almost 45% of all bees captured and was the most abundant species nesting in all habitats evaluated, should be assessed for potential as a commercial pollinator of spring-flowering crops.

Recently, it has been hypothesized that 90% to 95% of avocado flowers are self-pollinated in southern Florida. However, this hypothesis does not address whether mature, marketable avocado fruit in Florida are the result of outcrossing. To determine whether avocado fruit in southern Florida result from self-pollination or outcrossing, fruit were harvested from a commercial orchard in Miami-Dade County, Florida, from a block consisting of two cultivars, Simmonds (Flowering Type A) and Tonnage (Flowering Type B), interplanted in approximately equal numbers. Seeds were germinated and the resulting progeny were genoryped using eight fully informative, microsatellite markers.

Independent and combined data from nuclear and chloroplast sequences (trnL-trnF, ITS) were analyzed with Bayesian and parsimony methods to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of Campanula and allied genera, and explore the biological processes that occurred during the evolution of this genus. The main sections and subgenera of Campanula and related genera were sampled extensively. Chromosome numbers, corolla types, habit and capsule dehiscence were mapped on the trees to search for evolutionary patterns. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that Campanula, as currently circumscribed, is not monophyletic. This genus is divided into two main clades: a large core of Campanula species that includes related genera (Adenophora, Asyneuma, Azorina, Campanulastrum, Diosphaera, Edraianthus, Githopsis, Hanabusaya, Heterocodon, Legousia, Michauxia, Petromarula, Physoplexis, Phyteuma, Trachelium, and Triodanis), and a clade constituted by Musschia plus two Campanula species. The large core of Campanula is divided into two main groups, a rapunculoid and a campanuloid group. Both Bayesian and Parsimony analyses indicate that the main morphological characters used in classifications, such as flower shape and capsule dehiscence, have arisen in parallel. Strong selective pressures from pollinators are suggested to explain floral convergence.

A main source of trade-offs is conflicting selection, a phenomenon very likely in complex multispecific scenarios in which many potential selective agents coexist. The main goal of this study is to investigate the selective trade-offs arising due to conflicting selection on female-fitness components in Erysimum mediohispanicum. I quantified the selection exerted on 10 plant traits by a mutualistic (pollinators) and antagonistic (gall-makers, predispersal and postdispersal seed predators, mammalian herbivores) multispecific assemblage acting sequentially throughout eight selective episodes of the plant, from floral bud to juvenile production. Variation in lifetime female fitness (quantified as number of juveniles) was related mostly to variation in number of flowers, fruit initiation, and seedling establishment. The direction of selection changed among different selective episode for many traits. Most importantly, conflicting selection was frequent in the study system, with half of the phenotypic traits experiencing opposing selection in different selective episodes. Selection at individual life-cycle stages diverged remarkably from selection based on total fitness. Consequently, the evolution of many traits is determined by the relative importance of each episode of selection, with conflicting selection inevitably yielding evolutionary compromises. © 2008 The Author(s).",Conflicting selection; Erysimum mediohispanicum; Independent fitness components; Multiplicative path analysis; Selective episodes; Trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40449088880

In flowering plants, the extent of multiple paternity is determined by factors such as floral biology, properties of the pollen vector, selfing rate, spatial organization of the population, and genetic compatibility between neighbours. To assess the extent of multiple paternity and identify ecological factors involved, we performed a detailed study of mating patterns in a small population of a self-incompatible clonal herb, Arabidopsis halleri. We mapped and genotyped 364 individuals and 256 of their offspring at 12 microsatellite loci and jointly analysed the level of multiple paternity, pollen and seed dispersal, and spatial genetic structure. We found very low levels of correlated paternity among sibs (Pfull-sib = 3.8%) indicating high multiple paternity. Our estimate of the outcrossing rate was 98.7%, suggesting functional self-incompatibility. The pollen dispersal distribution was significantly restricted (mean effective pollen dispersal distance: 4.42 m) but long-distance successful pollination occurred and immigrating pollen was at most 10% of all pollination events. Patterns of genetic structure indicated little extent of clonal reproduction, and a low but significant spatial genetic structure typical for a self-incompatible species. Overall, in spite of restricted pollen dispersal, the multiple paternity in this self-incompatible species was very high, a result that we interpret as a consequence of high plant density and high pollinator service in this population. © 2008 The Authors.",Arabidopsis halleri; Mating patterns; Multiple paternity; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40449135358

Furthermore, it is likely that the magnitude of birch pollen seasons in Pozna?, Worcester and London is linked in some way to different phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Significant positive relationships exist between birch pollen counts at Pozna? and temperatures, rainfall and averages of the NAO in the year before pollination. An opposite relationship is evident at the two sites studied in the United Kingdom. There were significant positive correlations between the severity of birch pollen seasons recorded at Worcester and temperatures and averages of the NAO during the winter and spring in the year of pollination, and negative correlations at both Worcester and London with similar variables from the previous year. In addition, Betula pollen seasons in Krakow do not appear to be influenced by the NAO, which is probably the result of Krakow having a more continental climate. © 2007 ISB.",Betula pollen season severity; Birch pollen; North Atlantic Oscillation; Poland; United Kingdom,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39449095139

The western leading edge of L. dispar, central Wisconsin, overlaps substantial areas of remnant oak savannas and prairies. A major tool employed in ecologically sensitive areas is Gypchek, a gypsy moth-specific nucleopolyhedrosis virus applied in conjunction with Carrier 038-A, a surfactant and sunscreen. We tested Carrier 038-A alone and with Gypchek on an endangered species, the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov), tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta L.) as a surrogate of sphingid pollinators of the Eastern prairie fringed orchid, L. dispar, and seven other Lepidoptera species selected for comparison. We first tested all 10 species using a relatively high volume compared to field application. Where there was potential evidence of nontarget effects we proceeded to a spray-deposition method to approximate field application. Eight species showed no effect of either Gypchek or its carrier, the gypsy moth was sensitive to Gypchek as expected but not to its carrier, and L. m. samuelis showed putative effects in this preliminary assay to warrant further testing. With spray-deposition, there was no consistent statistically significant impact of carrier 038-A or Gypcheck with carrier on L. m. samuelis larvae. Extrapolation to field conditions is not possible, but it seems likely that the partial canopy cover of oak savannas and partially asynchronous phenology with L. dispar would reduce exposure to L. m. samuelis.

To test the hybridisation hypothesis we applied chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers and isozymes in the analyses of 300 individuals representing the variety of morphological forms in the sympatric populations of P. sylvestris, P. mugo and P. uliginosa at the peat bog complex in the Sudety Mts., Poland. Additionally, the haplotypes of paternally inherited cpDNA of 149 open pollinated progeny derived from seeds were compared to the haplotypes of parental trees to access the intensity and direction of contemporary hybridisation. The morphologically highly variable polycormic (multi-stemmed) hybrids between P. mugo and P. uliginosa were identified. The second group of hybrids was found among the monocormic (single-stemmed) P. sylvestris-like individuals carrying the cpDNA from P. mugo complex. Hybrids of P. sylvestris as a pollen donor and P. mugo or P. uliginosa as a mother were not found, either in the group of examined trees, or among the open pollinated progeny. The results indicate that numerous hybrids can exist in the sympatric population of the species studied and that gene flow can successfully proceed from P. mugo complex to P. sylvestris.

The accumulation rates showed single-peak curves. The accumulation rates of starch and its components reached their peaks on 25-32 days after pollination (DAP), respectively. Activities of adenosine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPPase) and starch synthase in the grains of four lines followed single-peak curves with the peaks on 24-31 DAP. The highest activity of the starch-branching enzyme (Q-enzyme) in the grains of both high-starch lines appeared on 23 DAP, but that of both low-starch inbred lines showed double-peak curves, the peaks being at 15-20 DAP and 30-35 DAP.

Argentine ant invasions can also exert other effects on the community through interactions with plants and their associated arthropods. For example, carbohydrate resources (e.g. floral or extrafloral nectar) may influence foraging behaviour and interactions among ants and other arthropods. In South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, Argentine ants and some native ant species are attracted to the floral nectar of Leucospermum conocarpodendron Rourke (Proteaceae), a native tree that also has extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited inflorescences more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging was influenced by the EFNs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to inflorescences with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to ant-excluded inflorescences. Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75% less time foraging on inflorescences with Argentine ants than on inflorescences without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to inflorescences had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen-limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the inflorescences, but did not differ among inflorescences visited by native and Argentine ants. Displacement of arthropods appears to be a consistent consequence of Argentine ant invasions. The displacement of floral arthropods by Argentine ants may have far-reaching consequences for this biodiversity hotspot and other regions that are rich in insect-pollinated plants. © 2007 The Author.",Biological invasions; Extrafloral nectaries; Flowers; Leucospermum conocarpodendron; Linepithema humile; Nectar; Protea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849159272

Average flowering durations of individual flowers, genets, and the whole population in these 3 years were 10.2, 15.2, and 29.0 d, respectively. A bisexual phase (with both female and male phase flowers) in genets spanned 62.9% of the total flowering period, suggesting that geitonogamy can occur. The earliness, duration, and amplitude of flowering genets were all significantly correlated, indicating that genets flower early and long periods have high flowering amplitudes. The three parameters were also significantly correlated with the size of the genets (represented by the diameter at breast height of its thickest ramet) and relative photosynthetic photon flux density at the top of their crowns. Therefore, genets that are large and located in well-lit sites tend to have many flowers, and blossom both earlier and longer. Later-flowering genets have higher female reproductive success, probably because M. stellata is protogynous. Significantly positive correlation between flowering amplitude and female reproductive success suggests that large numbers of flowers increase the attractiveness of genets for pollinators, and this outweighs the negative effects of geitonogamy. © 2008 NRC.",Geitonogamy; Photoenvironment; Plant size; Protogyny; Seed production; Star magnolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449141388

In five explorations conducted during the crop seasons of 1999-2003, 169 landraces of pearl millet were collected from 18 districts of Rajasthan. There was a good amount of variation among them for various morphological descriptors. Majority of them had thin to medium thin stems and possessed the ability to produce nodal tillers. Panicle compactness, seed covered either fully or partially in glume and good panicle exertion appeared to be the common feature of Rajasthan landraces. There was a good variation for the agronomic value of landraces and also as green fodder source. The analysis of variance indicated considerable scope to select landraces with different combinations of earliness and grain and stover productivity. The earliness as available in the extra early elite cultivar HHB 67 is not available in landraces. However, the earliness in several landraces comparable to medium maturing open-pollinated variety CZP 923 does exist. The results indicated that the choice of landraces for higher stover yield is greater than that for grain yield, but is often at the cost of earliness.

In patchily distributed plant species, seed production is likely to be influenced both by local abiotic factors affecting plant size and conditions for fruit maturation, and by population characteristics affecting the intensity of interactions with mutualists and antagonists. However, the relative importance of these effects is poorly known. 2. We used multiple regression and path models to examine the importance of abiotic factors (sun exposure, soil depth) and population characteristics (size, density and connectivity) for variation in flower and fruit production and intensity of seed predation among 39 populations of the long-lived herb Vincetoxicum hirundinaria in three consecutive years. In addition, we manipulated water availability in a field experiment and recorded short-term and long-term effects on fruit output, and conducted a supplemental hand-pollination experiment. 3. Flower production varied little, while fruit initiation, fruit abortion and fruit predation varied considerably among years. Sun exposure and soil depth affected fruit production per plant indirectly and positively through their effects on flower number. Population density affected fruit production negatively through its effect on flower number. Both fruit initiation and the proportion of fruits attacked by the tephritid fly Euphranta connexa were related positively to population size. 4. The number of full-size fruits per plant was related positively to sun exposure and population size in two years each, and related negatively to population density in one year. However, because of seed predation, the number of intact mature fruits was related significantly to population characteristics in only one of three years. 5. The field experiments showed that both shortage of water and insufficient pollination may limit fruit set in V. hirundinaria. 6. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that the relative importance of local abiotic conditions and population characteristics may vary considerably along the chain of events from flower formation to intact fruit, and also among years. They further show that, at least in species with a naturally patchy distribution, connectivity may be relatively unimportant for variation in reproductive output compared to effects of habitat quality, population size and density. © 2008 The Authors.",Asclepiadaceae; Flower production; Fruit production; Habitat quality; Pollen limitation; Population density; Population size; Resource limitation; Vincetoxicum hirundinaria,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849171801

Mill (Taxaceae), is an endangered species endemic to the Western Himalayas. An investigation of the genetic diversity of wild populations of T. fuana in Pakistan was undertaken. The genetic diversity and genetic structure was quantified using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation in 219 individuals of the 10 populations. Of the 32 universal primers screened 16 produced highly reproducible, clear RAPD bands. Using these primers, 193 discernible DNA fragments were generated, of which 164 (84.97%) were polymorphic. The statistical results indicated that there was a relatively low genetic diversity within populations (with percentages of polymorphic bands, PPB, ranging from 29.53 to 50.26%, with an average of 38.34% and a Nei's genetic diversity index (HE) of 0.1165), and a high genetic differentiation among populations (GST = 0.5842, ?ST = 0.5685) within these populations. The gene flow (Nm) was low with only 0.3558. The distribution of genetic diversity revealed among the wild populations of T. fuana in Pakistan may result from their evolutionary history including habitat fragmentation, genetic drift combined with limited gene flow. The results are unexpected for an outcrossing, wind-pollinated and long-lived woody species.

For mutualistic networks, species degree has been suggested to follows a power distribution or a truncated power distribution. In this paper, I discuss previously estimated parameters and associated model selection may be unreliable. I use the likelihood approach and compare the results from previous findings and show that the parameter estimates as well as model selection results are indeed very different. Furthermore, the likelihood approach reveals that many mutualistic networks do not follow either power distribution or truncated power distribution. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, modern cotton cultivars should have accumulated additive genetic effects with time, while also possessing fewer nonadditive gene effects than obsolete cultivars. A topcross test was conducted to compare the heterotic effects of obsolete and modern cultivars for yield, yield components, and fiber quality. Significant differences were detected between heterosis values for the modern and obsolete cultivar groups for seed cotton yield, lint yield, lint percentage, and boll weight. No significant heterotic effects were detected for fiber quality. The obsolete group of cultivars showed average lint yield heterosis values of 34% compared with 23% for the modern cultivars. Both cultivar groups displayed significant, but similar heterosis values for the number of bolls per square meter (17 and 15%, respectively). The major yield component associated with lint yield heterosis for both groups was bolls per square meter, although boll weight heterosis also contributed to lint yield heterosis for the obsolete cultivars.

At pollination, three palms per palm tree were taken at the median position, the lower green palm, and the last open palm. Leaflets were analyzed on the entire palm split into 4 zones. A broad variation of the palm portions leaflets' mineral composition is shown. The median zone leaflet nitrogen (N) and magnesium (Mg) contents were the highest for all of the palm positions. A similar nitrogen and magnesium determination was noticed along each palm. The highest calcium (Ca) content was at the base of the youngest palm and at the apex of the oldest palm; phosphorus (P) content was the reverse. The highest potassium (K) content was determined in the base palm leaflets. For foliar diagnosis, median zone leaflet sampling of median palm at pollination is recommended.

However, neither flower shape nor colour signal the nectar content of a single flower. Such information can emerge only by an animal remembering experienced foraging profitability. Furthermore, this requires the ability to spatially discriminate between individual flowers of similar appearance, which appears to be demanding especially when multiple flowers of the same species are aggregated. In a study of the foraging behaviour of nectar-feeding bats, Glossophaga soricina, we investigated the effect of local echo acoustic cues that were spatially separated by at least 40 cm from the goal in a multiple goal-finding task.

Contrary to previous studies that recognized few species worldwide, we distinguished 12 species by molecular data, and an additional 2-3 species by morphological differences within groups that were invariant at the molecular level. Two new Vallisneria species (V. australis, V. erecta) are formally described. Other potentially novel species were detected from the cultivated material examined but require further study to elucidate their taxonomic status. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that vittate (caulescent) species (including Maidenia rubra) are not basal, but nested between two groups of rosulate (rosette) species. To preserve Vallisneria as monophyletic, a new combination is made (V. rubra) that accommodates the transfer of M. rubra to Vallisneria. Several taxonomic characters associated with the stigma morphology of pistillate flowers were found to represent suites of features related to pollination. In most cases, these character suites corresponded to a particular arrangement of filaments in the staminate flowers. The precise geographical origin of Vallisneria remains difficult to determine.

Thell.). However, few reports have dealt with the development and characterization of such variants. In the present study, the RNA interference (RNAi) method was applied to Bobwhite wheat, which has five actively expressed HMW-GS genes (namely 1Ax2*, 1Dx5, 1Bx7, 1By9, 1Dy10), with the aim of silencing the expression of 1Dx5. Out of the six transgenic events characterized, 1Dx5 expression was completely blocked in four transgenic events (L1-L4), and partially reduced in the other two (L5, L6). In contrast, the protein levels of 1Ax2*, 1By9 and 1Dy10 were not significantly affected in any of the six transgenic events. Interestingly, 1Bx7 protein accumulation was negatively affected in all six events and their progenies. 1Dx5 transcript levels in developing seeds at 15 days after pollination (DAP) were undetectable in L1 and dramatically reduced in L5. The silencing of 1Dx5 expression caused a substantial decrease in flour processing quality based on Farinograph, gluten and Zeleny tests. Collectively, our data suggest that RNAi is useful for silencing HMW-GS genes. The resultant transgenic lines are of value for studying the contributions of specific HMW-GS to wheat flour processing quality. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Several proprietary Bt hybrids are likely to be commercialized in the near future. Based on field trial data, it is shown that the technology can significantly reduce insecticide applications and increase effective yields. Comprehensive farm-survey data are used to project farm-level effects and future adoption rates. Simulations show that the aggregate economic surplus gains of Bt hybrids could be around US$108 million per year. Consumers will capture a large share of these gains, but farmers and the innovating company will benefit too. As the company has also shared its technology with the public sector, Bt open-pollinated varieties might become available with a certain time lag. This would make the technology more accessible, especially for resource-poor farmers, entailing further improvements in welfare and distribution effects. The wider implications of the private-public technology transfer are discussed. Furthermore, the potential benefits for farmers' health resulting from reduced insecticide applications are examined, using an econometric model and a cost-of-illness approach. These benefits are worth an additional $3-4 million per year, yet they constitute only a small fraction of the technology's environmental and health externalities.

Partial cDNA sequences of three hsp genes - shsp, hsc70 and hsp90 - were obtained, and the deduced amino acid sequences were found to be highly homologous with corresponding hsp of hymenopteran insects. Using northern hybridization, the transcript level of each gene was compared in six stages relating to diapause: pre-mating, post-mating, chilling for 1, 2 and 3 months, and post-chilling. The transcript level was also compared in four tissues of adult queens: brain, thoracic muscle, gut and ovary. The transcript levels of the three hsp genes changed at various rates in relation to diapause, and each pattern was highly tissue-specific. Overall patterns of hsc70 and hsp90 expression were similar in each tissue. The shsp level in the brain was downregulated after 1 month chilling, but its level in the ovary was upregulated during a long chilling period; levels in muscle and gut did not change in relation to diapause. The levels of both hsc70 and hsp90 in muscle were gradually upregulated in late diapause and postdiapause stages, but levels in the ovary were downregulated during the chilling period, while levels in the brain and gut did not change in relation to diapause. Our results show that the three hsp genes were differentially regulated in stage- and tissue-specific manners throughout diapause, and suggest unique physiological roles for these genes in relation to diapause in each tissue of queen bumblebees. © 2008 The Authors.",Bombus terrestris; Diapause; Gene expression; Heat shock protein gene; Tissue variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40849126776

The effects of medium composition, pollen parent, and year of cross on embryo development and recovery in cultured ovules were investigated to improve in ovulo embryo rescue from stenospermocarpic parents commonly used in breeding seedless grapes for the Australian table and dried grape industries. Increasing CaCl2 concentrations in the culture medium improved embryo recovery, but embryo emergence from ovules and germination rates were unaffected by varying FeEDTA concentrations. A casein hydrolysate supplement in the culture medium improved embryo recovery, emergence, and germination. Embryo recovery varied with parental genotype and ranged from 5% to 14% in 4 self-pollinated genotypes. Mean embryo recoveries from ovules cultured 50 days after controlled cross-pollination from berries of the pollen-sterile, stenospermocarpic variety 'Carina' were 36% and 26% where the pollen parents were seeded (11 crosses) and seedless (6 crosses), respectively. Embryo recovery and germination were affected by the year in which a cross was made and there was a significant cross x year interaction. The results indicated that in ovulo embryo rescue can be improved by increasing CaCl2 concentrations and incorporating a casein hydrolysate supplement in the basal medium, by exploiting genotypic differences through the use of seedless parents that yield greater proportions of rescued hybrids, and possibly by understanding environmental effects on female parents to maximise the numbers of hybrids produced. © CSIRO 2008.",Genotype x year interaction; Genotypic effect; In ovulo embryo culture; Medium composition; Stenospermocarpy; Vitis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39549083504

Furthermore, some of these markers were transferable and polymorphic across 15 other wild American, African and Asian species and revealed consistent relationships between species, together with a strong pattern of Old World versus New World differentiation in the genus. These microsatellites will be very useful for diversity, hybridization and phylogeographic studies in the genus Vanilla. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While changing the cultivation environment, attention is needed to ensure adequate pollen transfer to the stigma due to absence of wind, isolation from wild pollinators and low viability of reproductive organs due to the extreme temperature under those conditions. This study explores the effects of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) pollination on various fruit characteristics of several different cultivars of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) under enclosed conditions. In all 16 cultivars examined during two growing seasons, bee pollination increased numbers of seeds per fruit, and had a significantly positive effect on fruit placenta weight, fruit weight, fruit width and fruit-wall thickness. While fruit diameter consistently correlated with bee pollination, fruit-length response alternated between seasons. It may be concluded that although bee pollination is a powerful tool for affecting fruit characteristics in sweet pepper, each cultivar exhibits different levels of response. Cultivars need to be evaluated separately, relative to market demand, when considering the use of bees for pollination.",Capsicum annuum; Cultivar; Fruit; Honeybee; Pollination; Sweet pepper,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650085061

Solanum carolinense (horsenettle) is a highly successful weed with a gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) system. Previous studies reveal that the strength of SI in S. carolinense is a plastic trait, associated with particular S-alleles. The importance of this variation in self-fertility on the ability of horsenettle to found and establish new populations will depend, to a large extent, on the magnitude of inbreeding depression. We performed a series of greenhouse and field experiments to determine the magnitude of inbreeding depression in S. carolinense, whether inbreeding depression varies by family, and whether the estimates of inbreeding depression vary under field and greenhouse conditions. We performed a series of controlled self- and cross-pollinations on 16 genets collected from a large population in Pennsylvania to obtain progeny with different levels of inbreeding. We grew the selfed and outcrossed progeny in the greenhouse and under field conditions and recorded various measures of growth and reproductive output. Results. In the greenhouse study we found (1) a reduction in flower, fruit and seed production per fruit in inbred (selfed) progeny when compared to outbred (outcrossed) progeny; (2) a reduction in growth of resprouts obtained from rhizome cuttings of selfed progeny; and (3) an increase in the ability to self-fertilize in the selfed progeny. In the field, we found that (1) outcrossed progeny produced more leaves than their selfed siblings; (2) herbivory seems to add little to inbreeding depression; and (3) outcrossed plants grew faster and were able to set more fruits than selfed plants. Conclusion. Solanum carolinense experiences low levels of inbreeding depression under greenhouse conditions and slightly more inbreeding depression under our field conditions. The combined effects of low levels of inbreeding depression and plasticity in the strength of SI suggest that the production of selfed progeny may play an important role in the establishment of new populations of S. carolinense. © 2008 Mena-Ali et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39149104611

Data from the survey was used to classify production systems and management intensities among watermelon producers. Cluster analysis was used to identify the most closely associated of 24 abiotic and biotic variables affecting productivity. Five clusters were identified each year, or when data were pooled across years. Cluster I combined factors of grower experience, crop rotation, fertilization, and cultivation (mechanical weed control). Cluster II combined factors of cultivar ploidy, black plastic mulch, irrigation frequency, hoeing frequency, row arrangement, pollination, and planting method. Close distances among components implied that these two clusters had the strongest associations; indicating that two primary production systems exist. To measure management intensity of these production systems, a method was developed by: (1) partitioning four economic categories as machinery, labor, supply, and risk for each survey variable; (2) assigning weight scores of 0 or 1 to each category; and (3) summing the weight scores across economic categories for all factors involved in each production system. The most commonly used production system (50%) consisted of Cluster I, which was considered of intermediate management intensity with scores 12 and 36. The production system considered as high management intensity with scores 36 was rarely used, but always combined components within Clusters I and II.

Because of diverse climatic conditions open field cultivation for most horticultural products is possible in many provinces and in all seasons. However, in recent years protected cultivation has increased in Iran. Low light intensities in northern Iran are the main limitations to vegetables cultivation in tunnel-houses, especially during autumn and winter. The provinces of Guilan and Mazenderan are the main producers of vegetable crops in northern part of Iran. Cultivation of these crops is mostly as soil-culture in PE covered tunnel-houses. Insufficient ventilation is one of the most important problems particularly in PE covered houses. Soil and water pollution by waste nutrients in field culture and soil culture in tunnel-house is a problem. Soilless culture can be an alternative to soil culture when serious soil and water problems, i.e., soilborne pests, soil and water salinity, chemical residues in soil, water salinity, lack of fertile soil, and water shortages, create difficulties in traditional soil-based production. Progress has been made in development of soilless systems. Some growers are using soilless culture. The area under soilless cultivation reached approximately 10 ha/producer in Iran. Irrigation in tunnel-houses is commonly through emitters attached to plastic pipes; use of drip irrigation which decreases water loss, is limited. Pollinators are not used with pollination of vegetables occurring through wind action or by shaking plants. More progress in development of soilless technology is needed.",Iran; Soil culture; Soilless culture; Tunnel-house,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650034910

Moench]. Gene expression analyses for CWI using RNA gel blot and real-time quantitative PCR approaches on developing caryopses, including the glumes (maternal tissue appended to the seeds), showed expression of SbIncw (ZmIncw2 ortholog) primarily in the basal sugar unloading zone of endosperm. The expression of ZmIncw1 ortholog was significantly less abundant and restricted to the glumes. The protein and enzyme activity data corroborated the temporal transcript expression profile that showed maximal CWI protein (INCW) expression preceding the starch-filling phase of endosperm development, i.e. 6-12 d-after-pollination (DAP). Protein gel blot analysis using polyclonal maize INCW1 antibodies showed a single polypeptide of 72 kDa. The highest level of enzyme activity was unique to the basal part of the endosperm, in particular the basal endosperm transfer cell (BETC) layer and the maternal pedicel region that were highly enriched for the INCW protein, as seen by immunolocalization. High hexose-to-sucrose ratio in 6-12 DAP seeds, and negligible starch deposition in glumes corroborated the CWI activity data. Additionally, we report transcription profiles of several other genes related to sugar-to-starch metabolism in developing sorghum endosperm. As in maize, the INCW-mediated apoplastic cleavage of sucrose in the BETC and pedicel during the early developmental stages of caryopses is essential for the normal development of filial tissues. The unique cell-specificity of the INCW protein to both proximal and distal ends of placental sac shown here for the first time is likely to greatly increase uptakes of both hexose sugars and water through turgor sensing into developing seed.

Trials were conducted in E. globulus seed orchards in Tasmania, Australia, to identify the timing of capsule development and abortion, as well as the influence of pollination type, the number of ovules fertilised and weather events on capsule set. Controlled pollination (CP), mass supplementary pollination (MSP), open pollination (OP) and isolated unpollinated control (UP) treatments were performed on 21 genotypes in an orchard in southern Tasmania in 2004-2005 and on six genotypes in a higher-altitude orchard in north-western Tasmania in 2005-2006. No capsules were set in the UP control treatment, and capsule set was significantly lower following CP than OP and MSP. The major period of capsule abortion occurred between 20 and 80 days after pollination for all pollination methods across both sites, coinciding with the period of capsule growth. A positive correlation between the number of fertilised ovules per aborted capsule and the length of time capsules were held on the tree was recorded. Given that capsule abortion occurred during a period of fruit growth and that capsules with the lowest number of fertilised ovules aborted first, it is argued that fertilisation level and the level of resource competition are major factors determining capsule abortion. © CSIRO 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949113676

Resetting of the FLC expression level in progeny is an important step in the life cycle of the plant. We show that both the paternally derived and the maternally derived FLC:GUS genes are reset to activity but that the timing of their first expression differs. The paternal FLC:GUS gene in vernalized plants is expressed in the male reproductive organs, the anthers, in both somatic tissue and in the sporogenous pollen mother cells, but there is no expression in mature pollen. In the progeny generation, the paternally derived FLC:GUS gene is expressed in the single-celled zygote (fertilized egg cell) and through embryo development, but not in the fertilized central cell, which generates the endosperm of the progeny seed. FLC:GUS is not expressed during female gametogenesis, with the maternally derived FLC:GUS being first expressed in the early multicellular embryo. We show that FLC activity during late embryo development is a prerequisite for the repressive action of FLC on flowering. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Arabidopsis; Embryo; Gametogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149160719

Previous research suggests that specialist pollinators can promote rapid diversification in plants, and theoretical work has predicted that obligate pollination mutualism promotes cospeciation between plants and their pollinators, resulting in contemporaneous, parallel diversification. However, a lack of information about the age of Yucca has impeded efforts to test these hypotheses. We used analyses of 4322 AFLP markers and cpDNA sequence data representing six non-protein-coding regions (trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL intron, trnL-trnF, rps16 and clpP intron 2) from all 34 species to recover a consensus organismal phylogeny, and used penalized likelihood to estimate divergence times and speciation rates in Yucca. The results indicate that the pollination mutualism did not accelerate diversification, as Yucca diversity (34 species) is not significantly greater than that of its non-moth-pollinated sister group, Agave sensu latissimus (240 species). The new phylogenetic estimates also corroborate the suggestion that the plant-moth pollination mutualism has at least two origins within the Agavaceae. Finally, age estimates show significant discord between the age of Yucca (ca 6-10Myr) and the current best estimates for the age of their pollinators (32-40Myr). © 2007 The Royal Society.",Adaptive radiation; AFLP; Agavaceae; Agave; cpDNA; Yucca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37349070275

The highly synchronized nocturnal pollen release is unusual for an abiotic pollinator, and we hypothesize that this may be a mechanism to ensure fertilization or, alternatively, may be a reponse to avoid pollen predation by fish. © Inter-Research 2008.",Caribbean Sea; Fish; Hydrophilous pollination; Scaridae; Seagrass; Synchronization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40149095910

However, there is scarce evidence on how this practice affects kernel weight (KW) and plant grain yield (PGY), and no report exists on its effects when combined with treatments aimed to reduce apical dominance, like male sterility and detasseling. Field experiments were conducted in two growing seasons (Exp1 and Exp2) using two hybrids, cropped at contrasting stand densities (3 and 9 plants per m2) and including (i) male-fertile and male-sterile versions, (ii) tasseled and detasseled plants, and (iii) natural (NP) and synchronous pollination (SP; pollen added manually to ears bagged 5 days after initial silking) systems. Tassel growth of sterile and fertile versions was also evaluated in a separate experiment (Exp3). Detasseling increased the number of ears per plant reaching silking (P &lt; 0.001) of NP plants, but this beneficial effect of reduced apical dominance did not improve kernel number per plant (KNP) or PGY. Similarly, the early arrest of anther growth in male-sterile plants had no clear benefit on KNP. In contrast, KNP was enhanced by synchronous pollination (range between -13% and +71%; average of +15.4% in Exp1 and +3.9% in Exp2). However, this pollination system promoted a decreased in KW (range between -30% and +4%; average of -11.8% in Exp1 and -7.8 in Exp2) such that the treatment had no effect on PGY (range between -19% and +37%; average of +1% in Exp1 and -4% in Exp2). Because plant growth rate around flowering was not different between pollination treatments, assimilate availability per kernel was reduced from ovary fertilization onwards in synchronously pollinated plants when compared to open pollinated plants. This explains the reduced KW when increasing KNP by synchronous pollination. In summary, none of the imposed treatments allowed grain yield to be increased at the plant level. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report parallel evolution of saucer-shaped flowers and an associated unusual pollination system within the lineage Heucherina, a group of saxifragaceous genera. Field observations reveal that 18 of 28 plant species studied are pollinated almost exclusively by fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae). Among the 18 species with a fungus-gnat pollination system, 13 have characteristic saucer-shaped flowers and are pollinated mainly by several unspecialized mycetophilid genera with short mouthparts. We performed phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequences of external and internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA and reconstructed ancestral floral morphologies with an establishment of the model of floral character evolution under a maximum-likelihood framework. Our analysis indicates that there is significant directionality in the evolutionary shifts of floral forms in the Heucherina. The inferred phylogeny further supports four origins of saucer-shaped flowers, which is shared among 14 species that are traditionally classified into the genus Mitella. In addition, our analysis indicates the extensive polyphyly of genus Mitella, as also suggested previously. The results suggest that the flower-visiting fungus gnats have caused convergent selection for the saucer-shaped flower repeatedly evolved within Heucherina. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To elucidate the causes of the poor fruit set, pollen tube growth into pistils and fruit set percentage were investigated after cross-, self- and open-pollination. Ovule development in Zuili pistils was also investigated. Pollen tube penetration into the ovules via the obturator and micropyle was best when Zuili pistils were pollinated by cv. Black Amber (P. domestica) pollen grains, although cross-pollinations with Hongxinli and Miili (P. salicina) pollen were more effective than self- and open-pollination. The fruit set percentage was also highest in pistils pollinated with Black Amber pollen grains. Morphological observation of Zuili pistils revealed that the trees produce ""double pistils"", developing two ovaries from a basal pistil, at a rate as high as 28%. In such abnormal pistils, most ovules were lacking an embryo sac or were entirely degenerated. The percentage of normally developed ovules was 24.3% and 8.9% in normal and double pistils, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the main causes of poor fruit set of Zuili plums are a lack of effective cross-pollination and the production of high percentages of double pistils in which normally developed ovules are scarcely formed. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Double pistils; Pollentube; Pollination; Poorfruit set; Zuiliplum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40149102668

The following pollination systems were observed in 18 species: moth pollination, generalized insect pollination, wasp pollination, dipteran pollination, both dipteran and moth pollination, and autogamy. Principal component analysis based on 13 floral characters indicated that the size of the pollinator tended to increase with sizes of all characters measured. Furthermore, species that have developed interstaminal parts of the corona and concealed stigmatic chambers tend to be pollinated by long-tongued insects. The phylogenetic distribution of pollinator types showed that species belonging to Clade I are pollinated exclusively by Diptera, whereas those of Clade II are pollinated by four insect orders. The most prominent pollinator transition in the Tylophora-Vincetoxicum complex is dipteran to moth pollination. The most common morphological change of the plants from dipteran pollination to moth pollination, or vice versa, is modification of the corolla. In the Tylophora-Vincetoxicum complex, pollination mode shifts are generally accompanied by modifications of the corona and the structure of gynostegium. One hypothesis for the rapid radiation observed in Clade II is that a widely distributed species may have partitioned its distribution in the relatively near past and adapted to various environments, in which the dominant pollinators were different, and that the local races may then have diverged from each other after they were isolated. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Corona; Diptera; Gynostegium; Lepidoptera; Pollinaria; Pollinator; Rapid radiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049156676

Because flowering phenology, photosynthetic characteristics, and fruiting success respond to such strong seasonality in light availability, we hypothesized that understory plants in such ecosystems should describe distinct phenological groups or syndromes where ""syndrome"" is defined only as a set of characteristics that co-occur. To identify these phenological syndromes, we studied the flowering phenology, fruit or seed set, and photosynthetic characteristics for 18 perennial understory herbaceous species that differed in reproductive strategy over eight years in a deciduous forest in northern Japan. Three phenological groups emerged from this study: (1) spring bloomers, flowering and fruiting before the completion of canopy closure; (2) early-summer bloomers, flowering during the progress of canopy closure and fruiting after canopy closure; and (3) late-summer bloomers, flowering and fruiting after canopy closure. The spring bloomers had high photosynthetic rates and high fruiting abilities, but the flowering time varied considerably among years due to yearly fluctuations of snowmelt date. Bumble bee-pollinated species of spring bloomers showed variable seed-set success, while fly-pollinated species showed relatively stable seed sets over the years. The early-summer bloomers showed low fruiting abilities irrespective of pollination success, reflecting severe resource limitation with decelerating light availability during fruit development. Although the late-summer bloomers showed low photosynthetic rates under low-light conditions, high fruit-set success was attained if pollination was sufficient. These results support our hypothesis that phenological syndromes may be found in deciduous forest understory plants. Given that reproductive success of bee-pollinated spring bloomers is highly susceptible to seasonal fluctuation, climate change may have its strongest impacts on this group. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Deciduous forest; Flowering phenology; Fruit set; Light availability; Photosynthetic rate; Pollination; Seasonal dynamics; Understory herbs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849107767

If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant-pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant-pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics. © 2008 Aizen et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-40149083748

Fragmentation-related effects have been poorly investigated in the case of palms, an important structural and functional component of tropical forests. We examined the relationships between fragment size and diversity and abundance of flower visitors, and palm reproduction, by quantifying the arthropod fauna associated to inflorescences of the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum, and its fruit set, in fragments of different size. The sample yielded a total of 228,772 arthropods (10 orders, 60 species). Coleoptera was the predominant group (?50% of the species), followed by Hymenoptera (20%), while the remaining (30%) was distributed among the other eight orders. We found a predominance of pollinating insects (Coleoptera-Nitidulidae), representing 85% of all visitors. Pollinator abundance was negatively affected by fragmentation, with a 4.2-fold average difference between small (<35 ha) and large (114-700 ha) fragments. However, fruit set was relatively high (?0.7) and not affected by fragmentation during three reproductive seasons. This could be explained because small fragments retained remarkably high numbers of pollinators (1191.4/inflorescence) and by the high abundance of palms (and flowers) in fragments. Further research is needed, however, to assess if fragmentation restricts pollinator movements to plants within the fragments, leading to a reduction in genetic variation of the progeny present in forest remnants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compared the performance of four hybrids with SBRM-resistant pollinators to two susceptible hybrids, with and without insecticide, in four environments.

In two environments, the root yields of the SBRM-susceptible hybrids were low and the difference between the root yields with and without insecticide was relatively small, indicating the insecticide was ineffective. In contrast, the root yields of the SBRM-resistant hybrids, with or without insecticide, in these trials were substantially higher than the susceptible hybrids and similar to corresponding root yields at the other sites. Based upon these trials, it appears that hybrids produced with the currently available resistance sources would have sufficient SBRM resistance to prevent catastrophic yield reductions due to SBRM feeding, could reduce uncertainty caused by fluctuations in insecticide effectiveness, would provide protection against the development of insecticide-resistant SBRM strains, and also provide a useful level of SBRM protection, if the current insecticides were no longer available. © 2008 The Authors.",Beta vulgaris; Host plant resistance; Tetanops myopaeformis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349078484

Here, we investigate patterns of outcrossed mating through male function in Narcissus triandrus, a tristylous, bee-pollinated wild daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula, to test pollen transfer models which predict that floral morphology promotes asymmetrical mating and biased morph ratios. Unlike other tristylous species, N. triandrus has an incompatibility system that permits intra-morph mating and long-level rather than mid-level stamens in the L-morph. Incomplete sex-organ reciprocity should result in significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph. We measured mating patterns in two L-biased populations - dimorphic (two style morphs) and trimorphic (three style morphs) - using multilocus genotyping and maximum-likelihood-based paternity analysis. We also examined the spatial distribution of style morphs and neutral markers to investigate the potential consequence of spatially restricted mating on morph ratios. As predicted, we detected significant amounts of intra-morph mating in the L-morph in both populations. Pollen transfer coefficients generally supported predictions based on the Darwinian hypothesis that anthers and stigmas of equivalent level promote pollinator-mediated cross-pollination in heterostylous populations. There was evidence of significant spatial aggregation of both style morphs and neutral markers in populations of N. triandrus, probably as a result of restricted pollen and seed dispersal. Our results provide empirical support for theoretical models of pollen transfer, which indicate that the commonly observed L-biased morph ratios in Narcissus species result from significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph because of its atypical floral morphology. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39749113260

P. tenuinervis showed low outcrossing rates, varying from 37% to 50% of the mating attributable to outcrossing and 50% to 63% attributable to self-fertilization, in the three habitats. The forest interior had the highest outcrossing rate (t m = 0.50 and t s = 0.43) among the three habitats. However, there were no differences in either multilocus or single-locus rates among the three habitats, indicating that the contribution of biparental inbreeding to the apparent selfing rate in these populations was very low. The multilocus (t m) and single-locus (t s) outcrossing rates for the P. tenuinervis in the sample plots within each habitat showed great heterogeneity. In conclusion, edge creation seems not to influence its mating systems.

This study evaluates components of fitness in the field for naturally occurring hybrids of the shrub Kunzea, relative to the parental species Kunzea rupestris. Hybrid plants did not differ from the parental species in the level of effective pollination. Thus, we found no support for Grant's model (Evolution: International Journal of Organic Evolution 3: 82-97) of reduced fitness of hybrids via reduced pollination level (the intermediate hypothesis). Hybrids displayed variable fitness across the measured fitness components. Seed set levels for hybrids were structured among populations, suggesting genetic structuring for this fitness component at this scale. The response of hybrids to fire (a major selective force in the study system) was partly consistent with a resource trade-off model.

Strong positive selection was found on flower length, weak positive selection on flower width : length ratio and no selection on stigma-anther distance in both open-pollinated and supplementally pollinated treatments. By contrast, flowers with relatively narrow corollas and low stigma-anther distances were favored in the pollinator exclusion treatment. • These results provide mixed support for the idea that pollen limitation intensifies selection on floral characters. Despite strong phenotypic selection, natural pollen limitation did not mediate selection on characters associated with either pollinator attraction or self-fertilization.

The aim of this study is to produce this framework as a basis for more rigorous species delimitation and conservation recommendations. • Methods: Nuclear and plastid DNA sequencing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were performed on 85 accessions of Ophrys, spanning the full range of species aggregates currently recognized. Data were analysed using a combination of parsimony and Bayesian tree-building techniques and by principal co-ordinates analysis. • Key Results: Complementary phylogenetic analyses and ordinations using nuclear, plastid and AFLP datasets identify ten genetically distinct groups (six robust) within the genus that may in turn be grouped into three sections (treated as subgenera by some authors). Additionally, genetic evidence is provided for a close relationship between the O. tenthredinifera, O. bombyliflora and O. speculum groups. The combination of these analytical techniques provides new insights into Ophrys systematics, notably recognition of the novel O. umbilicata group. • Conclusions: Heterogeneous copies of the nuclear ITS region show that some putative Ophrys species arose through hybridization rather than divergent speciation.

Although numerous S alleles are usually maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, the number of S alleles can be low in small populations, which limits mate availability and reduces fecundity in endangered populations of self-incompatible plants. Despite the increasing evidence of the negative effect of self-incompatibility in small populations, the direct link between the number and the distribution of S alleles and their reproductive consequences has been rarely reported. Brassica insularis is a rare self-incompatible species with medium to very small populations. Results of a previous study showed that the smallest population has very few S alleles. We investigated whether reduced mate availability affects reproduction in this species. We compared the pollination success and the fruit set in 4 populations differing in population size and number of S alleles. Our results suggest that reproduction may be negatively affected by the low S-allele diversity in the smallest population.

Components of cone production in Araucaria araucana were partitioned among populations and trees to ascertain the existence of masting and the processes involved. Cone production data from seven populations were obtained during a 9-year period and seed gathering data were available for an 18-year time series from six sites in an area of more than 7600 km2. Araucaria araucana showed environmentally triggered, intermittent, moderately fluctuating, and highly regionally synchronous reproduction. The mean pairwise correlations of cones production among populations and seed gathering sites were 0.89 and 0.74, respectively, suggesting synchrony in reproduction. Among trees we observed a mean correlation of 0.74 with values ranging from 0.66 to 0.81 for the analysed populations. The existence of negative autocorrelation in seed production between year 0 and year -2 at the individual tree level suggests the presence of 'switching' or internal resource allocation, thus discarding the Resource Matching hypothesis. Mean coefficient of variation (CVp) among populations was moderate (0.95) and similar to the modal CVp values reported in the published reports. Mean CVi among individual trees was 1.16, suggesting a large number of equally and synchronously fluctuating trees, rather than a few largely fluctuating individuals. These results suggest that pollination efficiency and/or predator satiation hypotheses could be responsible for the masting cycles in this conifer. Ancillary data about limitation of airborne pollen dispersion and temporal variation in the amount of seeds per cone and about seed predator satiation, also support both proposed mechanisms. © 2008 The Authors.",Araucaria araucana; Masting; Pattern; Pollination; Synchronization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37849046136

We studied the foraging activity and fruit production of tomato using one colony of Nannotrigona perilampoides (NP) and one colony of Bombus impatiens (BI) in greenhouses with ?1000 plants. Mechanical vibration (MV) was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations were found between environmental variables and the number of bees entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with BI. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate if increasing densities of colonies of NP could improve tomato yield in tropical greenhouses.",Bombus; Greenhouse; Nannotrigona; Pollination; Tomato; Yucatán,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149026288

To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumble bee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Closely related to synchrony, flowering intensity influences pollinator attraction and pollinator movements. Thus, a high flowering intensity may increase pollinator attraction but, at the same time, may also increase the probability of geitonogamous pollinations. Depending on the mating system, the female fitness of plants in small populations may be affected by both the positive effects of higher flowering synchrony and pollinator attraction and the negative effects of geitonogamous pollinations induced by a high flowering intensity. It was hypothesized that different-sized plants in a population would show contrasting flowering patterns, resulting in differences in pollinator behaviour. These influences could result in differences in mating and female reproductive success. This hypothesis was tested by studying the flowering pattern of Erodium paularense (Geraniaceae), a rare and endangered endemic of central Spain. The temporal distribution of flower production was explored throughout the reproductive season, and the probability of xenogamy and geitonogamy and their relationship to plant size and fitness components were calculated. The analysis of this partially self-compatible species showed diverse flowering patterns related to different plant sizes. Small plants produced a larger number of seeds per fruit in spite of having lower values of flowering synchrony. By contrast, large plants produced a larger number of seeds from geitonogamous pollinations.

Observations in northwestern Alaska appear to support this prediction, where the common Primula eximia possesses reproductive assurance through homostyly and is outpacing the reproduction of its rare, distylous, and pollinator-dependent congener, P. tschuktschorum. We examined the reproductive ecology of these two taxa to determine if P. tschuktschorum is fully distylous with self and intramorph incompatibility, if P. eximia is homostylous with an advantage in fecundity over the rare species, and if there are reproductive interactions between the species. Our results indicate that while P. tschuktschorum is morphologically distylous, it displays only weak incompatibility reactions, but nonetheless has significant reproductive limitations relative to the fecundity of P. eximia, especially in the face of herbivory, which reduces the pool of compatible mates. Some hybridization is occurring between the species. These results support previous suggestions that reproductive assurance may be an important factor limiting the distribution of distyly where pollinator service is unreliable. Homostylous species are likely to be more successful and outcompete distylous progenitors, and selection pressures for reproductive assurance may lessen strong self and intramorph incompatibility reactions in distylous species. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949189639

Here, we investigate the relation between this variation and ecological factors to understand mechanisms governing morph ratios. We estimated morph ratios in 124 populations throughout the range of N. triandrus and measured 13 morphological traits in 35-78 populations. Sampling of morph ratios conducted over 2-10-yr intervals demonstrated strong temporal stability. Variation in floral and vegetative traits enabled statistical prediction of morph-frequency variation among populations. Latitudinal gradients in precipitation and temperature were correlated with plant and flower size, with larger flowers in northern populations associated with bumblebee visitation and stylar dimorphism. Flowers of the L- and M-morphs differed significantly from the S-morph in several size-related characters, unlike other tristylous species. This pattern and the similarity in anther positions of the L- and M-morphs suggest that the M-morph of N. triandrus originated through genetic modifiers that shortened styles of the L-morph.

Subsequently, the male sterility was transferred to B. napus by interspecific hybridization. The hau CMS has stable male sterility. Flowers on the A line are absolutely male sterile, and seeds harvested from the line following pollinations with the maintainer gave rise to 100% sterile progeny. The anthers in CMS plants are replaced by thickened petal-like structures and pollen grains were not detected. In contrast, in other CMS systems viz. pol, nap, tour, and ogu, anthers are formed but do not produce viable pollen. The sterility of hau CMS initiates at the stage of stamen primordium polarization, which is much earlier compared with the other four CMS systems. We have successfully transferred hau CMS from B. juncea to B. napus. Restorer lines for pol, ogu, nap, and tour CMS systems were found to be ineffective to restore fertility in hau CMS. Sixteen out of 40 combinations of mitochondrial probe/enzyme used for RFLP analysis distinguished the hau CMS system from the other four systems. Among these sixteen combinations, five ones alone could distinguish the five CMS systems from each other.

It has been predicted that species that do not require the presence of compatible mates and the services of pollinators for reproduction will be favored in establishment after long-distance dispersal. We tested whether this hypothesis, generally referred to as Baker's law, holds for South African species of Iridaceae (iris family) that have been introduced in other regions for horticultural purposes. Fruit and seed production of flowers from which pollinators had been experimentally excluded was assessed for 10 pairs of species from nine different genera or subgenera. Each species pair comprised one naturalized and one nonnaturalized species, all of which are used in international horticulture. On average, species of Iridaceae that have become naturalized outside their native ranges showed a higher capacity for autonomous fruit and seed production than congeneric species that have not become naturalized. This was especially true for the naturalized species that are considered to be invasive weeds. These results provide strong evidence for the role of autonomous seed production in increasing potential invasiveness in plants. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

Here the effects of pollination and wound-induced ethylene signals on transcript accumulation of benzoyl CoA:benzyl alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (PhBPBT) are shown in Petunia×hybrida cv. Mitchell 'Diploid' (MD). In petunia, PhBPBT is responsible for the biosynthesis of both benzyl benzoate and phenylethyl benzoate from benzyl alcohol and phenylethanol, respectively. RNAi-silenced lines, with reduced PhBPBT transcript, displayed reduced benzyl benzoate emission, and increased benzyl alcohol levels. Detailed expression analysis showed that PhBPBT is regulated by both light and an endogenous circadian rhythm, while it is also differentially regulated in response to ethylene in a tissue-specific manner. Twenty-four hours following pollination of MD flowers, expression of PhBPBT decreases in the corolla, while it increases in the ovary after 48 h. This is caused by ethylene that is emitted from the flower coinciding with fertilization as this is not observed in transgenic ethylene-insensitive plants (CaMV35S::etr1-1; 44568). Ethylene is also emitted from vegetative tissue of petunia following mechanical wounding, resulting in an increase in PhBPBT expression in the leaves where expression is normally below detection levels. Indicative of this pattern of expression, we hypothesize that PhBPBT and subsequent benzyl benzoate production is involved in defence-related processes in the corolla prior to pollination, in the ovary immediately following fertilization, and in vegetative tissue in response to wounding. © 2008 The Author(s).",Benzenoids; Benzyl benzoate; Ethylene; Floral volatiles; Petunia hybrida; Wounding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149124605

In contrast to other reward-producing structures such as nectaries, the anatomy of the elaiophore and the process of oil secretion have not been extensively studied. In this paper, elaiophore structure is described for two members of Oncidiinae, Oncidium trulliferum Lindl. and Ornithophora radicans (Rchb.f.) Garay & Pabst. • Methods: Elaiophores of both species were examined using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. • Key Results and Conclusions: In flowers of Oncidium trulliferum and Ornithophora radicans, oil is secreted by morphologically distinct elaiophores associated with the labellar callus. However, in O. trulliferum, elaiophores also occur on the lateral lobes of the labellum. In both these species, the epithelial elaiophores are composed of a single layer of palisade-like epidermal cells and a distinct subepithelial layer. Secretory elaiophore cells may contain numerous, starchless plastids, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum profiles. In O. trulliferum, the cytoplasm contains myelin-like figures but these are absent from O. radicans. In the former species, cavities occur in the cell wall and these presumably facilitate the passage of oil onto the elaiophore surface. In O. radicans, the accumulation of oil between the outer tangential wall and the cuticle causes the latter to become distended. Since it is probable that the full discharge of oil from the elaiophores of O. radicans occurs only when the cuticle is ruptured by a visiting insect, this may contribute towards pollinator specificity. The structure of the elaiophore in these species resembles both that found in previously investigated species of Oncidiinae and that of certain members of the Malpighiaceae. © The Author 2007.

We compared the foraging activity and fruit production of habanero pepper. Capsicum chinense Jacquin, by using N. perilampoides and Bombus impatiens Cresson in pollination cages. Both bee species collected pollen on a similar number of flowers per unit time, but N. perilampoides visited significantly more flowers per trip, lasted longer on each flower, and spent more time per foraging trip. Ambient temperature and light intensity significantly affected the foraging activity of N. perilampoides. Light intensity was the only environmental variable that affected B. impatiens. Except for the fruit set, there were not significant differences in the quality of fruit produced by both bee species; however, N. perilampoides and B. impatiens performed better than mechanical vibration for all the variables measured. The abortion of fruit caused the low fruit set produced by B. impatiens, and we speculate it might be due to an excessive visitation rate. Pollination efficiency per visit (Spear's pollination efficiency index) was similar for both bee species in spite of the significantly lower amount of pollen removed by N. perilampoides. We suggested that the highest number of flowers visited per foraging trip coupled with adequate amounts of pollen transported, and transferred between flowers, could explain the performance of N. perilampoides as a good pollinator of habanero pepper.

The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity. These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna. 2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire, UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut, herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type. 3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae, Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop. 4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities, although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity. © 2007 The Authors.",Agri-environment schemes; Functional group; Grass margins; Litter-feeders; Predators; Seed mix; Soil disturbance; Soil-feeders,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349118827

Field investigation of the association between sponge gourd, Luffa cylindrica plants and its ant visitors revealed that five of the six most frequent species: Camponotus compressus, C. paria, Pheidole sp., Pachycondyla tesserinoda and Tetramorium sp. mainly visited the extrafloral (EF) nectaries present on the leaves, bracts, bracteoles and calyx of the plant. Tapinoma melanocephalum was the only ant species observed at the floral as well as the EF nectaries. 2. A bioassay of ant behaviour revealed aversion to young and mature unisexual flowers of sponge gourd in the five predominantly EF nectary-visiting ant species, while floral preference was demonstrated in T. melanocephalum. A significant difference was not found in the number of insect pollinators visiting T. melanocephalum occupied and un-occupied flowers, suggesting the absence of deterrent effect of this tiny ant species on the pollinators. 3. Further behavioural assays showed preference for 2- and 4-day-old leaves and also 2-day-old buds, while the 4-day-old buds induced avoidance in all the species. Androecium and gynoecium had significantly higher repellent effects in comparison to the petals. Thus floral repellents, probably help to reduce nectar theft and prevent loss of pollen function. 4. This aversion was not demonstrated in the case of old flowers. A significantly greater number of insect pollinators visited young and mature flowers compared with old flowers, suggesting that selective exclusion of medium- and large-sized EF nectary-visiting ant species from the flowers, as a result of aversion to floral repellents, serves to avoid the threat of attack to insect pollinators of sponge gourd. © 2007 The Royal Entomological Society.",Ant-plant interactions; Ants; Extrafloral nectaries; Floral repellents; Luffa cylindrica; Plant traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349184514

In Arabidopsis these enzymes are encoded by a family of five genes: AtGA20ox1-AtGA20ox5. Transcript analysis indicated that they have different expression patterns and may thus participate differentially in GA-regulated developmental processes. We have used reverse genetics to determine the physiological roles of AtGA20ox1 and AtGA20ox2, the most highly expressed GA20ox genes during vegetative and early reproductive development. AtGA20ox1 and AtGA20ox2 act redundantly to promote hypocotyl and internode elongation, flowering time, elongation of anther filaments, the number of seeds that develop per silique and elongation of siliques, with AtGA20ox1 making the greater contribution to internode and filament elongation, and AtGA20ox2 making the greater contribution to flowering time and silique length. Pollination of the double mutant with wild-type pollen indicated that the GA promoting silique elongation is of maternal origin. The ga20ox2 phenotype revealed that GA promotes the number of stem internodes that elongate upon bolting, and does so independently of its effect on internode elongation. Comparison of the phenotype of the double mutant with that of the highly GA-deficient ga1-3 mutant indicates that other GA20ox genes contribute to all the developmental processes examined, and, in some cases such as root growth and leaf expansion, make major contributions, as these processes were unaffected in the double mutant. In addition, the effects of the mutations are mitigated by the homeostatic mechanism that acts on expression of other GA dioxygenase and GID1 receptor genes. © 2007 The Authors.",Arabidopsis development; GA 20-oxidase; GA mutants; Gene expression; Gibberellin biosynthesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849207842

Mutations in Mn1 result in numerous changes that include a small kernel phenotype resulting from both decreased cell size and number. To explore the pleiotropic effects of this mutation, we investigated the levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA) in basal regions, upper regions, and embryos of developing kernels in the inbred line W22. We measured phytohormones from 6 to 28 days after pollination (DAP) in wild type (WT) and two alleles of mn1, mn1-1 and mn1-89. IAA was the predominant hormone in kernels, with WT levels of free IAA accumulating over time to more than 2 ?g/g of fresh weight. Kernels of mn1-1 accumulated up to 10-fold less IAA than WT, and levels of IAA sugar conjugates were similarly reduced. Although less abundant, differences were also observed in levels of ABA, JA, and SA between WT and the mn1 alleles. SA levels were increased by as much as 10-fold in mn1-1, and mn1-89 displayed intermediate SA levels at most timepoints.

Based on morphological assessment, the material comprised 51 putative hybrids, 18 putative R. ferrugineum individuals and 26 putative R. hirsutum plants. RAPD data were analysed using a Bayesian approach implemented by the program newhybrids, and also by principal coordinates analysis. The identity of all R. ferrugineum plants examined was confirmed; however, of the putative R. hirsutum individuals examined, two were certainly and 11 possibly hybrid derivatives. Among all hybrid derivatives examined, about half were designated as F 1s or a similar class, otherwise backcrosses to R. hirsutum appeared to be common whereas other hybrid classes were rare and backcrosses to R. ferrugineum possibly absent. Despite this, artificially generated seed of F 2class and backcrosses in each direction showed greater viability than one parent (R. hirsutum). Introgression from R. ferrugineum was also detected in a population that from morphology appeared to contain only R. hirsutum. Hence, the direction of backcrossing might be highly asymmetric within hybrid zones, causing unidirectional gene flow from R. ferrugineum into R. hirsutum. Conversely, the rarity of backcrosses to R. ferrugineum, F 2s and later hybrid generations, which might be due to phenology effects and habitat-mediated selection, could play a part in restricting gene flow towards R. ferrugineum. © 2008 The Authors.",F1 frequency; Hybrid zone; Introgression; Rhododendron ferrugineum; Rhododendron hirsutum; Species barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38849162797

All species showed uniform development typical for the Opuntioideae. Ovule development proceeds acropetally, but shows developmental asynchrony across floral morphs. At anthesis, female morph ovules are functional and available for fertilization, whereas staminate flower ovules are senescing and incapable of being fertilized. In occasional plants of some species, staminate flowers may reach anthesis with a few functional apical ovules capable of seed formation. Such plants are described as inconstant/leaky males. Ovule fertility differences across morphs are interpreted as resulting from heterochronic ovule development and senescence, although variation in embryo sac longevity cannot be ruled out. Significantly, ovule abortion follows a common pattern and timing in staminate flowers of both male morphs in all species. Thus, on the basis of this uniformity, a common origin for the cryptically dioecious breeding system in Consolea is hypothesized. Furthermore, staminate expression in Consolea appears to be controlled by a common, genetically determined heterochronic ovule developmental programme affecting the relative timing of ovule receptivity and flower opening.

The effects of multiple antagonists to plant reproduction may not be predictable from studying their individual effects in isolation. If consumer behaviors are contingent on each other, such interactions may limit the ability of the host to evolve in response to any one enemy. Here, we asked whether nectar robbing by a bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis) altered the likelihood of pre-dispersal seed predation by a fly (Hylemya sp.) on a shared host plant, Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae). We estimated the fitness consequences of the combined interactions using experimental manipulations of nectar robbing within and among sites. Within sites, nectar robbing reduced the percentage of fruits destroyed by Hylemya. However, the negative effects of robbing on seed production outweighed any advantages associated with decreased seed predation in robbed plants. We found similar trends among sites when we manipulated robbing to all plants within a local population, although the results were not statistically significant.

We examined the expression patterns of all four GA3ox genes in Arabidopsis thaliana by promoter-?-glucuronidase gene fusions and by quantitative RT-PCR and defined their physiological roles by characterizing single, double, and triple mutants. In developing flowers, GA3ox genes are only expressed in stamen filaments, anthers, and flower receptacles. Mutant plants that lack both GA3ox1 and GA3ox3 functions displayed stamen and petal defects, indicating that these two genes are important for GA production in the flower. Our data suggest that de novo synthesis of active GAs is necessary for stamen development in early flowers and that bioactive GAs made in the stamens and/or flower receptacles are transported to petals to promote their growth. In developing siliques, GA3ox1 is mainly expressed in the replums, funiculi, and the silique receptacles, whereas the other GA3ox genes are only expressed in developing seeds. Active GAs appear to be transported from the seed endosperm to the surrounding maternal tissues where they promote growth. The immediate upregulation of GA3ox1 and GA3ox4 after anthesis suggests that pollination and/or fertilization is a prerequisite for de novo GA biosynthesis in fruit, which in turn promotes initial elongation of the silique. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249147057

With restoration increasingly key to global conservation, it is important to understand the landscape attributes and bird community characteristics that most influence avian seed dispersal in human-altered landscapes. We examined bird community structure and seed-dispersal patterns in agricultural countryside in Costa Rica that is typical of much of the Neotropics. Contrary to expectations, bird abundance, not richness, best predicted the richness of bird-dispersed seeds. Neither forest patch size or proximity, nor total tree cover, influenced seed dispersal. The richness and abundance of dispersed seeds, however, was strongly correlated with ""wetness,"" a remotely-sensed metric of vegetation, at several scales. These results suggest that in this human-dominated tropical region: (1) bird abundance, not species richness or size, may drive seed dispersal, and (2) remote-sensing combined with field verification can detect landscape elements that are helpful for maintaining the option of bird-mediated reforestation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In Iowa these remnants are typically either block-shaped or long, linear strips along transportation routes. In this study we examined differences in the butterfly, bee, and forb community composition in linear and block prairie remnants, determined correlations between species diversity among butterflies, bees and forbs in the 20 prairie remnants sampled, and examined correlations of community similarity among butterflies, bees and forbs. Correspondence analysis showed that distinct communities exist for butterflies and forbs in block versus linear sites and discriminant analysis showed that the bee and forb communities in block and linear sites can be distinguished on the basis of a few species. Diversity of one group was a poor predictor of diversity in another, except for a significant inverse relationship between bees and butterflies. These two pollinator taxa may be responding very differently to microhabitat components within fragmented ecosystems. Our studies show that there need to be differences in conservation strategies for bees and butterflies to maintain both pollinator communities. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.",Bees; Butterflies; Correspondence analysis; Cross-taxon congruence; Prairies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37549025328

Results obtained from this investigation showed that the pollen shape is spheroidal in G. nigritiana, E. praetermissa and C. odorata while it is elliptic in V. guineensis and L. pterodonta. The pollen aperture is porate in all except in L. pterodonta where it is elliptic. The pollen wall is echinate in all except in C. odorata where it is smooth. The general appearance of the pollen grains is circular in G. nigritiana, E. praetermissa and C. odorata but longer than wide in V. guinensis and L. pterodonta. It is therefore likely that the nature of the pollen grains in these species could be an evolutionary modification often inherited to determine the mode of pollination and thereby perpetuate a particular group of plants.

Emasculation can be avoided and labour saved if male sterile line is used as the female parent. Efforts were made to incorporate functional male sterility conditioned by ps2 gene and sporogenic male sterility conditioned by ms2 and ms33 genes into locally adapted and horticulturally superior genotypes. The lines viz. 'ps2 L 3841', 'ps2 NS 101' 'ps2 San Pedro' and 'ps2 UC 82-B' (all functional male sterile); and 'ms2 IPA' and 'ms33 IPA' (both sporogenic male sterile) were stabilized after six cycles of alternate selfing and backcrossing. It is suggested that the utility of functional male sterile lines can be enhanced if it is combined with exserted stigma conditioned by the gene ex. The stigma position of 'ms33 IPA' is exserted and is, therefore, accessible for hand-pollination for F 1 hybrid seed production without disturbing the anther cone. It was estimated that while using 'ms33 IPA' as a female parent, 54.4 per cent time was saved over its fertile counterpart for F 1 hybrid seed production.

Paternity analysis using six microsatellite loci identified a pollen source for 45% of seedlings, and the remainder were assumed to have arisen from pollen sources outside the stands. Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89%, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve. Similarity of direct and indirect historical estimates of gene flow indicates maintenance of gene flow at levels experienced prior to fragmentation.

Total RNA was extracted from leaf samples collected at different times from both inoculated and noninoculated seedlings, and expression of the pathogenesis-related proteins PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, PR-8, PR-10 and chitinase was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot hybridisation. Disease severity was significantly lower on seedlings treated with ProCa than on the water-treated control seedlings. ProCa triggered a general increase in gene expression of almost all the PR genes; only the level of chitinase and PR-10 did not show a detectable increase. A strong upregulation of all the assayed genes was observed in leaves of apple seedlings first treated with ProCa and then inoculated with the pathogen, whereas no expression and/or a constitutive signal was found in samples from the control seedlings. © 2007 Association of Applied Biologists.",Dioxygenase inhibitor; Gene expression; Malus domestica; Pathogenesis-related proteins; Venturia inaequalis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38549162045

Europe is currently struggling to implement coherent coexistence regulations in all EU Member States. Since the publication of the European Commission's guidelines in 2003, some Member States have developed, and others are still developing, a diversity of ex ante regulations and ex post liability rules on the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops. In this article, our attention is drawn to ex ante regulations. More specifically, we polarize two alternative ways of regulating spatial coexistence, i.e. rigid minimum distance rules, imposed on GM crop production, versus flexible segregation measures such as buffer zones, leaving more freedom of negotiation between neighboring farmers. We conduct simulations with the software ArcView® on a GIS dataset of a hypothetical case of GM herbicide tolerant oilseed rape cultivation in Central France. Our findings show that rigid coexistence rules, such as large distance requirements, may impose a severe burden on GM crop production in Europe. These rules are not proportional to the farmers' basic economic incentives for coexistence and hence not consistent with the objectives of the European Commission. More alarming, we show that in densely planted areas a domino-effect may occur, a theoretical possibility ignored in the literature. This effect raises coexistence costs and even adds to the non-proportionality of rigid coexistence regulations. Instead, we show that flexible measures would be preferable since they are proportional to the economic incentives for coexistence and, hence, less counterproductive for European agriculture. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Box 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224, United States","The timing of life history traits is central to lifetime fitness and nowhere is this more evident or well studied as in the phenology of flowering in governing plant reproductive success. Recent changes in the timing of environmental events attributable to climate change, such as the date of snowmelt at high altitudes, which initiates the growing season, have had important repercussions for some common perennial herbaceous wildflower species. The phenology of flowering at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA) is strongly influenced by date of snowmelt, which makes this site ideal for examining phenological responses to climate change. Flower buds of Delphinium barbeyi, Erigeron speciosus, and Helianthella quinquenervis are sensitive to frost, and the earlier beginning of the growing season in recent years has exposed them to more frequent mid-June frost kills. From 1992 to 1998, on average 36.1% of Helianthella buds were frosted, but for 1999-2006 the mean is 73.9%; in only one year since 1998 have plants escaped all frost damage. For all three of these perennial species, there is a significant relationship between the date of snowmelt and the abundance of flowering that summer. Greater snowpack results in later snowmelt, later beginning of the growing season, and less frost mortality of buds. Microhabitat differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt patterns, and cold air drainage during frost events can be significant; an elevation difference of only 12 m between two plots resulted in a temperature difference of almost 2°C in 2006 and a difference of 37% in frost damage to buds. The loss of flowers and therefore seeds can reduce recruitment in these plant populations, and affect pollinators, herbivores, and seed predators that previously relied on them. Other plant species in this environment are similarly susceptible to frost damage so the negative effects for recruitment and for consumers dependent on flowers and seeds could be widespread. These findings point out the paradox of increased frost damage in the face of global warming, provide important insights into the adaptive significance of phenology, and have general implications for flowering plants throughout the region and anywhere climate change is having similar impacts. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Delphinium barbeyi; Erigeron speciosus; Flowering; Frost; Growing season; Helianthella quinquenervis; Phenology; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Snowmelt, subalpine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42249114531

Although the moth-yucca mutualism is often studied as a pairwise interaction, yucca plants are also the sole host for a variety of other visitors. One of these additional visitors is a stem-boring moth, Prodoxus quinquepunctellus. 2. In this study, it is shown how the reproductive success of Prodoxus indirectly depends on the interactions between yuccas and their pollinators (Tegeticula, Prodoxidae) as well as the indirect effects of ants and aphids. 3. Aggressive wood ants foraging on yuccas will attack adult Prodoxus moths while attempting to oviposit. This reduces the number of eggs laid in yucca stalks, leading to fewer larvae feeding in the stalks. 4. Once in the stalk, the survival of Prodoxus eggs/larvae depends upon the rate at which the flowering stalks dry out during fruit maturation. Portions of the stalk above the highest fruit dry out quickly and survivorship approaches zero in these dry sections, while larvae in green sections of the flowering stalk have significantly higher survival rates. The presence of aphids feeding on the stalk slows down the rate of stalk drying and could lead to increased survival of Prodoxus larvae. 5. Overall, ants have strong indirect effects on P. quinquepunctellus by controlling how many eggs are laid in the stalk and by influencing the distribution of aphids. However, it is primarily the presence and position of the fruit that can affect larval survivorship, and fruit position is a function of pollinator visits and resource limitation. These complex interactions illustrate the importance of studying the yucca-moth mutualism in a community context. © 2008 The Royal Entomological Society.",Formicinae; Larval survivorship; Moth; Mutualism; Resource-limited fruit production; Yucca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349103660

Due to its low N harvest index (HI) and to favourable soil conditions after harvest, large amounts of mineral N remain in the soil, which cannot completely be taken up by the subsequent wheat crop. This increases the risk of N leaching into the groundwater during the following winter. Recently, semi-dwarf genotypes of OSR were developed and made commercially available that show similar yields but reduced height growth compared to conventional genotypes. The present authors hypothesized that the introduction of dwarfing genes leads to an increase in HI for dry matter (DM) and for N of OSR. As a consequence, semi-dwarf genotypes would accumulate less aerial biomass, return fewer plant residues to the soil and need less N to achieve yield maximum compared to conventional hybrids or open pollinating varieties. This may lead to a reduced risk of N leaching after growing OSR. In order to test this hypothesis, field trials conducted in 2003/04-2005/06 near Kiel in NW Germany combined four commercial varieties of OSR (Express, Talent, Trabant and Belcanto as semi-dwarf genotype), two seeding dates (mid-August and beginning of September) and eight mineral N fertilization rates (0-240 kg N/ha). On average in 2003/04-2004/05, the semi-dwarf genotype Belcanto achieved significantly less seed yield (4.44 t/ha) than the other varieties (4.65-4.88 t/ha). However, all varieties tested required similar N fertilization to achieve maximum yield. In addition, N offtake by the seeds did not differ. No interaction between genotype and N treatment was observed. Detailed analysis of DM accumulation and N uptake during the growth period revealed only small differences between the varieties in the averages of all N treatments and both years. At harvest, Belcanto produced more pods/m2 and a slightly higher 1000 seed weight. Nevertheless, HI and N HI were similar for all genotypes. It is concluded that, despite its lower plant height, the semi-dwarf genotype did not provide the opportunity to reduce the risk of N leaching after growing OSR. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37349018819

This diversity has resulted from gene duplication and neofunctionalization of the enzymes that synthesize and subsequently modify terpenes. Two diterpene synthases in Norway spruce (Picea abies), isopimaradiene synthase and levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase, provide the hydrocarbon precursors for most of the diterpene resin acids found in the defensive oleoresin of conifers. Although these paralogous enzymes are 91% identical at the amino acid level, one is a single-product enzyme, whereas the other is a multiproduct enzyme that forms completely different products. We used a rational approach of homology modeling, protein sequence comparison, domain swapping, and a series of reciprocal site-directed mutagenesis to identify the specific residues that direct the different product outcomes. A one-amino acid mutation switched the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase into producing isopimaradiene and sandaracopimaradiene and none of its normal products. Four mutations were sufficient to reciprocally reverse the product profiles for both of these paralogous enzymes while maintaining catalytic efficiencies similar to the wild-type enzymes. This study illustrates how neofunctionalization can result from relatively minor changes in protein sequence, increasing the diversity of secondary metabolites important for conifer defense. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Biochemical evolution; Natural product biosynthesis; Plant defense; Site-directed mutagenesis; Terpene diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949096144

These mites undergo their life histories quickly in spike or spadix inflorescences of their plant hosts in lowland tropical rainforests, where they apparently feed on nectar or pollen. One inflorescence may bear hundreds of the developing mites in all instars. Pollen is found on all instars of these mites, which may act as miniature pollinators of their plant hosts. Adult males are strongly sexually dimorphic, with bizarrely modified setae peripherally on the body dorsum and on dorsal surfaces of the legs. These structures are thought to be used competitively for mates, in much the same way as in males of the related hummingbird flower mite genera Rhinoseius and Tropicoseius. Spadiseius calyptrogynae sp. nov. lives in inflorescences of a palm, Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana, and has a phoretic association both with perching bats of the genus Artibeus, which are major pollinators of this plant, and scarab beetles of the genus Lagochile, which feed destructively on flowers of this plant. Spadiseius spathiphyllae sp. nov. lives in inflorescences of an aroid, Spathiphyllum friedrichsthalli, and is phoretic on meliponine bees of the genus Trigona that pollinate this plant. Polymorphism among adult males occurs in both species. In male S. calyptrogynae a ""warty"" ornamentation of the dorsal shield seems to be correlated with extreme elongation of certain body and leg setae, while in male S. spathiphyllae such disproportionate setal elongation seems correlated with more robust individuals of greater body and leg dimensions. Several newly recognized morphological attributes are noted among species of Spadiseius, including apically forked salivary styli.

Secretory cavities located adjacent to the epidermis of sepals, petals, receptacle, stamens, ovary and style show both a schizolysigenous, a combination of schizogenous and lysigenous development. At maturity, the glands are made up of a sheath of flattened cells; secretory cells are completely degenerated. The presence of lipids, terpenes and phenolics identified in the secretory lumen may be linked to different ecological functions especially depending on the organ where glands are distributed. Unicellular papillae are located on the upper surface of the ovary close to the base of the stamens. They do not seem to form a nectary, but phenolic production by parenchymal cells beneath them could be linked to the production of volatile secretions as attractants for pollinators. Hair trichomes are generally made of a single-basal cell, one stem cell and a cap cell. They are present on the upper surface of the ovary among unicellular papillae.

Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are the most important pollinators of many agricultural crops worldwide and are a key test species used in the tiered safety assessment of genetically engineered insect-resistant crops. There is concern that widespread planting of these transgenic crops could harm honey bee populations. Methodology/Principal Findings. We conducted a meta-analysis of 25 studies that independently assessed potential effects of Bt Cry proteins on honey bee survival (or mortality). Our results show that Bt Cry proteins used in genetically modified crops commercialized for control of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively affect the survival of either honey bee larvae or adults in laboratory settings. Conclusions/Significance. Although the additional stresses that honey bees face in the field could, in principle, modify their susceptibility to Cry proteins or lead to indirect effects, our findings support safety assessments that have not detected any direct negative effects of Bt crops for this vital insect pollinator. © 2008 Duan et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049144745

We provide data to show that early fossil angiosperms were insect-pollinated. Eighty-six percent of 29 extant basal angiosperm families have species that are zoophilous (of which 34% are specialized) and 17% of the families have species that are wind-pollinated, whereas basal eudicot families and basal monocot families more commonly have wind and specialized pollination modes (up to 78%). Character reconstruction based on recent molecular trees of angiosperms suggests that the most parsimonious result is that zoophily is the ancestral state. Combining pollen ornamentation, size, and aperture characteristics and the abundance of single-species pollen clumps of Cenomanian angiospermdispersed pollen species from the Dakota Formation demonstrates a dominance of zoophilous pollination (76% versus 24% wind pollination). The zoophilous pollen species have adaptations for pollination by generalist insects (39%), specialized pollen-collecting insects (27%), and other specialized pollinators (10%). These data quantify the presences of more specialized pollination modes during the mid-Cretaceous angiosperm diversification. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Cretaceous; Floral evolution; Pollen; Pollination biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349121884

In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophyte or pollen tube (PT) [5] carries two nonmotile sperm cells to the female gametophyte (FG) or embryo sac [6] during a long assisted journey through the maternal tissues [7-10]. In Arabidopsis, typically one PT reaches one of the two synergids of the FG (Figure 1A), where it terminates its growth and delivers the sperm cells, a poorly understood process called pollen-tube reception. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the Arabidopsis mutant abstinence by mutual consent (amc). Interestingly, pollen-tube reception is impaired only when an amc pollen tube reaches an amc female gametophyte, resulting in pollen-tube overgrowth and completely preventing sperm discharge and the development of homozygous mutants. Moreover, we show that AMC is strongly and transiently expressed in both male and female gametophytes during fertilization and that AMC functions in gametophytes as a peroxin essential for protein import into peroxisomes. These findings show that peroxisomes play an unexpected key role in gametophyte recognition and implicate a diffusible signal emanating from either gametophyte that is required for pollen-tube discharge. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to its high-cost, this technique allows growers to fix crop load levels and fruit location within the tree canopy. Over three consecutive years we have studied the optimal fruit load for the cultivar 'Fino de Jete' and checked the effects of the vigor of the fruit-bearing shoots and of the fruit position along the shoot on the resulting fruit set and quality. Our results show that yield in well-managed orchards fitted a logarithmic curve with a maximum close to 30 t ha-1 achieved by setting about 400 fruits per adult tree. No significant effects of crop load were detected on fruit size during the first 2 years; in the third year, however, trees with a lower yield produced heavier fruits. An upper limit of 0.22 kg (fresh fruit weight) cm-2 of trunk cross-sectional area is proposed if fruit quality is to be preserved. High yield during three consecutive years did not diminish tree growth. We found no consistent effects of shoot vigor on fruit set and quality. However, a gradient for heavier fruits was observed from the base to the apex of the bearing shoots. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

They are important in the natural landscape, in agriculture and in greenhouses, and have recently come into use in the production of seeds for seed banks. The São Paulo Pollinator Initiative, the CBD, and Pollinator secretariats were important starting points in the international recognition of pollinator importance.

We found that the pollinating bee Braunsapis puangensis breeds within the caulinary domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), an unusual ant-plant that is polymorphic for the presence of domatia and harbours a diverse invertebrate fauna including protective and non-protective ants in its domatia. B. puangensis is the most common flower visitor that carries the highest proportion of H. brunonis pollen. This myrmecophyte is pollen limited and cross-pollinated by bees in the daytime. Hence, the symbiotic pollinator could provide a benefit to trees bearing domatia by alleviating this limitation. We therefore report for the first time an unspecialised mutualism in which a pollinator is housed in a plant structure other than flowers. Here, the cost to the plant is lower than for conventional brood-site pollination mutualisms where the pollinator develops at the expense of plant reproductive structures. Myrmecophytes housing resident pollinators are unusual, as ants are known to be enemies of pollinators, and housing them together may decrease the benefits that these residents could individually provide to the host plant. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Braunsapis puangensis; Domatia; Humboldtia brunonis; Myrmecophyte; Symbiosis; Western Ghats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36648999321

Invasive pollen adhered to pollinators, pollinators switched from Carpobrotus spp. to natives, invasive pollen was transferred to native stigmas, and it affected seed production in one species. Although all possible steps for interference with seed production were found to be qualitatively taken, invasive pollen has probably little impact on the native community because the frequency of invasive pollen transfer to natives was low. However, pollination interactions may change with plant abundance and our study provides evidence that pollen transfer from Carpobrotus spp. to natives does occur and have the potential to affect seed production. We found the species identity of shared pollinators to be of importance, higher flower constancy and lower capacity of pollen adherence are likely to result in less invasive pollen transfer. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present a study conducted in Huanglong Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China, showing that ants of Formicidae, Leptothoras sp. and Paratrechina sp., are principle pollinators of Neottia listeroides (Orchidaceae). The two ant species accounted for dominant floral visitors and transferred most pollinia in the orchid, compared to the role of other insect visitors. The flowering period of N. listeroides in the studied population lasted about 40 days, and most flowers were open from 15th to 26th July. The flower has an open nectariferous furrow on the surface of the labellum which ran down the centre to the bifurcation of the labellum, and produced the minute amount of nectar. While an ant arrived at the base of the labellum following the nectariferous furrow, it could not touch the crest of the rostellum and withdraw the pollinia until it raised its head upwards. Pollinia were often attached to the top of the ant head by the viscid fluid exuded from the touched crest of the rostellum. After being touched the rostellum bent down instantly and blocked the stigma, and then slowly recovered to its original position. The backward movement of the rostellum lasted 17-24 h (21.4±2.1 h, n=42). The temporary inaccessibility of the stigma decreased self-pollination resulting from revisiting of ants. Breeding system experiments showed that this orchid is self-compatible but not autogamous, and that pollination success was dependent on pollinators. The fruit set was 19.77% under natural conditions, indicating that the efficiency of this ant-pollination system is low relative to the high frequency of visitation of ants. The low pollination success of N. listeroides was considered as a result of poor match in morphology between flowers and ants. Moreover, the interaction between N. listeroides and these two ants in Huanglong Valley was suggested as a casual case in a specific period.",Ant pollination; Movement of the rostellum; Nectar; Neottia listeroides; Pollination efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249138701

They differ from typical Cypripedium, such as C. calceolus, in having a broad infolded flap of the lip extending all around the entrance of the pouch (instead of being restricted to the vicinity of the staminode) and in the flap not being slippery. Cypripedium yunnanense is pollinated by Lasioglossum zonulum euronotum (Halictidae), and C. flavum is pollinated by Andrena orchidea and Andrena sp. (Andrenidae, two of nine new hymenopterans discovered at the sites). The bees do not inadvertently fall into the trap by slipping (as often occurs in other slipper orchids), but enter it by crawling down the flap in full control of their movements. No natural hybrids between the two orchids are known, although they occur in close-by or mixed stands, are co-flowering and size compatible with regard to their pollinators, and produce fruits following manual cross-pollination in situ. Analyses of the (non-Cypripedium) pollen carried indicate that: (1) the two andrenids are probably oligolectic; (2) the andrenids and the halictid do not share the same flower species; and (3) the halictid is polylectic. Points (1) and (2) are probable reasons for the lack of hybrids. The other reason why Lasioglossum zonulum euronotum does not visit C. flavum despite being polylectic may be the flower's odour; cases of discrimination of closely related flowers by polylectic Lasioglossum have been reported elsewhere. Blow flies Calliphora vomitoria and Calliphora pattoni (Calliphoridae) also enter the orchids, some smearing themselves with pollen, yet they are not pollinators. They are too large to leave by the exit and die imprisoned. However, they may be accidental pollinators of the rather larger C. tibeticum present at the sites. Such accidental pollinators probably play an important role in the evolution of new pollination syndromes. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Andrena; Bees; Calliphora; Deceptive pollination; Evolution; Flies; Halictidae; Lasioglossum; Oligolecty; Polylecty,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149072317

Behavioural differences between pollinators are likely to influence mating patterns, but few studies have examined this empirically in long-lived, woody, perennials. It was shown previously that outcrossing rates in Grevillea macleayana vary among populations. Here tests were conducted to determine whether the behaviour of birds and honey-bees differed between a population previously found to be highly outcrossed and two inbreeding populations. Methods Visit frequencies and movement patterns of the visitors to inflorescences at three sites over two seasons were compared. A caging experiment was used to test the effects of excluding birds on pollen removal from newly opened flowers and on pollen deposition on stigmas that had been washed clean. Key Results Honey-bees were the most frequent visitors overall, but honeyeaters were more frequent visitors in the population previously found to have a high outcrossing rate than they were in either of the other populations. More visits by honeyeaters were from distant plants. Pollen removal did not vary greatly among sites, and was not affected by bird exclusion; however, more pollen was deposited on the stigmas of cleaned pollen presenters in the population previously observed to be highly outcrossing than in the other two. This high level of pollen deposition was reduced by experimental bird exclusion. Conclusions Honey-bees were the most frequent visitors, by an order of magnitude, and excluding vertebrates revealed that bees were removing most of the pollen but deposited fewer pollen grains on stigmas. Birds were more frequent visitors at the site previously found to be outcrossing than the other two sites, and they moved further between plants and visited fewer inflorescences on a plant during a foraging bout than bees did. These characteristics of bird visits to G. macleayana would be sufficient to produce significant variation in outcrossing rates among sites. © 2009 The Author.",Apis mellifera; Grevillea macleayana; honey-bees; honeyeaters; outcrossing rate; pollen deposition; pollen removal; pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650732893

A conundrum in plant population biology, the frequent apparent overproduction of flowers, is thought to be a response by plant populations to unpredictable pollinator environments, such as those that may be expected at the range limit. We studied pollinator visitation rates and pollen limitation of fruit set in populations of Witheringia solanacea, a widespread bee-pollinated species. We compared two populations in the south and two in the north of Costa Rica, with each region encompassing a lower montane site at the upper elevational limit of the species range with small plant populations, and a premontane site where population densities were high. Populations in the south, where the climate was favorable, had higher pollinator visitation and higher natural fruit set, and showed only minor pollen limitation as compared with northern populations at windy sites near the Continental Divide. Lower montane populations had lower pollinator visitation rates than premontane populations but did not show more pollen limitation of fruit set. In general, pollen limitation was not inversely proportional to pollinator abundance but was higher where the climate is unpredictable. © 2007 The Author(s).",Altitude; Bees; Bet-hedging; Costa Rica; Pollination; Range limits; Solanaceae; Witheringia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149057203

Taxa show specialization for pollination by bees (B. parviflora, B. recurvata), short-proboscid flies (B. galpinii), and long-proboscid flies (B. macroceras, B. coerulea). All species in the genus produce nectar, but some (B. coerulea, B. galpinii) appear to mimic flowers of abundant sympatric species as an additional strategy to attract pollinators. Species investigated in terms of their breeding systems (B. coerulea, B. parviflora, B. macroceras, B. galpinii) are reliant on pollinator visits for seed production. Self-pollination results in strong inbreeding depression during embryo formation. A phylogeny of the genus, constructed using data from the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and morphology, indicates that fly pollination is likely to be basal in the genus, and that there has been a single shift to bee pollination. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Adaptive radiation; Biogeography; Floral syndrome; Internal transcribed spacer (ITS); Madagascar; Nectar; Pollinia; South Africa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149062703

Volcanic gases negatively affect leaf survival and reduce flowering activity in heavily damaged areas. Pollen transfer was sufficient to ensure that higher pollination rates (83%) occurred in heavily damaged areas than in less damaged areas (26-45%), but pollinator densities were lower in response to reduced flower resources. Fruit abortion rates were greater in heavily damaged sites (78%) than in less-damaged sites (53-63%). Consequently, fruit-set rates (16-29%) did not differ significantly among sites. Seed set rates tended to increase with increasing volcanic damage. The negative correlation between seed-set rates and seed mass suggests that the decreased seed mass in severely damaged sites was attributable to the better pollination rates observed there. These results indicate that compensation mechanisms ensure better reproductive success at sites that are more strongly affected by volcanic activity. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Forest recovery system; Maternal reproductive success; Plant-animal interaction; Pollinator behavior; Volcanic island,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149038770

Using data from literature surveys, we compiled a data set of habitat light availability (e.g., canopy vs. understory), pollinator identity, and guild size for 481 angiosperm species representing four broad regions (India, Neotropics, paleotropics, and Canada). Phylogenetic independent contrasts were used to assess the degree to which transitions in canopy position are associated with transitions in the usage of particular pollinators and pollinator guild size. We further examined the degree to which each of these traits tends to be evolutionarily labile versus evolutionarily conserved. Our analysis demonstrates that species that tend to occupy the same position in the canopy are more closely related than expected by chance, as are species that follow traditional pollinator syndromes (e.g., bee or bird), but species that have exceptionally wide pollinator guilds (e.g., are visited by bees, flies, and moths) are widely scattered across the angiosperm phylogeny. Transitions to generalist pollination appeared to be strongly associated with beetle and fly pollination and with position in the canopy above the forest floor. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

This paper studies the pollination ecology of the Asian giant honey bee (Apis dorsata), the Asian dwarf honey bee (Apis florea) and other pollinators on the two prominent plants (Melaleuca cajuputi and Nypa fruticans) in the forests. The results show that the nectar of Melaleuca flowers was secreted in the largest volume with the lowest sugar content in the early morning. Then, due to evaporation, the volume dropped to the lowest with the highest sugar content in the early afternoon. The sugar value present in Melaleuca flowers was the highest (466 Mg of sugar per flower) at 10.00 h in the morning. Nypa flowers opened early in the morning, their pollen release increased gradually, reached a peak at 09.00 h and finished at sunset. The study of pollinators on the Melaleuca and Nypa flowers showed the three following forms of partitioning in the Melaleuca forests: 1. Different plants have different visitors; 2.

Here we test whether pollen susceptibility to rain damage could have played a role in the evolution of the reproductive architecture of Davidia involucrata, an endemic in the mountains of western China. Flowers in this tree species lack a perianth and are arranged in capitula surrounded by large (up to 10 cm x 5 cm) bracts that at anthesis turn from green to white, losing their photosynthetic capability. Flowers are nectarless, and pollen grains are presented on the recurved anther walls for 5-7 days. Flower visitors, and likely pollinators, were mainly pollen-collecting bees from the genera Apis, Xylocopa, Halictus, and Lasioglossum. Capitula with natural or white paper bracts attracted significantly more bees per hour than capitula that had their bracts removed or replaced by green paper. Experimental immersion of pollen grains in water resulted in rapid loss of viability, and capitula with bracts lost less pollen to rain than did capitula that had their bracts removed, suggesting that the bracts protect the pollen from rain damage as well as attracting pollinators. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

HT-B-type proteins are implicated in S-RNase-based self-incompatibility, but the functions of other family members are unknown. Screening for cDNA sequences with an expression pattern similar to HT-B in Nicotiana alata revealed a new group of small HT-family proteins, designated HT-M. HT-M proteins resemble HT-B in several respects: their pistil-specific expression pattern is indistinguishable from HT-B, they pellet with a microsome fraction, and their abundance decreases after pollination. Unlike HT-B, there is no S-specificity to this response, and RNAi experiments show that HT-M proteins are not necessary for self-incompatibility. Identification of a third group of pistil-specific HT-family proteins helps better define the characteristics of the family and allowed identification of putative new family members. By searching the databases with only the most conserved HTfamily sequence elements, the signal sequence and cysteine motifs, we identified nodulin-24-like proteins and several small glycine-rich proteins as putative HT-family members. Like HT-M and HT-B, nodulin-24 is membrane associated. We propose that the conserved features in HT-family proteins are important for targeting or modification and refer to the broader family that includes both HT- and nodulin-24-like proteins as the HT/NOD-24-family. © The Author 2008.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-62249109644

What evolutionary and ecological factors influence the subset of these that a given plant relies on for its pollination? Addressing this question requires a mechanistic understanding of the importance of different potential pollinators in terms of visitation rate (pollinator 'quantity') and effectiveness at transferring pollen (pollinator 'quality') is required. While bat-pollinated plants typically are highly specialized to bats, there are some instances of bat-pollinated plants that use other pollinators as well. These generalized exceptions tend to occur in habitats where bat 'quantity' is poor due to low or fluctuating bat densities. Methods Aphelandra acanthus occurs in tropical cloud forests with relatively high densities of bat visitors, yet displays a mix of floral syndrome characteristics, suggesting adaptation to multiple types of pollinators. To understand its pollination system better, aspects of its floral phenology and the 'quantity' and 'quality' components of pollination by its floral visitors are studied here. Key Results Flowers were found to open and senesce throughout the day and night, although anther dehiscence was restricted to the late afternoon and night. Videotaping reveals that flowers are visited nocturnally by bats and moths, and diurnally by hummingbirds. Analysis of pollen deposition shows that bats regularly transfer large amounts of conspecific pollen, while hummingbirds occasionally transfer some pollen, and moths rarely do so. Conclusions Hummingbirds and bats were comparable in terms of pollination 'quantity', while bats were the most effective in terms of 'quality'. Considering these components together, bats are responsible for approx. 70 % of A. acanthus pollination. However, bats also transferred remarkably large amounts of foreign pollen along with the conspecific grains (three of four grains were foreign). It is suggested that the negative effects of interspecific pollen transfer may decrease bat 'quality' for A. acanthus, and thus select for generalization on multiple pollinators instead of specialization on bats. © 2009 The Author.",bat pollination; chiropterophily; cloud forest; floral syndrome; generalization; heterospecific pollen transfer; hummingbirds; ornithophily; pollinator effectiveness; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650732914

However, the specific ecological and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for transitions from animal to wind pollination are poorly understood in comparison with other major reproductive transitions in angiosperms, including the evolution of selfing from outcrossing and dioecy from hermaphroditism. To investigate correlations between wind pollination and a range of characters including habitat type, sexual system, floral display size, floral showiness, and ovule number, we used a large-scale molecular phylogeny of the angiosperms and maximum likelihood methods to infer historical patterns of evolution. This approach enabled us to detect correlated evolution and the order of trait acquisition between pollination mode and each of nine characters. Log likelihood ratio tests supported a model of correlated evolution for wind pollination and habitat type, floral sexuality, sexual system, flower size, flower showiness, presence versus absence of nectar, and ovule number. In contrast, wind pollination and geographical distribution and number of flowers per inflorescence evolve independently. We found that in wind-pollinated taxa, nectar is lost more often and ovule number is reduced to one. We also found that wind pollination evolves more frequently in lineages already possessing unisexual flowers and/or unisexual plants. An understanding of the ecological and life-history context in which wind pollination originates is fundamental to further investigation of the microevolutionary forces causing transitions from animal to wind pollination. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

In this study we examined this hypothesis, focusing on one of Israel's rarest butterflies, Tomares nesimachus (Rhopalocera; Lycaenidae). The butterfly is affiliated with open grasslands in the north of Israel, where its sole host plant, Astragalus macrocarpus, occurs. In a two-year field study, we mapped the distribution of the butterfly in Israel and tried to evaluate the causes of its rarity and decline. We found that its abundance in habitat patches was correlated with several factors, including (a) fruit production of the host plants in each patch, (b) the number of other patches in the vicinity, (c) the characteristics of the ""matrix"" outside the patches within a distance of up to 2 km, (d) the richness of large bee species (the plant pollinators), and (e) the grazing management of the butterfly's habitat. The characteristics of the matrix further affected the richness of bees in the butterfly's habitat. Since butterfly abundance is correlated with species richness of pollinators, it can serve as an indicator of diverse, species-rich butterfly habitats (grasslands). We deduce that species that depend on fruit production and by themselves do not contribute to their host-plant pollination, may almost necessarily be affected by multiple ecological factors and therefore can indeed serve as good indicators. Our results further indicate that the butterfly's population dynamics are affected by large-scale processes, and hence its conservation requires the preservation of large open landscapes. Consequently, T. nesimachus may also serve as an umbrella species.",Bioindicator; Butterflies; Ecosystem functioning; Grasslands; Grazing management; Pollination service; Tomares nesimachus; Umbrella species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47049099172

However, variation in pollinator abundance over time and space can weaken such selection. In the present study, the variation in pollinator abundance over time and space was examined in populations of the Rocky Mountain columbine. The variation in three floral traits is described and correlations between pollinator type, functional pollinator groups or altitude and floral traits are examined. Methods Pollinator observations took place in six Aquilegia coerulea populations over 1-4 years and spur length, flower colour and sepal length were measured in 12 populations. Pollinator abundance, measured as visits per flower per hour, was compared among populations and years. Pollinators were grouped into two functional groups: pollen or nectar collectors. The following associations were examined: annual presence of hawkmoths and whiter flowers with longer spurs; the presence of Sphinx vashti and longer spurs; and higher altitudes and whiter flowers. The study looked at whether an increase in the proportion of hawkmoths in a population was associated with whiter and larger flowers with longer spurs. Key Results The abundance of different pollinator groups varied over time and space. Floral traits varied among populations. Higher altitude was correlated with bluer flowers. Whiter flowers were associated with the annual presence of hawkmoths. Populations visited by Sphinx vashti had longer spurs than populations visited only by Hyles lineata. Populations with greater percentage of nectar-collecting pollinators did not have whiter, larger flowers with longer spurs. Conclusions Despite the large variation in pollinator abundance over time and space, one species of bumble-bee or hawkmoth tended to predominate in each population each year.

Most studies of this type focus on an unusual class of obligate, species-specific pollination mutualisms. The interaction between Datura wrightii (Solanaceae) and the hawkmoth Manduca sexta offers similar advantages but greater generality. Adult moths both nectar at and deposit eggs on the same plant; larvae are herbivorous. The antagonistic component of this interaction has been well studied. Here the role of M. sexta as a pollinator of D. wrightii, particularly in the context of this moth's frequent nectaring visits to the bat-pollinated plant Agave palmeri, is documented. Methods Hand-pollinations were used to determine breeding system and the reproductive consequences of mixed loads of A. palmeri and D. wrightii pollen. Plants and moths were caged overnight to assess whether nectaring visits led to fruit and seed set. Finally, pollen deposited on field-collected stigmas was identified, with a particular focus on documenting the presence of D. wrightii and A. palmeri grains. Key Results Datura wrightii is highly self-compatible, and a visit that deposits either outcross or self pollen almost doubles fruit and seed set compared with unvisited flowers. Manduca sexta transferred enough pollen to produce fruit and seed sets comparable to hand-pollination treatments. Agave palmeri did not interfere with D. wrightii success: in the field, stigmas received almost pure D. wrightii pollen, and hand-addition of large quantities of A. palmeri pollen had no measurable effect on fruit and seed set. Conclusions The floral visitation component of the D. wrightii-M. sexta interaction is indeed mutualistic. This finding is essential background to future development of this interaction as a model system for studying mutualism's costs and benefits. It is already proving valuable for dissecting third-species effects on the outcome of mutualism.

Because coevolution operates mainly at the population level, reciprocal coadaptations should result in trait covariation among populations of strongly interacting species. A long-tongued fly (Prosoeca ganglbaueri) and its primary floral food plant (Zaluzianskya microsiphon) were studied across both of their geographical ranges. The dimensions of the fly's proboscis and the flower's corolla tube length varied significantly among sites and were strongly correlated with each other. In addition, the match between tube length of flowers and tongue length of flies was found to affect plant fitness. The relationship between flower tube length and fly proboscis length remained significant in models that included various alternative environmental (altitude, longitude, latitude) and allometric (fly body size, flower diameter) predictor variables. We conclude that coevolution is a compelling explanation for the geographical covariation in flower depth and fly proboscis length. © 2007 The Author(s).",Adaptation; Long-proboscid fly; Natural selection; Pairwise coevolution; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37749008223

In addition, two pollen-sterile hybrids of 'Imperial' mandarin X 'Hamlin' sweet orange set seedless fruit when insects were excluded at flowering, but developed seeded fruit in open- pollinated situations, or when controlled cross-pollinations were made. One of these hybrids was used to demonstrate that wind was not a pollen vector. Glasshouse experiments confirmed the results obtained for some of the cultivars tested in the orchard. Variation in anther position relative to the stigma among five cultivars suggested that self- or auto-pollination can occur without vector intervention.

The flowers were visited mainly by two endemic honeyeaters (bellbirds and tui), and in some cases very frequently by silvereyes, which also occasionally rob nectar from flowers. We confirmed that hermaphrodites account for more than half the plants in all populations, are fully self-compatible, and can autonomously self in the absence of pollinators (especially in plants with smaller herkogamy). Fruit production in hermaphrodites and (particularly) females was frequently pollen-limited (mean Pollen Limitation Indices of 0.17 and 0.40, respectively), and was correlated with visual assessments of pollen loads on the stigma, a useful index of pollinator service. A comparison of the proportion of ripe or overripe fruit on branches exposed to birds versus branches enclosed in wire cages showed that uncaged fruit on Kapiti Island is removed almost as soon as it is ripe but on the mainland it persists for much longer. The proportion of ripe or overripe compared to green fruit is therefore an approximate index of dispersal service.

Somatic embryogenesis initiation from zygotic embryos was improved on a medium with lower than standard concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2.2 vs. 9.5 ?M) and 6-benzyladenine (2.2 vs. 4.5 ?M). On this medium, initiation rates of four controlled crosses, including one self-cross, varied from 3% to 25%. Among the maturation factors tested, the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA 80, 120 ?M) had no significant effect on the production of mature somatic embryos when the medium contained 0.1 M sucrose. When sucrose concentration was 0.2 M, however, 1.4 times more mature somatic embryos were produced on medium with 80 ?M compared with 120 ?M ABA. Under our best maturation conditions, mature somatic embryos accumulated amounts of storage proteins that were similar to the amounts in mature zygotic embryos. Activated charcoal exerted a beneficial effect on mature somatic embryo production of 24-week-old cultures; there was no evidence of such an effect in 8-week-old cultures. Thirty-seven embryogenic lines from a self-cross and an out-cross were chosen for clonal plant production. Highly embryogenic lines produced mature somatic embryos that were more likely to convert to plants than those from less embryogenic lines. After 4 months of growth in a shade house, plantlet survival rates exceeded 70% for 31 lines out of 35.

This group of pollinating flies is of particular interest to botanists and pollination biologists. This paper reviews its taxonomy and redescribes its species with the aid of new morphological and molecular data. Molecular evidence supports the group's monophyly, with two sister-clades, the ""aethiopica"" clade (= P. aethiopica) and the ""rondani"" clade (= P. elegans (Bigot), P. rondani (Bertoloni), P. rubiginosa Dias, and P. umbratipennis (Ricardo) stat. rev.). These clades correspond to two species groups defined by male morphology ("" aethiopica"" group = P. aethiopica and P. formosa (Austen); ""rondani"" group = P. elegans, P. rondani, P. rubiginosa, and P. umbratipennis stat. rev.). Molecular evidence also reveals a new character, the index of frons divergence, which is diagnostic for the two clades, and is thus a tool for separating previously indistinguishable females of P. aethiopica from P. rondani. Additionally, I show that some of the longest proboscid specimens, previously confused with P. rondani and P. aethiopica, are actually P. umbratipennis (Ricardo) stat. rev. P. rubiginosa, previously known only from Mozambique, is shown to occur in South Africa, and the male of this species is described for the first time. Furthermore, I show that the distribution of morphotypes within species with differing proboscis lengths is geographically structured, with long-proboscid species occurring only in the Albany Centre of Endemism.",Afrotropical; Horse flies; Identification key; Philoliche; Phylogeny; Pollinators; Tabanidae; Taxonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45949085909

However, the infructescence and berry numbers were not related to the number of inflorescences, and two-fold more seeds were produced by individuals flowering several times than by those flowering just once. Moreover, the reproductive success of this species appeared to be limited by the high abortion rate (50%), strong predation pressure on the inflorescences (34%), and low seed set rate of nonpredated inflorescences (36%), suggesting pollination limitation. Nevertheless, a positive relationship was found between the mean number of Psychoda trapped per inflorescence and the number of maturing infructescences, particularly for the most abundant species, Psychoda crassipenis. Therefore, pollinator availability appeared to be an important limiting factor for fructification in the studied population, by contrast with other studies in which the fruit set appeared to be related more strongly to the density of inflorescences. Such different results may have been caused by the relatively low abundance of Psychoda in the present study. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Fructification; Fruit abortion; Pollinator abundance; Seed set; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149008850

Pollinations were performed among individuals from five diallel crosses and scored for both fruit set and pollen-tube growth to determine the genetic basis of SI. On a subset of these individuals with known cross-(in)compatibility relationships, additional crosses were performed and pistils collected 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after pollination to assess both the percentage of pollen grains that had germinated on the stigma, and the number of pollen tubes that had grown 20%, 40% 60%, 80%, and 100% of the distance down the pistil over five time intervals. Finally, total pistillate proteins were extracted and subjected to isoelectric focusing and RNase activity staining to find evidence of a highly basic S-RNases associated with SI in the Solanaceae. We found evidence that the SI system was based on the haplotype of the male gametophyte, and was not sporophytic. Protein analyses showed that SI was not based on a pistillate S-RNase. The existence of modifiers of SI and possible polyploidy at the S-locus complicated the expression of SI in this species, and single-gene inheritance could not be determined. This represents the first published characterization of incompatibility in the family Campanulaceae. © 2008 NRC.",Breeding system; Coefficient of crossability; Diallel; Partial self-incompatibility; S-RNase; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40449102965

The floral phenology, pollen-ovule ratio (P/O) and floral visitors of O. corniculata were investigated and determined. Assisted pollination experiments were carried out to examine the breeding system of O. corniculata. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and fluorescence microscope (FM) were employed to examine pollen germination and the growth of pollen tubes. The species is composed of three floral morphs in China, viz., the long-styled morph, the semi-homostyled morph, and the quasi-homostyled morph. The semi-homostyled morph is common in disturbed urban and ruderal habitats, whereas only one long-styled population was found in less disturbed habitats of Pinus forests in Anning County, Yunnan Province, although two specimens (in IBSC) of long-styled individuals collected from a same locality in Guangdong Province were also recorded. The flowering period of O. corniculata was from February to November, with a peak at March to September; the longevity of a single flower was two days, and the petals closed at the first night and reopen in the next morning. Pollen grains were found on self-stigmata, and the pollen grains were germinating on the stigmata before the flower opening. The P/O was 83.3±33.08. Nectar secretion was observed but the volume was not large enough to be measured. A small butterfly (Pseudozizeeria sp.) was observed to visit the flowers of semi-homostyled plants, but its effectiveness as a pollinator was extremely low. Fruit set of untreated bagged flowers (88.12±3.38) was not significantly different from that of open flowers (88.03±2.48). Fluorescence microscopic (FM) observations proved that pollen germinated on self-stigmata and pollen tubes grown in self-styles. Measurements of floral traits and results of manipulated pollination treatments indicated that the breeding system of semi-homostyled plants of the species is typical autogamy.",Autogamy; Floral morph; Heterostyly; Oxalis corniculata; Pollination; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249122430

In total, 1,145 individual bees, representing 54 species (13% of the recorded New York State bee fauna) were collected over 4 yr. The nesting habits of these species include bees that nest in cavities (33% of species), hives (11% of species), pith (1.9% of species), wood (1.9% of species), or soft/rotting wood (7.4% of species) substrates. Soil-nesting individuals were relatively rare (25% of individuals), perhaps due to a lack of proper soils for nesting sites. Parasitic species were scarce (5.6% of species, 2.6% of individuals), most likely because of an absence or rarity of host species. Overall, exotic species were abundant and constituted 27% of the total individuals collected and 19% of the identified species. We compare these results to several bee faunal surveys in New Jersey and New York State, including newly reported species lists for Central Park and Prospect Park in New York City. Relative to other studies bee richness of the urban gardens is reduced and composition is biased toward exotic and cavity-nesting species. Nevertheless, despite their small size and location within highly urbanized areas, urban community gardens harbor a diverse assemblage of bees that may provide pollination services and opportunities for ecological exposure and education. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.",Community gardens; Insect survey; Invasive species; Pollinator conservation; Urban ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049156324

The role of phytohormones in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit set was investigated here. • Transcriptome analysis of ovaries was performed using two complementary approaches: cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microarray analysis. • The gene expression profiles obtained suggest that, in addition to auxin and gibberellin, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) are involved in regulating fruit set. Before fruit development, many genes involved in biotic and abiotic responses are active in the ovary. In addition, genes involved in ethylene and ABA biosynthesis were strongly expressed, suggesting relatively high ethylene and ABA concentrations before fruit set. Induction of fruit development, either by pollination or by gibberellin application, attenuated expression of all ethylene and ABA biosynthesis and response genes within 24 h. • It is proposed that the function of ABA and ethylene in fruit set might be antagonistic to that of auxin and gibberellin in order to keep the ovary in a temporally protected and dormant state; either to protect the ovary tissue or to prevent fruit development before pollination and fertilization occur. © The Authors (2007).",Dormancy; Hormonal cross-talk; Ovary transcriptome analysis; Phytohormones; Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36849079444

However, the difficulty in obtaining HL seeds limits the production of seedlings for reforestation. Both European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi [Lamb.] Carrière) produce few seeds and the time lag in their flowering phenology complicates their natural pollination. We have developed a novel type of sheltered seed orchard, dedicated to the production of HL seeds from grafts grown in pots. Inverting the arches of a conventional tunnel provides a sturdy structure which is easy to maintain. Because of its height, the tunnel can accommodate the rapid growth of the trees, which reduces the need for pruning. The tunnels are covered in the winter and spring. In the winter, the covers prevent snow accumulation. In the spring, they create a ""greenhouse effect"" inside the tunnels, accelerating flower development, preventing pollen contamination from trees outside the tunnels and protecting the flowers from late spring frosts. Over the past five years, flowering has been regular and abundant. Bagging the crowns for pollen harvest is cost-effective and yields large quantities of high quality pollen. Pollination operations are conducted using an electrostatic pistol. Because of the large number of available clones, large quantities of seeds with a high genetic variability can be produced at a competitive cost. In 2006, this seed orchard concept was implemented operationally at the Berthier forest nursery (Québec, Canada).",Electrostatic pollination; European larch (Larix decidua Mill.); Indoor seed orchard; Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi [Lamb.] Carrière); Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149159673

Prominent among these is its role as a land bridge for the migration and differentiation of species during the Pleistocene, as a consequence of the lowering of sea level and climate changes associated with the Ice Ages. In the present study, we report a multilevel hierarchical investigation of the genetic diversity of Calicotome villosa, a common pioneer legume shrub, at the regional scale. The results of genetic analysis of progeny arrays are consistent with a predominantly outcrossing mating system in all the populations analysed. Geographically, a pattern of population isolation by distance was found, but the Strait accounted for only approximately 2% of the among-population genetic differentiation. Consequently, extensive historical gene flow appears to be the rule for this species in this area. According to the natural history traits of C. villosa (pollination, dispersal, and colonization ability), we hypothesize that gene flow must be strongly influenced by seed dispersal because pollen flow is very limited. Based on the history of trade and land use, cattle and human movements across the Strait must have strongly favoured seed dispersal. We review and discuss these results and compare them with those of other reported studies of genetic and phylogenetic differentiation across the Strait of Gibraltar. It is stressed that colonization ability, which depends upon seed dispersal and life form, can be a more critical factor in gene flow than pollination. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Allozymes; Breeding system; Colonization; Dispersal; Gene flow; Legume; Mediterranean biogeography; Population genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249016341

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of the morning glory Ipomoea purpurea alters patterns of selection on floral traits of its congener, Ipomoea hederacea. We show that while selection on I. hederacea floral traits is effectively neutral when I. purpurea flowers are absent, selection acts to increase clustering of anthers about the stigma when I. purpurea flowers are present. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that the presence of flowers of a co-occurring congener can influence patterns of natural selection on floral traits that influence the mating system and contribute to prezygotic isolation. To the extent that this result is general, it also lends support to the claim that distributional patterns interpreted as ecological and reproductive character displacement in other plant species have been caused by natural selection generated by interactions among plant species. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

Our phylogenetic study was based on 133 taxa using 3?-ETS and ITS, and on data on morphology, karyology, distribution, and ecological preferences. We compared Arctic lineages with sister groups and tested whether patterns were significantly different. We found: (1) Artemisia has independently adapted to Arctic habitats 13-18 times; (2) There were no ecological preferences of putative progenitors that might determine the colonization success in the Arctic, although most sister groups were centered in steppe habitats; (3) Plant height was distinctly reduced in Arctic lineages; (4) Arctic lineages contained no more polyploids than their respective sister groups or taxa from other habitats; (5) Enlarged flower heads have evolved repeatedly, probably for better pollinator attraction. This strategy could be a substitute for polyploidy, which is typical in other Arctic taxa. Stronger pollinator attraction should result in better outcrossing and higher heterozygosity in the offspring, which is among the main effects of polyploidy. © 2007 The Author(s).",Arctic; Artemisia; Beringia; Intercontinental dispersal; Pollination; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37749033276

Previous studies in vitro showed that nitric oxide (NO) works as a negative chemotropic cue for pollen tube growth in lily (Lilium longiflorum). Furthermore, Arabidopsis thaliana Atnos1 mutant plants, which show defective NO production, have reduced fertility. Here, we focus in the role of NO in the process of pollen-pistil communication, using Arabidopsis in-vivo and lily semi-vivo assays. Cross-pollination between wild-type and Atnos1 plants shows that the mutation affects the pistil tissues in a way that is compatible with abnormal pollen tube guidance. Moreover, DAF- 2DA staining for NO in kanadi floral mutants showed the presence of NO in an asymmetric restricted area around the micropyle. The pollen-pistil interaction transcriptome indicates a time-course-specific modulation of transcripts of AtNOS1 and two Nitrate Reductases (nr1 and nr2), which collectively are thought to trigger a putative NO signaling pathway. Semivivo assays with isolated ovules and lily pollen further showed that NO is necessary for micropyle targeting to occur. This evidence is supported by CPTIO treatment with subsequent formation of balloon tips in pollen tubes facing ovules. Activation of calcium influx in pollen tubes partially rescued normal pollen tube morphology, suggesting that this pathway is also dependent on Ca2+ signaling. A role of NO in modulating Ca2+ signaling was further substantiated by direct imaging the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration during NO-induced re-orientation, where two peaks of Ca 2+ occur-one during the slowdown/stop response, the second during re-orientation and growth resumption. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the participation of NO signaling events during pollen-pistil interaction. Of special relevance, NO seems to directly affect the targeting of pollen tubes to the ovule's micropyle by modulating the action of its diffusible factors. © The Author 2008.",Calcium signaling; Fertilization; Guidance; NO; Pollen tubes,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549099148

To recognize patterns of homology, we dissected the floral symmetry character complex and explored corolla morphology in 60 Senna species and studied floral development of four enantiomorphic species. The asymmetry morph of a flower is correlated with the direction of spiral calyx aestivation. We recognized five patterns of floral asymmetry, resulting from different combinations of six structural elements: deflection of the carpel, deflection of the median abaxial stamen, deflection or modification in size of one lateral abaxial stamen, and modification in shape and size of one or both lower petals. Prominent corolla asymmetry begins in the earl-stage bud (unequal development of lower petals). Androecium asymmetry begins either in the midstage bud (unequal development of thecae in median abaxial stamen; twisting of androecium) or at anthesis (stamen deflection). Gynoecium asymmetry begins in early bud (primordium off the median plane, ventral slit laterally oriented) or midstage to late bud (carpel deflection). In enantiostylous flowers, pronouncedly concave and robust petals of both monosymmetric and asymmetric corollas likely function to ricochet and direct pollen flow during buzz pollination.

We found significant odour differences, but contrary to expectations, both species showed a rhythmic emission of the same compounds between day and night. Second, in a field experiment, odour of the two species was made more similar by applying phenylacetaldehyde to flowers. This manipulation led to higher pollen-analogue transfer between species, revealing that floral odour differences are important for maintaining reproductive isolation.

Recent studies have suggested that a diverse range of internal and external factors, signaling components and their related pathways are likely involved in pollen fertility. Here, we report a single C2-domain containing protein, OsPBP1, initially identified through cDNA microarray analysis. OsPBP1 is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but downregulated by pollination. OsPBP1 had a calcium concentration-dependent phospholipid-binding activity and was localized mainly in cytoplasm and nucleus, but translocated onto the plasma membrane in response to an intracellular Ca21 increase. Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility. OsPBP1 protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination. Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca21 and phospholipid signaling pathways. © The Author 2008.",C2-domain; OsPBP1; Phospholipid; Pollen fertility; Pollination; Rice (Oryza sativa L.),Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749107883

It is an aroid species, which grows in vigorous, relatively small and dense populations, consisting of phenotypically uniform or very similar individuals. The most variable traits observed in wild populations are number of inflorescences, number of infructescences per plant, and corm length. These traits are highly variable even within genetically uniform populations and are highly influenced by age differences between plants. Flowering is frequent and most of the plants are highly fertile. However, sexual reproduction is rare due to self-incompatibility (between plants genetically homogeneous within the same population) and the absence of efficient pollinators. Self-incompatibility can be partly overcome by repeated self-pollination. Thermogenesis was studied on a large sample of inflorescences and little variation concerning the thermogenic potential was observed. Our results showed that, despite optimal flowering conditions (concerning pollen fertility, stigma receptivity, and thermogenic potential), propagation of wild Alocasia macrorrhizos populations in Vanuatu was mainly vegetative. Giant taro plants might have been carried beyond the range of their most effective pollinators. Other factors were considered: the presence of numerous earwigs (Labidura truncata) insects within inflorescences, which could have a competing effect with the usual pollinators of giant taro, and the long distances between genetically homogeneous populations. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Alocasia macrorrhizos; Giant taro; Population variability; Reproduction; Self-incompatibility; Thermogenesis; Vanuatu,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49149104317

After contact with the drop, the pollen intine absorbs moisture from the drop, expands and the exine is shed. In this study the significance of the shedding of the exine is interpreted from experiments in which simulated pollination drops and micropyles were used to determine the movement of pollen and other particles in suspension. The non-expanded pollen, which can be observed upon contact with the pollination drop, sheds the exine, which then functions as a non-elastic particle, while the pollen from which the exine was shed swells and functions as an elastic particle because it is enclosed by the flexible intine. Non-elastic particles are not easily transferred through narrow passages (the micropyle and micropylar canal) and tend to plug these passages. However, elastic particles, such as the swollen pollen, are easily transferred along narrow passages even when non-elastic particles are present. The simulated experiments demonstrate that exine shedding is an important feature in getting pollen through the narrow micropyle and micropylar canal to the nucellus of the ovule. © 2007 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.",Cupressaceae; Micropylar canal; Micropyle; Pollen; Pollination drop,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37849000601

We showed that epiphytic orchids had lower fruit set levels than terrestrial species and that habit explained much of the variation in floral traits among the orchids. We compared our results with data from 76 other species occurring in the study area and hypothesize that a suite of floral and population characteristics present in tropical orchids combine in epiphytes to reduce their reproductive success. Characteristics which, in addition to their habit, are associated with low reproductive success are small population size, small inflorescences, non-sectile pollinia and self-incompatibility. Several of these characteristics were phylogenetically conserved and we predict that epiphytes might therefore generally have lower fruit set levels than recorded in terrestrial species. Nectar rewards are uncommon in tropical orchids and nectarless species have displays of larger flowers, which may represent an adaptation to increase pollinator attraction, although other rewards such as oils, waxes and pseudo pollen may replace nectar. We suggest that, like many temperate orchids, a high proportion of tropical orchids may lack floral rewards and be pollinated by deceit. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Bangladesh; Flower characteristics; Fruit set; Pollinia; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36849048204

We then grew seeds from this factorial design (2 sizes × 4 pairs × 3 pollination treatments) in the greenhouse to investigate whether population size affects offspring performance in a common environment, and how small size affects purging of the inbreeding load. Multiplicative performance across four early life-stage components (seed production, seedling emergence, seedling survival and seedling growth) of smaller populations was not significantly lower, although biomass of seedlings declined in smaller populations. Self-pollination reduced seed production, seedling emergence and seedling growth, reflecting substantial inbreeding depression (? = 0.404 ± 0.043). Population size categories did not consistently differ in levels of inbreeding depression, suggesting that purging of genetic load in smaller populations has been limited, and that all populations still harbor inbreeding load.

A unique case of paternal apomixis in plants has been recently reported in Cupressus dupreziana, an endangered Mediterranean conifer. This species produces unreduced pollen that develop into all-paternal embryos within the seed tissues. We analyzed seedlings produced by open-pollinated C. dupreziana seed trees using morphological descriptors, ploidy levels assessed through flow cytometry, and AFLP genetic diversity. In situ C. dupreziana seed trees (from Algeria) produced only diploid C. dupreziana progeny. In contrast, only one-third of the progeny produced by ex situ C. dupreziana seed trees planted in French collections were similar to C. dupreziana seedlings; the other progeny were haploid or diploid C. sempervirens seedlings. These results demonstrate that C. dupreziana ovules allow for the development of all-paternal embryos from pollen produced by another species, C. sempervirens. Thus, the in planta androgenesis is achieved through the combination of the embryogenic behavior of pollen grains and the ability of seed tree ovules to act as a surrogate mother.

Aggregation should evolve only under special circumstances, because diminishing returns associated with pollen removal and receipt instead favor monads that act largely independently. All forms of aggregation result in sibling pollen grains acting together, but they seem to evolve to ease different limitations on siring success: tetrads may evolve most commonly when pollinators visit infrequently, pollen threads may be most beneficial when ovules become available synchronously, and pollinia greatly increase the probability that a pollen grain removed by a pollinator reaches a conspecific stigma. Once pollen aggregation evolves, its implications for gametophytic competition and the relatedness of seeds within fruits probably influence further reproductive evolution, especially the frequency with which pollen from a single donor sires all seeds in a fruit. This latter effect, rather than improvements in pollination efficiency, probably accounts for the common association of pollen aggregation with lowpollen : ovule ratios. The ability of orchid pollinia to reduce diminishing returns duringpollinationmay explain both the floral diversity and the widespread occurrence of deceit pollination in this clade. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

When only one fruit per plant was allowed to grow, fruit growth could be divided into two phases: slow exponential and fast exponential. Phase change from slow to fast occurred when cumulative temperatures (CTs) after anthesis reached 38 and 54°C d for pollinated and parthenocarpic fruit, respectively. The CT was calculated as the sum of the differences between daily temperatures and 5°C. When fruit at nodes 4 and above were allowed to grow, the first growth phase was prolonged. Furthermore, parthenocarpic fruit aborted frequently when the sum of the relative growth rate (RGR) with respect to the CT (the sum of RGRs) for fruit at lower nodes exceeded 0.1 g g-1 (°C d)-1. Pollination with pollen of the monoecious cucumber '028' strongly suppressed fruit abortion; a large number of fruits could develop to a commercial size even when the sum of RGRs for fruit at lower nodes exceeded 0.1 g g-1 (°C d)-1.

We have cloned a gene, NpPDR2, belonging to the still uncharacterized cluster IV from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. NpPDR2 transcripts were found in the roots and mature flowers. In the latter, NpPDR2 expression was restricted to the style and only after pollination. A 1.5-kb genomic sequence containing the putative NpPDR2 transcription promoter was fused to the ?-glucuronidase reporter gene. The GUS expression pattern confirmed the RT-PCR results that NpPDR2 was expressed in roots and the flower style and showed that it was localized around the conductive tissues. Unlike other PDR genes, NpPDR2 expression was not induced in leaf tissues by none of the hormones typically involved in biotic and abiotic stress response. Moreover, unlike NpPDR1 known to be involved in biotic stress response, NpPDR2 expression was not induced in the style upon Botrytis cinerea infection. In N. plumbaginifolia plants in which NpPDR2 expression was prevented by RNA interference, no unusual phenotype was observed, including at the flowering stage, which suggests that NpPDR2 is not essential in the reproductive process under the tested conditions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",ABC transporter; Biotic stress; Pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR); Pollination; Style,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37449014518

Box 42787, Lafayette, LA 70504-2787, United States","Kosteletzkya virginica (Malvaceae) is an herbaceous species native to North America that was introduced into China in 1993. Flowers are viable for one day and contain five independent lobes with curving stigmas that are pollinated either by insects or by stylar movement. If pollinated, stigma lobes remain erect, but if pollination fails, stigmas curve towards the anther, eventually making contact and self-fertilizing. We measured 1) the effect of pollination on stigma lobe curvature, 2) the effect of self and outcrossed pollen on pollen tube growth, and 3) the fertility of flowers in which the number of pollinated stigmas varied. Results indicate that the most important signal to halt stigma curvature occurs when the pollen tube grows beyond the stigma lobe. This response was not influenced by the amount of pollen received. The stigma lobes (n = 121) halted curvature after receiving from 1 to 162 pollen grains. Experimental pollination from one to four stigmas did not inhibit curvature of adjacent un-pollinated lobes. Under open-pollination conditions, the flowers with five stigmas produced significantly more seeds than flowers with one to four stigmas (U = 61.00, W = 881.00, P < 0.001). These results not only provide an experimental test that curvature of individual lobes is independent, it represents the first demonstration that pollen tube growth rather than pollen quantity is the signal that halts stigma lobe curvature. The ability to independently regulate curvature in each lobe allows the plant to produce a mixture of outcrossed and selfed seeds, which can maximize fitness benefits and may represent a ""best of both worlds"" mating system. © 2007 SAAB.",Kosteletzkya virginica; Pollen tube growth; Pollination; Stigma lobe curvature,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249001400

In Mauritius, we studied the reproductive traits and pollination ecology of the rare endemic cauliflorous tree Syzygium mamillatum in a restored forest (all alien plant species removed) and an adjacent unrestored area (degraded by alien plants). Flowers of S. mamillatum were only visited by generalist bird species. Although the initial number of flower buds per tree in the restored forest tended to be higher than that of trees in the unrestored area, final fruit set and the number of seeds per fruit were lower in the restored forest. This corresponded with lower bird visitation rates in the restored area. Additionally, during budding stage, most trees were severely attacked by lepidopteran larvae, and bud loss through herbivory was higher in the restored forest. Thus, the difference in reproductive performance of S. mamillatum between the two localities was caused by contrasting herbivore attack and bird visitation behavior in restored and unrestored areas. Our findings illustrate the importance of restoration efforts in mimicking the original physical structure of habitats and interaction structure of interspecific relationships, and the difficulty of doing so given the imperfect knowledge and the reality that many native species have become locally extinct and replaced by exotic species. © 2007 The Author(s).",Bird pollination; Cauliflory; Habitat restoration; Herbivory; Invasive species; Zosterops mauritianus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149057202

If size effects on reproductive success vary depending on the environmental conditions, however, the size dependency may differ among populations. We tried to detect site-specific variation in size-dependent sex allocation of a monocarpic hermaphrodite with reference to light availability. Multiple flowers and fruits were sampled from the individuals of Cardiocrinum cordatum, a monocarpic understory herb, and pollen, ovule and seed production were measured with reference to the plant size in two populations. Furthermore, frequency and foraging behavior of pollinator visitation was observed. Ovule production per flower increased with plant size in both populations, while pollen production per flower increased with size only in the population under sparse canopy. Therefore, proportional allocation to male function decreased with plant size in the population under closed canopy, but did not change in the population under sparse canopy. Pollinators usually visited only one flower per plant, indicating the negligible geitonogamous pollination in this species. Although seed production under closed canopy was lower than that under sparse canopy, seed-set rate per flower and seed mass per fruit were independent of plant size in either of the populations. Size-dependent sex allocation in this species was site-specific, suggesting that not only resource storage before reproduction (i.e., plant size) but also resource availability of environment throughout the reproductive process (i.e., light availability) affect reproductive performance in this species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Gamete production; Light availability; Monocarpic hermaphrodite; Plant size; Pollination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36448945061

We considered potential differences between males and females and the influence of environmental temperature on those preferences.

We scored the number of Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbirds feeding on each feeder, the number of consumptions made by each individual, and the amount of sugar (g) consumed per sampling period. Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbirds clearly discriminated against pure water, favoring sugar solutions; of the latter, they preferred sucrose over glucose and fructose. The mixed-sugar solution showed intermediate preference values. Neither sex nor temperature affected sugar preferences.

This study sought to identify the main factors influencing olive fruit production in this region, by modeling pollen release as an index of flowering intensity, field floral phenology data, and meteorological data over the fruiting season in three main olive-producing provinces of Andalusia: Jaén, Córdoba, and Granada. Field floral phenological data were used to determine the anthesis phase, to ascertain which period of the pollination records should be included in the models. Forecast models indicated that annual prepeak pollen index (PI) was the variable most influencing the final olive crop. Spring and summer rainfall and both maximum and minimum temperatures in summer and autumn were the major weather-related parameters affecting final fruit production, although statistical analysis revealed differences between sites with regard to the timing and the degree of their influence. Validation results confirmed the validity and accuracy of the widely-used Hirst volumetric trap as a tool for olive crop yield forecasting in high-density olive-growing areas. The models used here provided earlier and more accurate crop estimates than those traditionally used by the Andalusian regional government, and may thus enable farmers, as well as government departments, to improve both crop yield management and olive oil marketing strategies and policies.

Determining the ecological and life-history correlates of extinction proneness in tropical plant species may help reveal the mechanisms underlying their responses to habitat disturbance, and assist in the pre-emptive identification of species at risk from extinction. We determined the predictors of extinction proneness in 1884 locally extinct (n = 454) and extant (n = 1430) terrestrial angiosperms (belonging to 43 orders, 133 families, and 689 genera) in the tropical island nation of Singapore (699.4 km2), which has lost 99.6% of its primary lowland evergreen rainforest since 1819. A wide variety of traits such as geographical distribution, pollination system, sexual system, habit, habitat, height, fruit/seed dispersal mechanism, and capacity for vegetative re-sprouting were used in the analysis. Despite controlling for phylogeny (as approximated by family level classification), we found that only a small percentage of the variation in the extinction probability could be explained by these factors. Epiphytic, monoecious, and hermaphroditic species and those restricted to inland forests have higher probabilities of extinction. Species dependent on mammal pollinators also probably have higher extinction probabilities. More comparative studies that use species traits to identify extinction-prone plant species are needed to guide the enormous, but essential task of identifying species most in need of conservation action. © 2007 The Authors.",Conservation; Extinction risk; Generalized linear mixed-effects models; Life history; Phylogenetic control; Selectivity; Species traits; Tropical biotas; Vulnerability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37149027819

In this study, 54 Greek faba bean populations were cultivated over a 3-year period. Eleven morphological and 10 agronomic traits were used to describe the variation among and within populations. Furthermore, the populations germplasm pool was compared to a germplasm pool of populations derived from the inter-crossing of 54 local populations in an open-pollinated field. Nei's genetic diversity statistics analysis was applied to the morphological traits. A nested and crossed factor design and the discriminant analysis were used for analyzing the agronomic trait variations. A nested factor design was used to compare the two gene pools. The phenotypic diversity average among populations was 0.10. Among the morphological traits, stem colour at maturity, stem pigmentation at flowering time and pod distribution contributed to population heterogeneity in most cases. The phenotypic diversity values of the populations (ranging from 0.37 to 0.65) did not differ statistically. The population × year interaction was not significant for plant height and other pertinent traits. Within populations there was significant heterogeneity for most of the agronomic traits. The agronomic traits which contributed mostly to among and within population heterogeneity were pod length, number of flowers per inflorescence, pods per node, stem thickness and flowers per inflorescence/pods per node. Inter-crosses led to populations with higher performance regarding most agronomic traits due apparently to heterotic increments. It is concluded that local population mixtures can be used to develop locally adapted populations for low-input and diverse marginal environments using all the available heterogeneity found within the populations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The female plants bear 90-100 megasporophylls, of which 50-60% may be fertile, but up to 80% of those fertile seeds may be infected by Aspergillus niger var. phoenicis. This contamination results in seed and seedling death, potentially negatively affecting recruitment of plants into the population. The pattern of infection of the cones and seeds in the field was studied over a period of eight months at the Hope Mine in the Namib-Naukluft Park. Infection of the cones was found to peak coincident with the appearance of the pollination drops, and with high temperatures, winds and significant rainfall. W. mirabilis cones were microscopically examined and spores of A. niger var. phoenicis were found embedded in the dehydrating pollination drop at the tip of the micropyle, suggesting that this was one of the routes by which the seeds were infected. The heteropteran, Probergrothius sexpunctatis, was also implicated in the infection of the seeds, since it was found to be carrying spores of A. niger var. phoenicis and was observed feeding on mature seeds and immature cones. While most post-harvest treatments have proved ineffective in eradicating A. niger var. phoenicis from the seeds, promising results are presently reported using a fungicide containing tebuconazole as the active ingredient. © 2007 SAAB.",Aspergillus niger var. phoenicis; Cones; Infection; Seeds; Welwitschia mirabilis,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249042796

(Capparaceae), which is distributed in arid deserts of northern Xinjiang, was investigated. The main results can be summarized as follows. (1) The species is andromonoecious, i.e. individuals possess both male and perfect flowers. Stamens of two floral morphs are normal and can be divided into long and short ones in each flower. The perfect flowers have well developed pistils, but male flowers have aborted pistils and only function as males. (2) There were very significant differences among the populations in daily ratio of the two floral morphs, number of long and short stamens of perfect flowers and length of filaments and anthers of short stamens in male flowers (P<0.01), but no significant differences occurred in biomass of floral organ (P>0.05). (3) Anthesis was nocturnal and lasted 15-16 h. Both male and perfect flowers opened about 18:00 at dusk. The number of two floral morphs produced on each individual was indeterminate every day during flowering, which would make the individual temporally androdioecious. However, the total number of male flowers was more than that of perfect flowers within the population every day. (4) The P/O ratios of perfect flowers in three populations were 1.57×104, 1.65×104 and 1.71×104. There was no significant difference in pollen numbers (P>0.05) within population between male and perfect flowers or between long and short stamens, and also no significant difference among the populations in pollen numbers of male and perfect flowers, and in ovule numbers and P/O ratios of perfect flowers (P>0.05). (5) Dynamic curves of pollen viability of long and short stamens in the two floral morphs were similar in three populations. Pollen longevity of both long and short stamens was about 18-20 h, and duration of stigmatic receptivity was about 16-18 h. (6) Floral visitors were hymenopterous and lepidopterous insects. There was a total of seven species of floral visitors in the three populations. The activities of them were greatly affected by the climate of the desert environment. (7) Perfect flowers were not apomictic and could produce fruits after self-pollination (autogamy and geitonogamy) and cross-pollination; thus they had a mixed mating system. These results suggest that the sexual system of andromonoecy may reflect an environment-heredity interaction in C. spinosa. The male flowers increase the number of pollen grains, the P/O ratio and enhance male fitness of individuals. They also increase the floral display and consequently effect cross pollination by attracting more pollinators that bring cross-pollen to the stigmas of perfect flowers, thus increase outcrossing rate and female fitness of individuals, which insure reproductive success of C. spinosa in the extreme desert environment.",Adaptation; Andromonoecy; Capparis spinosa; Desert environment; Mixed mating system; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149135083

To test this idea, stems and receptacles were harvested at intervals over the anthesis-post-physiological maturity phase from crops, grown under good water and nutrient availability conditions, of three open-pollinated (OP) cultivars and five hybrids released at various times between 1930 and 1995. Stem NSC and structural biomass (SB) at anthesis diminished in the hybrids as compared with the OP cultivars (and across year of cultivar release), in spite of the fact that some hybrids had a significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) stem NSC concentration at anthesis. By contrast, receptacle SB and NSC concentration at anthesis showed no sign of change with year of release. Stem NSC content fell from early grain filling or from anthesis in all cultivars while receptacle NSC content rose and then fell during grain filling in most cultivars. In five of the cultivars examined, receptacle NSC content was greater at physiological maturity than at anthesis. Crop and organ NSC content dynamics varied across cultivars, in association with variations in cultivar stem biomass at anthesis, stem NSC concentration at anthesis, and cultivar particularities in post-anthesis NSC accumulation. Cultivar differences in changes of crop NSC content between anthesis and physiological maturity (?NSCA-PM, +37.7 to -55.7 g m-2) were also found, and these changed with year of cultivar release in each of the OP and hybrid categories, tending toward a null variation of ?NSCA-PM in the most recent releases of both groups of cultivars. In each of these two groups of cultivars, ?NSCA-PM also diminished with crop growth rate during grain filling, a variable that showed a strong (r2 = 0.65) linear relationship with yield corrected for oil synthesis costs. The value of ?NSCA-PM as an additional (to crop growth rate during grain filling) explanatory variable for yield corrected for oil synthesis costs, was non-significant. We conclude that, under conditions of ample water and nutrient availability, there is no evidence that cultivar differences in NSC economy during grain filling had an important role in breeding for greater sunflower yield in Argentina over the cultivar release period 1930-1995. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The tropical pioneer shrub Melastoma malabathricum (Melastomataceae) frequently aborts not only young ovaries just after flowering, but also flower buds and developed ovaries. We tested a hypothesis that the excess production of reproductive organs and their abortion in this species is an adaptation to environmental fluctuations over shorter time scales than had previously been reported in other plants. To calculate the daily demand for carbohydrate and water by reproductive organs at the level of individual plants, we measured the respiration and transpiration of the reproductive organs at various stages and monitored their growth and abortion. To determine the daily supply of carbohydrate and water, we measured the photosynthetic productivity of leaf area, solar radiation and rainfall. The daily carbohydrate demands of the reproductive organs were significantly correlated with total photosynthetic productivity per leaf area during the previous 1, 3 and 5 days, but no correlations were found between the demands for water and accumulated rainfall or radiation. The daily abortion rates of the population were also correlated with demand for carbohydrates on the previous day per total photosynthetic productivity per leaf area. In brief, it was considered that this species produced and grew more reproductive organs when more resources were supplied and that the abortion occurred when demands for carbohydrate were large. Therefore our hypothesis was supported. We concluded that this reproductive strategy was an adaptation for pioneers characterized by continuous reproduction in aseasonal tropics. In our study, the adaptive consequence of excess production was determined by measuring natural environmental fluctuation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excess production; Photosynthetic productivity; Resource boom; Respiration; Tropical pioneer,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36849037868

Results indicated that seedlings from large seeds are more vigorous and tolerant to flea beetle damage than seedlings from medium or small seeds.

These primers were designed from the conserved regions of Prunus S-RNase genes. Each cultivar produced two amplicons, apart from two cultivars that had three amplicons. In all, 36 amplicons were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of these sequences revealed 13 novel S-alleles, the amino acid sequences of which showed 62% (S15 vs. S19) to 92% (S 22 vs. S24) identity. The sequences also demonstrated several typical structural features of Prunus S-RNase genes: three conserved regions (Cl, C2 and C3), one hypervariable region (RHV) with one intron, and another intron located at the junction between the signal peptide and the mature protein. Compared to S2 from apricot, S26 from Japanese plum had only two nucleotide substitutions in the exon region, which resulted in only one amino acid residue difference in the signal peptide. However, there were large numbers of nucleotide differences in the intron regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 novel S-alleles, and those of other species in the family Rosaceae, resulted in two distinct groups which correlated with their sub-family classification (i.e., the Maloideae and the Prunoideae).

This phenomenon, called geographical parthenogenesis, has been attributed to predispositions in certain taxa, advantages of polyploidy and/or hybrid origin, advantages of uniparental reproduction, introgression of apomixis into sexuals, niche differentiation of clones, and biotic interactions. Here we focus on the role of uniparental reproduction in colonisation, and the importance of different developmental pathways, i.e. autonomous apomixis which does not require pollination and fertilisation of endosperm nuclei for successful seed set, and pseudogamous apomixis which does. A literature survey suggests that geographical parthenogenesis occurs frequently in species with autonomous apomixis, while the correlation with pseudogamy is poorly documented. However, taxonomic patterns (e.g. predominance of Asteraceae) and also methodological bias may influence estimates of frequencies of geographical parthenogenesis. We demonstrate that a flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) is a powerful method for assessing pseudogamous vs. autonomous apomixis. We show that population genetic studies provide insights into the genetic diversity of apomicts, but do not give strong support for uniparental reproduction being the only explanation of geographical parthenogenesis. Molecular studies help elucidate the evolutionary and biogeographical history of apomictic complexes, and we conclude that multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand fully the phenomenon of geographical parthenogenesis. © 2008 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",Apomixis; Biogeography; Colonisation; Polyploidy; Self-fertilisation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010575525

Shirogane-Komugi had marked high germination ability than Norin61 during seed maturation. Although the H2O2 content had no difference in the two cultivars, sensitivity to AsA of Norin61 seeds was higher than that of Shirogane-Komugi seeds during seed maturation. The sensitivity to AsA closely correlated with germination characteristic in the two cultivars. Especially, at 28 days after pollination (DAP), sensitivity to AsA in Norin61 seeds was remarkably high.

As in other insect-plant interactions, host-plant specificity is variable among taxa. While many solitary bee species display an obvious preference for a narrow spectrum of host-plants (oligolecty), others regularly visit a diversified array of pollen hosts (polylecty). Few studies have examined the patterns of host-plant associations in bees using well-resolved phylogenies at the species level combined with accurate and quantitative data on host-plant preferences. In this study, we examined the evolution of bee-plant relationships in several genera of specialist (oligolectic) bees. We used the Melittidae as a model taxon by mapping the preferred pollen hosts onto species-level phylogenies to investigate the frequency and pattern of host-plant switching. Our results suggest that host-plant associations are maintained over time in many lineages, but that host switches to unrelated plant families are also common. We find some evidence that host-switches occur more frequently to morphologically similar, rather than closely-related, host-plants suggesting that floral morphology plays a key role in host-plant evolution in bees. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2008.",Bees; Evolution; Host-plant; Melittidae s.l.; Oligolecty; Phylogeny; Polylecty,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41949093791

While partnerships like these can be justified in general on public sector human capacity enhancements and good will generation basis, it remains important to estimate the potential welfare benefits of such partnerships. An understanding of the magnitude and distribution of benefits among different stakeholders will be useful for effective design of similar partnerships in developing countries. In this study, we ex ante estimate the magnitude and distribution of potential welfare benefits from introducing Bt eggplant in India. We conducted a farm-level survey in Maharashtra, India, to collect data on production practices by eggplant growers, and farmers' willingness to pay for Bt technology. We also collected data from field trials of Bt eggplant to assess the economic potential of the technology in terms of increasing yield and reducing pesticide expenses. Following Moschini and Lapan framework we estimated the potential welfare benefits from Bt hybrid eggplant as the sum of the change in Marshallian surplus in the commodity market and the monopoly profit of private company in the seed market. Overall, our analysis shows that producers are likely to gain from the increased yield and reduced pesticide expenses associated with the Bt technology. However, consumers gain the majority (about 60%) of the expected welfare benefits. The higher magnitude of the forgone benefits (Rs 4,247 million/US$103 million) from not commercializing Bt OPV eggplant suggest the economic significance of the public-private partnership for developing genetically engineered varieties for crops such as eggplant which are considered 'a poor man's crop' in developing countries.",Eggplant; Genetically engineered; India; Public-private partnership; Welfare benefits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-55249104535

Significant changes in starch and sugar concentrations occurred over time, with both seed collections showing similar trends in temporal changes. Although concentrations were not always similar, embryo and FG tissues generally showed similar patterns of change in starch and sugar concentrations over time. Total starch concentration was highest during early seed development and decreased as development progressed.

Trees were 12 years old and research treatments were consisted of: 1-Control treatment 2- Soil surface application of Fe in two levels 3-Application of Fe as localized placement method (Chalkood method) in two levels 4-Fe injection into the trunk of tree in four levels. The experiment was performed as a randomized complete blocks design with nine treatments and three replications in four years. Trees were pollinated according to the custom of the region and irrigated through drip system. Fruit thinning was done with extra clusters deletion regarding the ratio of eight leaves to one cluster. Production was harvested and weighted each year in October, the second half. Chemical and physical analysis of leaves and fruits were also done. Obtained raw data were analyzed statistically and means were compared with each other via Duncan,s multiple range test using MSTATC software. Results showed that in most cases, injection of 25 g FeSO4 tree-1 into the trunk caused the best results. Other injection treatments were placed in second class. Localized placement of iron fertilizer was the next treatment from the viewpoint of desirable effects. Finally, soil surface application appeared as an inapt method because it was statistically similar to control treatment, in most cases. © 2008, GORGAN UNIV AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND NATURAL RESOURCES.

These interactions are essentially of five types: 1. predation of plants by animals; 2. benevolence of plants towards certain animals to prevent or reduce predation; 3. predation by plants (carnivorous plants); 4. symbiosis and mutualism; 5. seduction and deception of animals by plants for dispersal of plant reproductive structures. All types of plants are preyed on by animals, though from as far back in evolution as algae, certain plant molecules reduce or prevent predation. In the most primitive land plants, other types of interactions beneficial for plants are encountered. More evolved land plants (angiosperms) show all facets of the five types of interaction, whereas in prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae there is only predation and in some cases countermeasures to avoid it. An evolutionary path leading from predation, the original condition, to seduction, deception and carnivory, is also postulated.

In a controlled experiment the trees were encouraged to flower out of season by pruning them back severely in January, followed by tipping the newly emerged shoots together with the removal of apical leaves on either 1 or 15 June. Both dates were highly successful because all tipped shoots produce a second bloom in July. On average, four flowers per shoot were produced in the new growth in response to defoliation treatments. The second blooming lasted no more than 2 weeks. Late-forming flowers were hand pollinated and gave rise to fruit of high quality about 50 d later dian an ordinary crop. A yield of 13 t·ha-1 was produced, with no significant differences between treatments. Postponing hand defoliation by 15 days delayed the harvest period 15 to 20 days, but no other effects on fruit set and quality were noted. Fruit harvested in December and January did not show chilling injury and reached full flavor. Number of seed per fruit, and consequently fruit size, was often increased in out-of-season cherimoyas. Late fruit suffered less preharvest drop than an ordinary crop. This work shows the possibility of producing high-quality cherimoyas during winter when the cherimoya fruit is in great demand.",Annona cherimola; Defoliation; Flowering promotion; Fruit quality; Harvest date modification; Out-of-season fruit production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249036566

Forty-four analysed populations of pinto bean were collected from Samsun province in northern Turkey. The variability of the 44 self-pollinated populations of pinto bean was evaluated on morphological, reproductive, and agronomical traits during 2003–2004. Individual data for 24 traits (14 quantitative and 10 qualitative) related to earliness and yield, and plant, pod, and seed structure were analysed using Principal Component (PC) analysis which revealed differences among the populations. The PC analysis showed that the first four PC axes explained 83.3% of the total multivariate variation. Characters with high coefficients in the first PC (earliness and yield traits), and the second PC (pod length, pod width, and pod form) were considered the most important since these axes explain nearly half of the total variation. Data were subjected to cluster analysis and several groups were identified with most of the populations. Clustered into six groups, a dendrogram was prepared to evaluate morphological differences among populations. It revealed high variation.

To further understand the mechanisms involved in grain hardness, contrasting corn cultivars for grain hardness and protein quality were evaluated. The cultivars were Cateto L 237/67 (hard endosperm and low protein value), QPM BR 451 (semi-hard endosperm and high protein value); Bolivia-2 (floury endosperm and low protein value), and Opaque-2 (floury endosperm and high protein value). Evaluations were carried out at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 days after pollination in developing corn grains and in the mature grain. In developing grains, evaluation consisted in the determination of the area, percentage of starch granules, distribution of starch granules, and protein bodies in the endosperm. In mature corn grains, the parameters evaluated were: density, percentage of total proteins, levels of lysine and tryptophan, and banding pattern of zeins. The results indicate that the higher physical resistance of corn grains from the cultivars analyzed is influenced by the high percentage of total proteins, high synthesis of 27-kDa zeins, presence of protein bodies, and perfect organization of starch granules in the endosperm, independent of their sizes. ©FUNPEC-RP.",Corn; Endosperm; Protein bodies; Starch granules; Zein,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47949100278

Histochemical tests were employed to identify the main metabolites on nectary tissue and secretion samples. • Key Results: The floral nectary consists of the inner epidermis of the hypanthium and vascularized parenchyma. Some evidence indicates that the nectar release occurs via the stomata. The high populations of mitochondria, and their juxtaposition with amyloplasts, seem to be related to energy needs for starch hydrolysis. Among the alterations observed during the secretory phase, the reduction in the plastid stromatic density and starch grain size are highlighted. When the secretory stage begins, the plastid envelope disappears and a new membrane is formed, enclosing this region and giving rise to new vacuoles. After the secretory stage, cellular structures named 'extrastomatic bodies' were observed and seem to be related to the nectar resorption. • Conclusions: Starch hydrolysis contributes to nectar formation, in addition to the photosynthates derived directly from the phloem. In these nectaries, the secretion is an energy-requiring process. During the secretion stage, some plastids show starch grain hydrolysis and membrane rupture, and it was observed that the region previously occupied by this organelle continued to be reasonably well defined, and gave rise to new vacuoles. The extrastomatic bodies appear to be related to the resorption of uncollected nectar. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

It is generally acknowledged that self-fertilization may often be favored by selection at the individual level, principally by providing reproductive assurance when conditions for vector-mediated pollination are poor and also because mating system modifiers that reduce the rate of outcrossing bias their own transmission. Inbreeding depression is accepted as the principal factor opposing the selection of selfing at the individual level, though this barrier may be transient because of purging of inbreeding load from natural populations. Here we explore the possibility that the selection of selfing may occur not only at the individual level but also at the group level. Accordingly, we model the selection of mating system modifier genes within and among populations and suggest that both levels of selection play a role in the evolution of the mating system. We find that selection among populations can maintain outcrossing through higher extinction rates of selfing groups and through reduced transition rates from outcrossing to selfing. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Its fruits ripen during the period of mid-fall to early winter and are generally dark-colored although white-colored wild forms rarely exist. In Turkey, both forms are present in addition to a white and large-fruited type, cultivated in small orchards and marketed locally. We studied two sets of myrtle accessions from Hatay, Turkey. Set 1 consisted of two wild accessions, dark- and white-colored forms, and six cultivated selections, while Set 2 contained three open-pollinated individuals from each accession of Set 1. We evaluated fruit characteristics of including fruit weight, width, length, soluble solids, pH and acidity. The accessions considerably differed in all the traits tested except for soluble solids. We also examined genotypic variation of Sets 1 and 2 using 26 RAPD primers and analyzed the data by cluster and principle components analyses. The results revealed that although some of the half-sib families (e.g., 8 a, b and c) were grouped based on their maternal parents, no overall pattern was apparent. These results suggest that myrtle pollination appeared to be not restricted to the self-pollination and the cultivated types have a narrow genetic base. © 2008 Bucharest University.",Cultivated; Form; Fruit color; Myrtus communis; Wild,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951907453

Optimization of laser capture microdissection (LCM) for AZs and other specialized cell types in Arabidopsis1 allowed recent characterization of the floral stamen AZ transcriptome responding to a developmental shedding cue.2 Analyses focused on 551 AZ transcripts (AZ551) that were regulated at the highest statistical significance (p &lt; 0.0001) over five stages of stamen development spanning pre-pollination to organ shed. Here, we seek a fuller understanding of AZ integrity control by relaxing P value restrictions on statistical significance ten-fold to generate an expanded population of 1461 stamen transcripts (AZ1461). Cell wall remodeling functions in AZ1461 are significantly over-represented relative to all transcripts represented on the whole genome GeneChip. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data corresponding to cell wall-related transcripts suggests a temporal model for AZ remodeling in Arabidopsis stamens destined to abscise. ©2008 Lindes Bioscience.",4-glucanase; Abscission zone; Cell wall; Endo-?-1; Expansin; Laser capture microdissection; Pectate lyase; Pectin methylesterase; Polygalacturonase; Stamen; Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50949110334

To determine the most useful combination of desired traits of both parental species, and to develop a breeding strategy for this population, subsequent generations were produced in various ways. Self-pollination and intercrossing among BC1F1 families produced F2, and later, F3 and F4 generations. Second, third and fourth backcrosses to white clover produced BC2, BC3 and BC4 generations. All generations were compared with the parental species in a single experiment grown in sand. Expression of the desired below-ground traits of Caucasian clover was best in the BC1 generation. By contrast, the best expression of the desired above-ground white clover traits was shown by the BC2F1 generation. However, the BC2F1was pentaploid and did not stably transmit its desirable features to subsequent generations. On the other hand, advancement in the BC1 from F1 to F4 revealed significant positive variation in most of the important traits and suggested that selection would be successful. A breeding strategy was developed based on the genetically stable BC1 generation, advancing to BC1F6 by selecting for increases in shoot dry matter (DM), stolon numbers, stolon growth, improved nodal rooting radius, larger numbers of flowers and high fertility and seed-set. © 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Caucasian clover; Interspecific hybrid; Legume breeding; Pasture; Plant breeding; Trifolium ambiguum; Trifolium repens; White clover,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49149104031

This paper provides a review of work done in Thailand, showing how local varieties meet the need of rice farming in areas not reached by improved varieties for ecological, economic and social reasons, while serving to maintain genetic diversity in the field. Far from being archaic inferior types, local rice varieties can outyield modern varieties in these difficult places. Continuing seed selection by farmers resulted in individual seed lots with uniform appearance of the grain and plants, including in those characteristics that are important in crop management such as flowering and maturity time. Such uniformity that satisfies rice growers, traders and consumers, however, hides enormous genetic diversity measurable with molecular markers as well as in useful traits. Variation is found between seed of the same varieties kept by different farmers and within individual seed lots, as well as between different varieties. Hybridization among local rice varieties and also with the common wild rice (O. rufipogon) is likely to be enhanced by traits for cross pollination, e.g. extruded stigma and pollen shedding outside the glumes. Genetic diversity of this important germplasm is maintained by farmers' seed management and selection. Regular seed turnover and exchanges add to the sorting process and genetic differentiation. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651184439

For this species, numerous cultivars with showy colorful flowers have been bred since the early 1900s through selection of natural mutants and intraspecific crosses among a limited number of early ancestral varieties. Although breeding of H. macrophylla has been successful, further improvements in flower shape, flower color, and growth habit are desirable. H. scandens ssp. chinensis is a small shrub that is native to South and Southeast Asia and valued for its evergreen foliage, winter flowering and broad adaptability in mild climates. Cross-pollination between H. scandens ssp. chinensis and H. macrophylla, and subsequent ovule culture, resulted in the production of an interspecific hybrid plant. The hybridity of this plant was confirmed by RAPD analysis. The hybrid plant had flower and leaf morphologies intermediate between the two parental species. Since the hybrid showed more vigorous growth than both parents, had evergreen foliage, and flowered in winter, it has sufficient horticultural merit for commercialization and may be suitable for greenhouse culture.

Cytological study may offer the ability to develop new hybrids by revealing cultivars with good chromosome pairing and high pollen viability, which are somewhat difficult to obtain under current breeding programs. Cross pollination, pollen viability, and chromosomal behavior during meiosis were analyzed to reveal the relation between seed fertility and capsule set in Doritaenopsis hybrids. The number of mature capsules harvested and their relative seed content were used as indices of crossing availability. The results of meiosis were evaluated according to pollen viability detected by fluorescein diacetate and quantification of sporad types by acid fuchsin staining. Chromosome number and pairing at meiosis were observed in root tips or in samples of pollen mother cells. A positive relation was found among high seed set, high frequency of viable tetrads, high degree of chromosome pairing, and low frequency of chromosomal aberrations such as inversions and translocations. On the basis of these factors, three types of hybrids could be distinguished. In type one hybrids, chromosomes paired as bivalents, pollen mother cells divided into tetrads, and capsule setting occurred after pollination of pollen acceptors. In type two hybrids, chromosomes remained mainly as univalents that developed into micromeiocytes, pollen mother cell division was disrupted, and seed recovery was low after pollination. Type three hybrids showed chromosomes paired mostly as multivalents, chromosome bridges, pollen mother cell division with massive failure, and little fertility. In Doritaenopsis orchids, high pollen viability and high fertility depends on a high frequency of normal tetrads, and low seed set in cross-pollination is predicted with micronuclei in the end products of meiosis. The occurrence of chromosomal aberrations may suggest a process of genome differentiation that could compromise breeding efforts if not taken into consideration.",Orchid breeding; Pollen viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37849006106

Overall, as many total species of bees visited the flowers of the three invasive plant species as visited the seven natives. On average, invasive species were visited by twice as many bee species as were natives. With a single exception, visitors of invasives were generalist bees, rather than specialists. Colletes petalostemonis, the only native legume specialist recorded, was an abundant forager on the flowers of both species of Melilotus, demonstrating that at least some specialist bees will move to invasive plants that are closely related to their usual hosts. Species abundant on the flowers of invasives tended to collect both pollen and nectar, suggesting that bees are using pollen of Tamarix and Melilotus to provision their offspring. We argue that invasives with entomophilous flowers are unlikely to either facilitate the reproduction of uncommon native plants or consistently compete with them for pollinators.

Yet critics argue that even existing PAs deprive countries of needed agricultural lands and, given increased global agricultural demand, such expansion is unacceptable. This paper explores these issues at successive scales - from global to local. First, we examine potential conflicts between agriculture and PA expansion in forested regions using global-scale data. Second, we investigate the value of ecosystem services that support agriculture (e.g. erosion control, soil formation, pollination, biological control, and production of non-timber forest products) to regions identified as global priorities for biodiversity conservation, and spatially quantify the value of ecosystem services to agriculture. Third, we move to regional and national scales, examining how loss of forest services can reduce agricultural production, potentially compromising livelihoods. Finally, we examine ways to integrate agriculture and biodiversity conservation for sustainable landscapes and livelihoods. Across all scales, research demonstrates that in most places, it is both possible and desirable to expand the area for biodiversity conservation, thereby protecting ecosystem services that are vital to sustainable agricultural production and local livelihoods. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73849147173

The focus was on three endangered, ecologically and economically important species: Cedrela fissilis, Cedrela odorata and Toona ciliata. The aims of the study were to characterize the patterns of floral development in the tribe and to establish apomorphic and plesiomorphic floral characters in relation to other taxa within the family based on the current molecular phylogeny of Meliaceae. • Methods: A detailed floral structural and developmental study was completed using both scanning electron microscopy and visualization of microtome sections with a light microscope. • Key Results: Twelve floral developmental stages were identified. The initial development of the pentamerous flowers of both Toona and Cedrela is strikingly similar. The morphological differences observed between them are due to differential patterns of organ elongation and adnation/connation occurring late in development. Additionally, the formation of functionally male and female flowers was found to occur at specific positions within the inflorescence. • Conclusions: Due to the basal position of the tribe Cedreleae in the phylogeny of Meliaceae, functionally either male or female pentamerous flowers and the presence of (at least partially) free stamens may be considered plesiomorphic traits within the family.

Impacting on all is the increasing number of species and strains of animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms that must be managed. Planning and implementing appropriate farm- and country-level actions requires accurate identification of organisms to access information although, in developing countries, many important species are neither named scientifically nor their local taxonomies and uses well documented. Improvement and adaptation of crops and livestock to changing environment and needs has long depended on genes from wild relatives. Implementing adequate biosecurity for agriculture at national and local levels may involve information on biota globally. Agricultural and neighbouring ecosystems provide poorly-characterised reservoirs for pests, natural enemies, pollinators and other organisms detrimental, beneficial or essential to productive and resilient agro-ecosystems, and the latter must be assessed and monitored for agricultural impacts under the ecosystem approach. To support these actions taxonomy must deliver timely and appropriate information to those who can use it most effectively. This is hindered by poor funding, lack of clarity on resources required and responsibility for action, and poor delivery systems. The needs of agriculture are inadequately met. Policies developed globally to address this issue are not always simple to implement, or to integrate with other agricultural and scientific policies. Solutions lie in greater integration of activities and better information flow between taxonomy, agriculture, research and policy, and provision of appropriate infrastructure and human capacity. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72849138562

The laggard-free PMCs also appeared at a lower ratio, which indicated that the B genome chromosome could be transmitted into gametes. The chromosome configurations of 20II and 19II+2 I that appeared in double MALs (AACC + 2 chromosomes of the B genome) indicated different homoeology between different B genome chromosomes.

We filmed the abscission of seeds of five wind-dispersed tropical species near the coast of Mexico (Jalisco). We found that (1) most abscission occurred during the period from 10:00 to 17:00 hours; (2) there was a strong bias for landward dispersal due to the midday sea breeze; (3) the little nocturnal dispersal that occurred was toward the sea (due to the night land breeze); (4) there was no abscission in the absence of wind (i.e., indoors) except for one species; and (5) holding relative humidity constant, the proportion of seeds diurnally abscising is strongly correlated with horizontal wind speed. We predict that a similar bias (this time for upslope dispersal) for xerochastic dispersal will occur in complex terrain.

The polymorphism promotes intermorph pollen transfer, thus outcrossing. Heterostyly has been reported in 28 angiosperm families and is frequently lost in heterostylous lineages. To assess ecological factors related to shifts from heterostyly to monomorphy, we examined the reproductive ecology of heterostylous tropical shrubs of Psychotria. Among 21 species at Barro Colorado Island and the nearby Parque Nacional Soberania, Panama, 14 species were heterostylous while seven were monomorphic. A molecular phylogeny and the existence elsewhere of heterostylous populations indicated that the breakdown of heterostyly had occurred independently. Heterostylous and monomorphic species were visited by the same bee species, although visit frequencies were lower in monomorphic species. Monomorphic species had significantly lower population density and greater fruit set than did heterostylous species. Autonomous autogamy made a large contribution to fruit set in monomorphic species and was only rarely observed in heterostylous species. The results indicate monomorphic and heterostylous species produce more seeds through selfing and outcrossing, respectively. The limitation of outcrossing as a result of low population density may be related to the breakdown of heterostyly and the evolution of selfing. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.",Barro Colorado Island; Breeding system evolution; Panama; Pollination; Rarity; Self-fertilization; Tropical forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249015353

Maize pollen concentrations were modeled by a modified Lagrangian stochastic (LS) model of the convective boundary layer (CBL) and were compared with concentrations measured by airborne remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) flown from directly above to 2 km from source fields. The turbulence parameterization in an existing CBL LS model was modified to incorporate the effects of shear-driven turbulence, which has an especially large impact near the surface, where maize pollen is released. The modified model was used to calculate concentrations corresponding to the RPV flight tracks. For the most convective cases, when at least 95% of the pollen came from sources near the RPV flight track for which source strength measurements are available and the results are less sensitive to uncertainty in wind direction since most of the pollen came from directly beneath the flight track, the geometric mean of the ratio between the modeled and measured concentrations was 0.94. When cases with larger contributions from more distant fields were included, the overall geometric mean decreased to 0.43. The scatter of the measured concentrations about the modeled values followed a lognormal distribution.

The use of uniform, high-yielding cultivars and breeds has reduced the number of species used in agriculture (crops and animals), contributing to the instability of the entire world food system. Organic agriculture, on the other hand, through its ecological approach, promotes biodiversity and maintains the integrity of the ecosystem. Research into organic agricultural practices has shown that organic systems can support biodiversity conservation through increasing the number and variety of wild species found on farms and supporting high levels of agrobiodiversity (landscape, species and varieties). This paper discusses the contribution of organic agriculture to agrobiodiversity. Its positive impact on wildlife (e.g. pollinators, birds, soil fauna and flora, predatory invertebrates) is not included in this analysis. The cited examples demonstrate how organic agriculture is reversing the decline in species diversity as well as abundance of each species.

Objective: We determined the release of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 from pollen of birch trees growing in 2 different geographic regions in Germany for 2 consecutive years. Methods: Catkins were collected during pollination in 2002 and 2003 from 82 healthy trees in South (Munich) and West Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia). The release of Bet v 1 from pollen samples was determined by a Bet v 1-specific ELISA. Results: Pollen from South Germany released about 3 times more Bet v 1 than those from West Germany in both 2002 and 2003 (p = 0.034 and p = 0.007, respectively). This was independent of the number of pollen during the pollen flight season. In 2003, the release of Bet v 1 from pollen was more than 5 times higher than in 2002 in both regions (South Germany 6.1 times, p < 0.001; West Germany 5.4 times, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Despite large individual differences, there seem to be regional and year-to-year variations in Bet v 1 release from birch pollen. Therefore, the combination of pollen count and release of Bet v 1 from this pollen must be assessed to estimate Bet v 1 exposure reliably. Copyright © 2007 S.

Very intensive plus-tree selection began in the early 1950s, the first seed orchard planting was in 1958, and the first orchard seed was collected in 1968. By 1985 seed orchards could meet the national planting needs, which helped prompt an innovative seed certification scheme. Selection began in local, ‘land-race’ stands. That proved appropriate, but better knowledge led to research on material from the species’ entire natural range and then to further seed importations from natural stands, mainly for future genetic resources. Initial plus-tree selection largely addressed poor tree form in the central North Island. This led to selecting a ‘short-internode’ (‘multinodal’) branching ideotype, with great improvements in general tree form and substantial gains in growth rate. A distinctive portfolio of several breeds, representing different breeding goals, has since been developed for the diverse planting sites and the various end products. By contrast, the original regionalisation of seed orchards proved largely unjustified. Despite early research indicating good heritabilities, wood properties have figured significantly in breeding goals only since growers substantially reduced harvest ages, but they are now intensively researched. The breeding program was greatly expanded from 1968 to meet the needs of multi-generation breeding. This was one of the program's contributions to developing breeding strategy as a discipline, various of which were reflected in the 1986 Development Plan. Industry uptake of tree breeding has since posed challenges in maintaining genetic variability for a secure, long-term underpinning of the program. Special genetic-gain trials were first planted in 1978, to demonstrate and quantify genetic improvement, and to help update forest out-turn predictions. The gains achieved in tree form helped induce New South Wales State to affiliate with the New Zealand program, following significant earlier contributions of breeding material to Australian breeding programs. Improved technologies for seed orchards and vegetative propagation have facilitated development of the breed portfolio and more specific customisation of seedlots. Becoming able to deliver genetic gain through controlled pollination has allowed changes in the structure of the breeding population. Further changes are resulting from an increasing capability to reconstruct pedigrees after open pollination. Developments towards full clonal forestry have faced obstacles, but offer greater genetic gains and a more precise customisation, and clonal forestry is now being vigorously commercialised. Having a single, large Forest Service until 1987 undoubtedly favoured the development of a very strong tree improvement program. Since then, continuing institutional changes, which are reviewed, have posed numerous challenges. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Breeding programs; Genetic improvement; History; New Zealand; Pinus radiata; Planning; Seed orchards; Traits; Tree breeding; Vegetative propagation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58249114224

The genetic material used was 'Poinsett 76', an old American cultivar used for fresh consumption. The two experiments differed not only in season and location, but also in cultural practices. In the Winter, the plants were trailed and hand-pollinated, whereas in the Summer the plants lay on the beds and were naturally bee-pollinated. The number of fruit per plant did not significantly affect individual fruit weight or seed yield components in either experiment. In contrast, fruit-set order position affected the seed yield components in the field, but not in the greenhouse. In the field experiment, both seed number per fruit and mean seed weight decreased with increasing fruit-set order position. The number of seeds per fruit in 'Poinsett 76' cucumber, a cultivar with a strong tendency to parthenocarpic fruit-set, varied, and was affected by cultural conditions. The number of fully-developed seeds per fruit was often low, far below its full potential. In the present study, this was expressed in high mean percentages of empty seeds: 58% and 55% in Winter and Summer, respectively. Neither the number of fruit per plant, nor the fruit-set order position affected the germination percentages at fruit harvest, or after up-to-7 years in storage. In all germination tests, Summer- and Winter-produced seeds achieved germination percentages of 80-95% and > 95%, respectively. On the other hand, the speed of germination was decreased by storage, and was slower in seeds extracted from immature fruit than in those from fully mature fruit.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47749107608

Assisted pollination experiments were carried out to examine the breeding system of L. subcordatum. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) were employed to check the pollen germination and the growth of pollen tubes. Results were obtained as follows: (1) The flowering period of L. subcordatum was from September to the next February with a peak at September-October; the longevity of a single flower was 4-6 days. (2) L. subcordatum was protogynous, and pollen grains could be found on self-stigmata when the anthers opened 12-24 h after petals unrolling. (3)The pollen viability (MTT test) maintained for ca. 26 hours; the pollen was starchless; the P/O was 8420±720.86 (n=10); no nectar secretion was observed. (4) Thrips (Thrips sp.) were the only floral visitors observed but which seldom moved among inflorescences, thus played limited role in pollination. (5) Fruit sets of untreated bagged (5.30±1.83%) and hand assisted cross pollinated flowers (6.67±1.91%) were not significantly different from that of open flowers (4.79±1.45%). (6) SEM and FM observations proved that pollen germinated on self-stigmata and pollen tubes growed in self-styles. The results indicated that L. subcordatum was facultatively autogamous and without apomixes. The possibility of outcrossing and the protogyny might indicate that the species was originally a crosser. Flowers pollinated in September-October usually start ovule growth in next summer, and set mature fruits in next October (after the next flowering peak), suggesting the occurrence of retard embryo development.

Spring events such as leafing and flowering have typically advanced, some by several weeks, with median advances of 4-5 d per degree Celsius. Autumn events, such as leaf coloring or leaf fall, have usually become delayed, though with more variability than spring events. Changes in summer events have been mixed. Phenological changes have varied geographically, as have recent temperature changes. Most studies of at least several decades duration show the initiation of rapid changes in the 1970s or 1980s, paralleling patterns of temperature change. Plants and animals in a given area have often responded at different rates to temperature change, which is likely to change patterns of interaction between plants and their pollinators and herbivores. Altitudinal changes in plant distributions have been demonstrated in several areas, especially in Scandinavia and in Mediterranean Europe, though these changes lag the measured temperature changes. Latitudinal changes in plant distribution have been demonstrated in only a few instances and it has been suggested that precipitation changes may have limited range shifts in response to warming in some areas. The observed and predicted changes in plant distribution and phenology have major implications for various ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including ecosystem productivity, species interactions, community structure, and conservation of biodiversity.",Climate change; Distribution limits; Flowering; Global warming; Leafing; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949108247

By investigating biological characteristics and reproductive behavior of Cypripedium lentiginosum, an orchid endemic to Yunnan of China, the number of survivals in each age-class, the frequency and number of filial generations, and the reproductive behavior and mechanism were explored. The internal distribution pattern was figured out based on genet frequency. On the basis of the number of survivals in each age-class and the number of filial generations, the static life table and fecundity table of the populations were made, the survival curve and age pyramid were drawn, and the Leslie matrix model and the density-dependent growth model Nt=658e0.211t were structured to predict numerical dynamics. Reproductive behavior and breeding strategy were analyzed by observing phenological characteristics and pollination biology. Based on these, we analyzed the relationship between the numerical dynamics and the reproductive behavior, as well as its internal distribution pattern and age pyramid. We found that C. lentiginosum showed a clumped dispersion distribution pattern, its age pyramid was pyramid-bell shaped, and its population survival exhibited a Deevey I shape. The net reproductive rate and the intrinsic and finite rates of increase for C. lentiginosum were comparatively high, indicating that the population was expanding. The population growth is affected by self-density, and the prediction model based on this factor is Nt=6000/(1+e2.094-0.211t), which is suitable for predicting the numerical dynamics of C. lentiginosum. The species are endowed with both asexual and sexual reproductions. The former, i.e., asexual reproduction, does not increase individual quantity, but sustains the current genetics of the populations and accumulates energy for sexual reproduction, while the latter, i.e., sexual reproduction, involves pollinating flowers by mimicking brood-sites to lure the hoverfly into the labellum, whose fruit set rate is 54.37%±6.08%. The fruits grow into sufficient young plants and most of them could live through the sexual reproduction stage. Sexual reproduction generates progeny many times over a long period, suggesting that this kind of reproductive mode is the main factor affecting the numerical dynamics of a population. The species' successful reproductive strategies and their impacts on the numerical dynamics in spatial and age distributions indicate that the population development of C. lentiginosum corresponds to its biological characteristics. Discontinuity and narrowness of growing space in the habitat are the main factors restricting population development. However, at present, the species does not need or will not prosper from ex-situ conservation. © 2008 Ecological Society of China.",Cypripedium lentiginosum; endangering mechanism; Leslie matrix model; population dynamics; reproductive behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40649124775

Patterns of pollen flow can be used to assess the risk of genetic pollution of native forest areas from nearby plantations. Pollen flow in an artificial population of Eucalyptus grandis was estimated using molecular markers and paternity analysis. Microsatellite genotyping was used to identify pollen parents of progeny arrays from six mother trees. Of 329 progeny analysed, 178 (54%) were assigned to pollen parents within the population. Pollen parents located within the population were between 0-192 m from the respective mother trees, with an average pollination distance of 57.96 m. Pollination of mother trees was outcrossed, not by nearest neighbours, and displayed a preference for inter-provenance matings within the population. Progeny that could not be assigned pollen parents within the population (46%) were assumed to have resulted from pollen immigration from external sources. These pollen flow parameters provide useful information about the dynamics of pollen movement within E. grandis populations and may be used in risk assessment of gene flow from plantations to adjacent areas of native forest. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Forest tree; Gene flow; Most-likely parent; Myrtaceae; Paternity assignment; Pollen contamination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36448949807

We found three clones, an unknown protein (Tc61), a pectin methylesterase-like protein (Tc62) and a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat)-like protein (Tc72). The Tc61 protein interacted strongly with the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer, and its transcript was expressed in stems and leaves of 3-year-old Taiwania seedlings and in microsporangiate and ovulate cones. The pectin methylesterase-like protein was expressed abundantly in the roots of 3-year-old Taiwania seedlings and in pollinated ovulate cones, indicating that binding with the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer may be involved in root development and growth of pollen tubes during pollination. The Tc72 protein encoded a complete TPR-like protein that is highly conserved among plants, with 10 ?-helices and three conserved TPR motifs containing five consensus residues necessary for stable inter-helix packing. A tissue expression assay and light/dark treatments showed that the Tc72 gene was expressed abundantly in the leaves of seedlings and was sensitive to light and dark, as are the Tcmago and TcY14 genes, implying that the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer interaction with Tc72 may be related to chloroplast protein transport. © 2008 Heron Publishing.",Molecular identification; Protein structure; Tissue-specific expression patterns; Yeast two-hybrid screen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51149083904

The resistance breeding program initiated in 1978 in southeastern region identified 16 clones of black pines and 98 clones of red pines as tolerant as loblolly pine. A similar grogram was also started in northeastern region since 1992. More than 10 ha of seed orchards were established for both species with the selected pines and they are now in operational seed production. The progeny showed much higher in survival as compared to the unselected ones at the nursery inoculation tests; 35% higher for black pine and 18% for red pine. These progeny are further screened by the inoculation before out-planting and it will bring about additional 20% increase in survival for black pine within the range 25 to 60% of average survival rate. A mass production system for rooted cutting from pre-screened seedling was developed and it is expected to reduce the production cost by 40%. The progeny of the selected pines showed better in tolerance to the natural infection unless they were exposed to the excessive environmental stress without any other protection measures. Seed orchard improvement based on progeny tolerance has become a realistic option for red pine and it will bring about additional 10% increase in nursery survival. Since the results of inoculation tests with control pollinated progeny indicated that the tolerance was inherited additively, large scale control pollination and simple mass selection using open pollinated progeny are conducted concomitantly to obtain more tolerant pines together with a research to develop MAS. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Pine wilt disease,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024210024

(2n = 2x = 22; 2n = 2x = 22 and 20), collected in the pampas grasslands of Argentina, and the edible carrot, Daucus carota L. (2n = 2x = 18), controlled pollinations were attempted on the plant. Due to the difficulties encountered, flowers of 12 accesions and three commercial cultivars were excised from individual plants and pollinated in Petri dishes following an incomplete diallel design. After processing, the pollinated pistils (four to six per genotypic combination) were observed under a microscope with UV light. Pollen tubes reaching the ovaries and/or the ovules (compatible relation) were observed in six out of nine D. pusillus × D. pusillus and seven out of 18 D. pusillus × D. carota genotypic combinations. In the eight D. carota × D. pusillus genotypic combinations, only ungerminated pollen, pollen not adhered to the stigmas or pollen tubes overlapping the stylar tissue were observed. Additional flowers were pollinated in a sample of compatible genotypic combinations and the pollinated pistils were in vitro culture to study embryo and endosperm development. Eight out of nine pistils from the intraspecific and nine out of 13 from the interspecific crosses enlarged to form apparently normal schizocarps. Histological analyses revealed normal development of embryo and endosperm. The breeding barriers between the two species are incomplete, making feasible the obtainment of interspecific hybrids by conventional techniques. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",D. pusillus Michx.; Daucus carota L.; Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic breeding barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36749086574

Proteins on the surfaces of the sperm, egg, central, and synergid cells might be important for guidance and recognition/fusion of the gametes. Here, we present functional analyses of Arabidopsis GEX3, which encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that has homologs in other plants. GEX3 is expressed in both the vegetative and sperm cells of the male gametophyte and in the egg cell of the female gametophyte. Transgenic lines in which GEX3 was down-regulated or overexpressed, using the Arabidopsis GEX2 promoter, had reduced seed set. Reciprocal crosses and imaging after pollination with a reporter line showed that, in both cases, the defect causing reduced seed set occurred in the female. In the antisense lines, micropylar pollen tube guidance failed. In the overexpression lines, fertilization of mutant ovules was mostly blocked because pollen tube guidance failed, although, occasionally, non-viable embryos were formed. We conclude that properly regulated expression of GEX3 in the egg cell of Arabidopsis is essential for pollen tube guidance. © The Author 2008.",Antisense; Double fertilization; Female gametophyte; Plasma membrane protein; PQQ domain; Real-time PCR,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-57749096624

The development of open spaces through crop cultivation and animal husbandry has led to the wide diversity of landscape that exists in Europe… Over centuries people have bred livestock and cultivated plants especially suited to their local environment. Biologically valuable traditional agro-ecosystems developed within each regional ecosystem with the sustainable use of the natural surroundings. Agrobiodiversity is an essential, integral part of biological diversity, as it is reflected in the “Convention on Biological Diversity”. Not only are wild animals and plants worthy of protection and conservation, their domesticated relatives are equally worthy. Yield increases, industrialisation and over-use in agricultural production have also led to destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity, not only in the case of wildlife but also domesticated breeds and varieties. Relicts of once extensive regional ecosystems need to be conserved long-term in both sustainable and economically viable ways. There are many fruitful synergies to be found between nature conservation and agrobiodiversity. The regional ecosystems worthy of protection can only be preserved in their full diversity with management. Old livestock breeds and cultivated plants, adapted to the locality, offer a low-cost alternative to elaborate technical solutions. Traditional agro-eco-systems, in which specifically adapted livestock and cultivated plants are used, conserve the functioning of ecological systems promoting soil fertility, regulation of pests and diseases and increase pollination. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73949091120
