The flowers produce large quantities of nectar but they are rarely visited by hummingbirds. Inflorescence and floral morphology, and low levels of sucrose in the nectar probably explain the rarity of foraging hummingbirds. A comparison of Old World Erythrina and their pollinators with New World species pollinated by orioles and hummingbirds suggests that parallel evolution has occurred. When the comparison is expanded to include other species pollinated by orioles, it is clear that various New World Icteridae, Thraupidae, etc. are ecological equivalents of Old World Oriolidae, Pycnonotidae, Sturnidae, etc. and that flowers pollinated by these birds have similar characteristics. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",Campylorhynchus; Erythrina breviflora; Fabaceae (Leguminosae); Icterus; nectar; ornithophily; Piranga; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000922694

When collecting nectar, the bats visit various species of plants4-6, and in periods of peak abundance of flowers they make increasingly frequent visits. With flowering apparently synchronised 3,4, there seems to be a good chance that flowers may not always receive conspecific pollen, thus reducing their seed set and fitness. The study reported here suggests that this chance is minimised because nectar and pollen are available at different times on different flower species, and because some species deposit and receive pollen at distinct regions of the bats' bodies. © 1977 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012169217

The presence of a strong incompatibility system is indicated by the fact that intramorph crosses or self-pollinations produced little or no seed and intermorph crosses produced copious seed. An unusual homostyle was located that had most floral characters intermediate between pin and thrum flowers, although its pollen size was that of pin. The homostyle was only moderately self-compatible, and its pollen did not behave as pin pollen on thrum stigmas. It appears that, despite their intermediate position and morphology, the homostyle stigmas were fundamentally pin. Although the exceptional rarity of the homostyle suggests that it is an inadaptive failure, workers should watch for its further occurrence since additional study of it may provide insights into the genetic and physiological basis of heterostyly in the Rubiaceae. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",breeding system; Hedyotis; Heterostyly; homostyly; incompatibility; Rubiaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344059861

One flower species which has a small amount of pollen and which is visited by a pollinator species with extreme flower constancy is singled out. The advantage of the attraction to other pollinator species without flower constancy is investigated. In particular, the number of pollinated flowers is calculated as a function of the degree of attraction.

Parthenocarpic fruits were larger and had higher fresh weight and percentage water than pollinated fruits at day 1 but the positions were reversed by day 9. Unpollinated fruits did not increase in size after day 3.Pericarp cells were small, of regular shape and showed no obvious change with either time or treatment. Cell number increased in the pollinated and parthenocarpic but not in the unpollinated fruits.Cells divided in the flesh of the parthenocarpic but not of the pollinated fruits which increased in size by cell enlargement only. Starch, present in the cells of the flesh and placenta at day 0 was absent from the unpollinated fruits at day 6.Ovules grew in both pollinated and parthenocarpic fruits largely due to cell division in the nucellus and integuments; the pollinated ovules were larger than the parthenocarpic throughout. Embryo and endosperm development occurred in the pollinated but not in the parthenocarpic ovules. Starch was present throughout the nine-day period in the integuments of the pollinated and parthenocarpic ovules but was lost from the integuments of the unpollinated ovules by day 6. Pollinated and parthenocarpic ovules contributed increasingly to fruit dry weight over the nine-day period.It is suggested that the ovule tissues, in particular the nucellus and integument may exert control over early development in both pollinated and parthenocarpic fruits. © 1977 Annals of Botany Company.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000729592

Knox and associates have proposed that in the sporophytic system of incompatibility the compatible mentor pollen provides the so-called 'specific recognition substances' to the incompatible pollen thereby making the latter compatible. In the present experiments mentor pollen was used in attempts to overcome both intra- and interspecific incompatibility in the genus Nicotiana which has a gametophytic intraspecific incompatibility system. Although not denying that recognition substances specific to pollenpistil incompatibility reactions are present in pollen walls, the results suggest that a role of mentor pollen in overcoming incompatibility may be to provide extra free pollen growth promoting substances (PGS). These substances are apparently able to promote just sufficient further growth to allow some fertilizations by certain pollen tubes with inherently weak expression of incompatibility. The present proposed 'PGS-Hypothesis' also elucidates the physiological basis of the widely-held relationship found between genetic systems of self-incompatibility and sites of pollen inhibition. © 1977 Dr. W.

After 200 kR treatment (highest dose) a high percentage of pollen became non-viable, and tube growth of all the germinated pollen was inhibited at the first third, or just before half the length of the style. Observations on the ultrastructural aspects revealed that the pollen tubes were destroyed by a precise degradation process which led to the disappearance of the inner wall, lysis of the tube, accumulation of several bipartite particles and alteration of endoplasmic reticulum into a whorl of concentric circles. These results indicated that the high dose of gamma rays probably interferes with protein synthesis. The ultrastructural aspects of compatible pollen tubes after gamma irradiation were similar to those of self-incompatible tubes and therefore it is suggested that cessation of protein synthesis might also be a result of incompatibility. Electron microscopy observations after treatment with 200 kR gamma rays on flowers after self-incompatible pollination (S1S4 × S1S4) showed that gamma irradiation affects the self-incompatibility reaction; but the results obtained so far are difficult to explain. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346268191

In general, the number of normal kernels decreased and the number and percentage of shrunken kernels increased with increasing exposure. However, significant exposure X hybrid interactions were present indicating that the amount of change depended on the hybrid. No consistent relationship between exposure and either normal or shrunken kernel weight was apparent, but pollen source hybrid was a contributing factor. The embryo weight and coleoptile length after germination were also determined for the normal kernels. Changes in these characters by irradiation were also strongly influenced by the hybrid.

Pollen exudates contain various acid hydrolases, but are incapable alone of eroding stigma cutin. Furthermore, there is no penetration when the proteins of the wall-held stigma secretions are degraded enzymically.

Combining this new evidence with that from prior genetic, biochemical, and ultrastructural studies, a working model is hypothesized for the molecular events which occur during self recognition and the subsequent control of pollen germination. Self recognition is postulated to involve the interaction of a presynthesized, genotype-specific recognition molecule (effector) produced by the stigma with a presynthesized receptor molecule produced by and located in or on the pollen grain. The consequence of self recognition is a selective inhibition of pollen protein synthesis within about 2-4 minutes after imbibition. We deduced that protein synthesis is programmed to occur in pollen - unless interrupted as a consequence of self-recognition - and leads to the sequential production of opposing regulators: first a germination inhibitor (G-Inh), then a germination activator (G-Act). These regulators in turn control the activities of presynthesized, and probably sequestered enzymes required for germ tube formation. Sequential appearances of the G-Inh and G-Act occur unless synthesis of the G-Act is blocked as a result of self recognition. Thus, following a self pollination, recognition occurs in sufficient time to block production of the G-Act but not of the G-Inh, and inhibition of germination (incompatibility) results. For a cross pollination, there is no self recognition and production of the G-Act is unimpeded; it then nullifies the effect of the G-Inh and pollen germination (compatibility) results.

In the open pollinated progeny of this triploid, one plant with chromosome numerical mosaicism, chromosome number varying from 2 n=28 to 37 of which 23 to 33 normal chromosomes and 3 to 7 telocentrics, was obtained. In PMC meiosis higher associations of 5, 6, 7 or 8 normal chromosomes were observed. This plant was highly sterile. Of the five progeny plants that could be obtained on selfing and open pollination 4 plants showed chromosome numerical mosaicism and one plant had a constant chromosome number of 2 n=26+4 telos. As this phenomenon of intraplant chromosome numerical variation can be transmitted from generation to generation it was considered to be genotypically controlled. It was further argued that gene combinations are responsible for the instability and not always associated with higher gene dosage and hence higher polyploidy as suggested by Gildenhuys and Brix in induced amphiploids of Pennisetum. The same factor that was responsible for the chromosome numerical mosaicism seemed to be responsible for the origin of the tetraploid from the triploid. © 1973 Indian Academy of Sciences.",numerical mosaicism; Pearl millet chromosome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542589230

The specificities of these three reactions were also studied. These three reactions are all effective for light microscopic demonstration of polysaccharides in the filiform apparatus, starch grains in the cells and PAS substance in the micropylar region. Nonspecific staining of the nucleoli of the egg and polar nuclei was observed in the PAS reaction. The PA-TSC-AgPr reaction is very specific for polysaccharides but its overall reaction takes a much longer period of time than the PAS reaction. The PA-TSC-OsO4 reaction colors the cytoplasm and nuclei of most cells and therefore stains of the cell walls, especially those of the egg cell and synergids, do not stand out clearly. The synergid cytoplasm contains some amorphous polysaccharides and thus it colors even in PAS and PA-TSC-AgPr preparations. In the mature embryo sac, the egg and central cell as well as antipodals are vacuolated but the two synergids have no visible vacuoles under light microscope. Each synergid has a prominent filiform apparatus at the micropylar end, which stains intensely in all three preparations. The walls of the central cell and antipodals adjacent to the nucellar cells have many inward papillae which are also intensely stained in all three preparations. Starch grains are abundant in the ovary wall and usually absent in the nucellus and integuments. They are present in the egg, central cell and antipodals, but not in the two synergids. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017665495

In a preliminary study, four chemicals were applied to three cultivars of spring wheat at two application times. RH-532 was the most effective of the four gametocides, reducing fertility to a 0 10% level for all three cultivars. In a second experiment, RH-532 was applied to one cytoplasmic male-sterile and three normal spring wheats at four rates (0.56, 1.12, 2.24, and 4.48 kg/ha) and at two times of application. Alternate strips of pollinator were planted throughout the experiment. All treatments decreased fertility. plant height, and spike length of the three normal wheats. RH-532 did not inhibit spike emergence of two semidwarf cultivars or one of conventional height. Cultivars did not respond similarly to treatments. Yields of cross-pollinated seed were only 1 21% of the normal yield when fertility levels on treated plants reached 0 10%. Hybrid seed content of the harvested seed ranged from 2 55%. On the treated male-sterile line, yield was significantly reduced in comparison with the open-pollinated check. Inhibitory properties of this chemical suppressed the fertilization potential of the female as well as inducing male sterility. The differential response of genotypes to treatments indicates that cultivars should be screened for male and female sensitivity to this chemical. If differential sensitivity is found, breeding and selection to improve this trait may be possible. Different environmental conditions may alter the response of cultivars to this chemical, with less effect on the female structures. © 1977 H.

The rate of ethylene production of cut, unpollinated flowers aged in water at 18°C was low until the onset of petal wilting, when a rapid surge of ethylene occurred in all tissues. The flower ethylene production was evolved mostly from the styles and petals. The bases of petals from unpollinated, senescing flowers evolved ethylene faster and sometimes earlier than the upper parts. Treatment of cut flowers with propylene, an ethylene analogue, accelerated wilting of flower petals and promoted endogenous ethylene production in all flower tissues. Pollination of intact flowers also promoted endogenous ethylene production and caused accelerated petal wilting within 2-3 days from pollination. Although the data are consistent with the hypothesis that ethylene forms a link between pollination of the style and petal wilting, in the unpollinated flower the style and petals can evolve a surge of ethylene independently of each other, about the time when the petals irreversibly wilt. The results are discussed in relation to the role of ethylene in flower senescence. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",Dianthus; Ethylene; Flower; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001414876

Floral structure or the arrangement of inflorescences ensures that birds probing flowers will regularly brush the anthers and stigmas. The pollen is carried on the bill or feathers and is well suited to its mode of transport. No specific relation between birds and flowers was found. Each species of bird visited many flowers and each species of plant was visited by many species of birds. The plants appear adapted to the Meliphagidae as a whole. However, insects also visited many plants. The importance of birds compared to insects as pollinators is discussed. © 1977 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971074145

The process is now shown to entail: (a) loading of pollen in the polleniferous fig into intersegmental and pleural invaginations which form in the shrunken body of the wasp following water loss; (b) unloading of pollen in the receptive fig, as a result of partial swelling and contortion of the wasp's body during oviposition attempts.

Wilting rate was fastest following cross-pollination and slowest in unpollinated flowers. The difference between wilting behaviour of cross- and self-pollinated flowers was not caused by rate of pollen tube growth and not by the incompatibility (recognition or rejection) reaction either. It is assumed, that, following pollination, the wilting reaction is only retarded after penetration of pollen tubes of the same genetic composition as the style (complete self-pollination). The number of viable pollen grains necessary to initiate a maximal wilting-rate of flowers following cross- and self-pollination is about 800, which means that a fifth of the stigmatic surface must be covered with living pollen grains. It is suggested that pollen tube penetration and injury of the style have a similar influence on the initiation of wilting. Wilting-rate following pollination is faster in young plants as compared with wilting in old plants. The wilting process of unpollinated and self-pollinated flowers started in the early morning and lasted till afternoon. Cross-pollinated flowers wilted independently of the hour of the day. The role of flower-wilting as a means of communication to the environment with regard to pollination of the style is discussed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",Flower wilting; Incompatibility; Petunia hybrida; Pollen tube; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001364314

These models were tested on independent data obtained from plantings made from 1973 to 1976. The base temperatures for the computation of G.D.D. were found to be -1.3¦C for Sunfola 68-2 and -5.9¦C for Hysun-30. Daylength affected both phenology and leaf number during the emergence to head visible stage (E-HV). The data suggested that Sunfola 68-2 was either day-neutral or had a short-day response, and Hysun-30 a long-day photoperiod requirement. These differences led to the development of different models for the prediction of 50F. The model for Sunfola 68-2 used G.D.D. with no adjustment for daylength, but daylength adjustment was necessary for Hysun-30.

The results show that the levels of both enzyme and inhibitor activities fluctuate during the course of differentiation in maize plants. The inhibitor is probably not a phenolic substance, as indicated by the fact that it is unaffected by PVP in the medium and shows varying effectiveness against alcohol dehydrogenases from different organisms. During kernel development (from the 15th day after pollination to the dry seed) the specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in maize scutellum remains high, and subsequently declines sharply after the onset of germination. The rapid and selective elimination of alcohol dehydrogenase in various maize tissues during development seems to be mediated by the endogenous ADH inhibitor. Density-labelling experiments show that very little alcohol dehydrogenase is synthesized de novo during early germination under normal conditions, but that de novo synthesis can be induced by subjecting the seedlings to anaerobiosis. © 1977, International Society of Differentiation.

An alate with a small colony of nymphs was found on 26 April, indicating that migration from the south starts early in the spring. Early migrants colonized winter barley, but not winter oats, rye, or wheat. Colonization on field corn did not occur until over a month after plant emergence. Only small numbers of alatae initiated infestations on corn and the large variation in size of aphid infestations observed at pollination was due to differences in the longevity and fecundity of these few early attackers. The whorl leaves which enclosed the tassel before pollination provided a very favorable environment for rapid development of the aphids. Trapping of alatae in yellow pans of water at the periphery of a corn field in the fall showed that a minimum temperature of 13°C was required for flight. At a constant temperature of 25.5°C and a 1ight:dark photoperiod of 14: 10 h, the average prereproductive, reproductive, and postreproductive periods for 29 aphids were 5.9, 15.8, and 9.6 days, respectively.

It is shown that, so long as inbreeding does not depress the vigour and fitness of parents, heterosis in hybrids between them will be greater than that obtained in hybrids between open-pollinated parents. The expression derived tor heterosis for characters governed by two genes has brought to focus the possibilities of obtaining heterosis without the presence of dominance etfects, and also of dominance interactions. Arguments are advanced to illustrate that pure dominance hypothesis alone cannot account tor the observed heterosis when the character is under the control of more than one gene. It is found feasible that pure additive gene action at individual genic level coupled with a favourable additive x additive interaction can produce heterosis when gene frequency differences can be ensured.

The Arachnis and Vanda genera are represented in Malaya by the following species, Arachnis flos-aeris (L) Rchb.f., Arachnis maingayi (Hook.f.) Schltr., Arachnis hookeriana Rchb.f., Vanda hookeriana Rchb.f. and Vanda helvola Bl. (Holttum 1953). The Arandas, typical of Malayan orchid hybrids with a vigorous growth habit and requiring full sun, retain the Arachnis form and shape but have broader sepals and petals. Inadequacy of cytogenetic studies has impeded hybridization work, random crossings have resulted in time and labour wasted. The Arandas are generally found to be sterile and have limited possibilities for further breeding (Pollination records of the Singapore Botanic Gardens). No successful interspecific crosses among the Arandas have been recorded. The following Arandas, Aranda HILDA GALISTAN, Aranda EILEEN ADDISON, Aranda LUCY LAYCOCK and Aranda NANCY, though found to produce seeds, have only very few plants of each fertile (Yeoh 1963). Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that at least two trigeneric hybrids involving the Arandas have been successfully produced, Ridleyara FASCAD (Aranda EILEEN Addison × Trichoglottis fasciata) and Holttumara COCHINEAL (Aranda HILDA GALISTAN × Renanthera coccinea). Aranda HILDA GALISTAN (Tanaka and Kamemoto 1961) and Aranda NAEROK (Kamemoto and Shindo 1964) have been reported to have a diploid chromosome number of 38, with irregular meiosis and poor chromosome pairing. This somatic number is to be expected since the majority of the parental species have 38 chromosomes. The main objective of this study is thus to understand the sterility of the Arandas through analysis of chromosomal behaviour and the extent of chromosome irregularities during microsporogenesis, of common representative members and parental species where available. © 1977, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

During its development the MMC attains a size much larger than that of the surrounding somatic cells and accumulates a considerable amount of food-storage substances. These consist of starch and droplets which could be, at least partly, of lipidic nature. During prophase I the MMC becomes a fully polarized cell since all or almost all the mitochondria are restricted to the chalazal cytoplasm. In the authors opinion this is determined by the trophically privileged position of the chalazal cytoplasm. The polarization of the chondriome determines the course of the subsequent events in such a way that the meiotic divisions give rise to a linear triad, in which the two micropylar megaspores soon degenerate while the chalazal one inherits all of the mithochondria from the megasporocyte and remains functional. On the other hand the food-storage substances appear more or less uniformly distributed at all megasporogenesis stages. The preparation for the female gametophyte development should therefore be accomplished via an accumulation of the cell organelles necessary for the consumption of the food-storage substances, rater than via an accumulation of the food-storage substances themselves. The latter may in fact be supplied later by the nearby vascular system. This behaviour of the megasporocyte of C. lawsoniana is discussed in connection with that previously observed in Encepbalartos poggei and in Ginkgo biloba. In the EM preparations the primary wall of the megasporocyte appears thicker than that of the adjacent cells. After the first meiotic division the wall separating the dyad from the tapetum shows different thickenings on the two sides. Finally, new wall material is laid down by the cytoplasm of the chalazal functional megaspore. These thickenings seem to occlude, at least partially, the plasmodesmata connecting at early stages the fertile cytoplasm to the somatic. The ultrastructural features of the nucellus are briefly described. We observe a gradual morphological change from the innermost nucellar cells, which form the tapetum and are less differentiated, to the external ones showing thicker walls, greater vacuolation and more starch. Some nucellar cells divide, while some others, mainly in the tapetum region, degenerate. The walls of the apical nucellar cells show very electron-transparent inclusions. These are considered to be the sites of enzymatic activities which should initially produce the pollination drop, and then the separation and degeneration of the above cells. Ovules with megasporocytes or whole triads degenerating have been frequently observed. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-10344252561

The genus Lissocephala has achieved a novel adaptive direction in the Ethiopian region. All known African species are strictly specialized on Ficus. This species diversity suggests that ecological transfer to Ficus preceded the Lissocephala radiation. Lissocephala larvae breed inside immature figs. The eggs are laid in or near the fig ostiole. First instar larvae enter the fig receptacle though the ostiolar entrance is constantly closed by firmly imbricating bracts. Third instar larvae leave the fig by crawling out between the ostiolar bracts, and drop to the soil where they pupate. Thus Lissocephala species larvae breed inside a sheltered microhabitat, since the numerous other sympatric sycophagous Drosophilids do not have the ability to colonize immature figs. Other groups of Drosophilid species breed successively on the ripening exocarp of the fig following the successive microbial states of the fig. The possibility of coevolution of Lissocephala species, Ficus species and pollinator fig wasp species is discussed. Selection for avoidance of competition increased Lissocephala species' efficiency in exploiting unutilized immature figs and then provided a conspicuous niche separation which contributed to species packing on figs. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008125354

Bridges iri coenocytic endosperm of wheat-rye genotypes are caused at anaphase by the failure of rye chromosomes to separate at the telomeres where late replicating DNA is known to be located. The frequency of occurrence of aberrant nuclei in endosperms of the seven disomic chromosome addition lines of King II rye to Holdfast wheat fixed at the end of the coenocytic stage is significantly lower in three addition lines lacking a large telomeric block of terminal heterochromatin on one arm (due to its deletion) than in the remaining four addition lines without deletions of terminal heterochromatin. Evidence is presented showing a significant positive correlation between the proportion of aberrant nuclei in endosperms of six hexaploid triticales during the first 4 days after pollination, and the degree of grain shrivelling scored at maturity. It is concluded that the reduction or elimination of segments of late replicating DNA from rye chromosomes should be a major object in the breeding of economically useful triticales, and the means of achieving this goal are discussed. © 1977 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017659757

Treated patients received cumulative doses prior to and during treatment ranging from 1.4 × 105 to 4.8 × 106 protein nitrogen units (PNU). IgG antibody to ragweed antigen E (AgE) was measured by radioimmunoprecipitation, while IgE antibody to allergens in crude ragweed extract was measured by the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The RAST procedure was calibrated using a serum whose content of IgE antibody in nanograms per milliliter had been determined by immunoabsorption, and with this method the absolute quantities of IgE antibodies to ragweed allergens could be measured. Control experiments indicated that the IgG antibodies in the sera of the treated patients did not interfere with the measurements of IgE antibodies. The levels of IgE antibody in serum varied from less than 5 ng/ml to approximately 3,000 ng/ml. IgE antibodies decreased from October, 1973, to July, 1974, and rose sharply from July to October, 1974, following the pollination season. In both untreated and treated patient groups the magnitudes of the decreases were related (p &lt; 0.001) to the levels of IgE antibody in October, and the magnitudes of the rises were related to the levels of IgE antibody in July. In the treated patients with IgE antibody less than 71 ng/ml in October, the rate of decrease (October to July) was less than in the untreated patients. Comparison of the rises in IgE antibody from July to October revealed that these were partially suppressed in the treated group (p &lt; 0.001), and this effect was most marked in patients with July levels less than 36 ng/ml. Levels of IgG antibody to AgE in the treated patients were approximately 70-fold greater than in untreated patients and showed little change over the study period. The levels of IgG and IgE antibody in the treated patients were positively correlated (p &lt; 0.001) at all time periods, and patients with high levels of IgG antibody also had greater declines and rises in IgE antibodies. The results indicate that immunotherapy is associated with (1) a reduction in the seasonal decrease in IgE antibody from October to July in patients with the low levels of IgE antibody, (2) a partial suppression of the rises in IgE antibody from July to October, and (3) that both these effects are related to the level of IgE antibody before the change. In many treated patients both IgE and IgG antibodies were low in spite of parenteral administration of ragweed extract. This result is consistent with the view that overall humoral immunologic reactivity to ragweed antigens is reduced in these patients. © 1977.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017649027

The bulbs of the typical Haryana red-round variety of Allium cepa var. cepa range continuously from flat globes and pyriform bulbs to torpedos. Breeders, in general, have a selection bias towards the large sized round bulbs. Hence, knowledge about the genetic parameters of the bulb traits of onion will be highly useful to breeders in predicting effectiveness of the selection and in determining the choice of the breeding procedure. During such a study, from the progeny of a population of red onion bulbs, white bulbs segregated. These were further cultured and in the subsequent generation 7 bulbs carrying translocation and 2 bulbs exhibiting desynapsis were detected. Their detection was possible because they were seedless. In these translocation heterozygotes, interchanges involved all the eight non-homologous chromosomes of the Allium zygotic complement but in an entirely novel way. In each case, 2 non-homologous chromosomes were involved in a reciprocal exchange, thus resulting in the formation of 4 well organised chromosomal associations and culminating in total seed sterility. Such a translocation system that is so regular in pattern and involves the whole zygotic complement seems to be undocumented so far and is reported for the first time in white onion in the present paper. © 1977, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Experimentation with living populations has shown that Solanum taxonomy is complicated by several factors. In addition to the historical factors, phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation, the existence of a polyploid series, and the possibilities of interspecific hybridization accompanied by various pre? and post?zygotic isolating mechanisms are dealt with. The various taxonomic categories attached to Solanum accessions during earlier classical studies derive support from the crossability behaviour of the taxa concerned. Morphological divergence is generally accompanied by genetical isolation which can manifest itself at any time between pollination and the maturation of the F2 progeny.

In every case, the value of F rapidly approached an equilibrium value which depended largely on the amount of cross-fertilization and very little on the higher seed total set or amount of selfing on less inbred plants. There was no indication of any fluctuation in F from generation to generation when the proportion of cross-fertilization was constant. The possibility of reducing the coefficients of inbreeding of generations likely to be used on the farm (syn-4 and later) by hand pollination instead of open pollination of the parents and by promoting cross-pollination by artificial increases in numbers of bees or adjustment of environmental factors during multiplication were examined. Although the method of parental pollination had little effect, induced increases in bee activity led to significant reductions in F when the ambient frequency of bee pollinations was low. The generation at which this procedure gave the maximum effect was the final generation of seed increase (syn-3), but an alternative would be for farmers to use bees on the first commercial crop. In any case, only seed from crops with adequate bee pollination should be used to sow commercial crops. As the breeding system was shown to be effectively very similar to one in which all plants are equally self-fertile, it should be possible to take account of the number (n) and coefficients of inbreeding (F0) and interrelationship (r0) of the parents, and to predict the yield of advanced generations using formulae given by Busbice (1969, 1970). © 1977, Cambridge University Press.

A striking chromosomal polymorphism was found in twenty plants raised from seeds collected from four natural populations. All four populations had unique satellite and marker chromosome constitutions. Further chromosomal polymorphism was observed among plants originating from one of these populations. There were similarities in the appearance of the satellite chromosomes in E. diae, E. rechingeri and E. striatulus which denotes a close relationship between the three species. This is ascertained by a karyotype analysis of a polyhaploid individual of E. diae. The genome formula J4J4J4J4J5J5J6J66 or J4J4J4J4J1J1J6J66 was suggested for the species. Analysis of the satellite and marker chromosomes in 33 plants raised from seeds obtained in the greenhouse, following open pollination, inferred a predominance of self?fertilization or intrapopulation crosses. Aneuploids were found among plants raised from seeds collected in nature or obtained in the greenhouse. During meiosis, paired chromosomes usually appeared as bivalents and rarely as multivalents. Univalents occurred frequently which might be related to the prevailing chromosomal polymorphism. In the polyhaploid, most of the pollen mother cells had 47 bivalents which evidenced the presence of two closely related genomes.

The oldest acceptable records of angiosperms are rare monosulcate pollen grains with columellar exine structure from probable Barremian strata of England, equatorial Africa, and the Potomac Group, and small, simple, pinnately veined leaves with several orders of reticulate venation from the Neocomian of Siberia and the basal Potomac Group. The relatively low diversity and generalized character of these fossils and the subsequent coherent pattern of morphological diversification are consistent with a monophyletic origin of the angiosperms not long before the Barremian. PatuxentArundel floras (Barremian-early Albian?) of the Potomac Group include some pollen and leaves with monocotyledonous features as well as dicotyledonous forms. Patuxent angiosperm pollen is strictly monosulcate and has exine sculpture indicative of insect pollination. Rare Patuxent-Arundel angiosperm leaves are generally small, have disorganized venation, and are largely restricted to sandy stream margin lithofacies; the largest are comparable to and may include ancestors of woody Magnoliidae adapted to understory conditions. Patapsco floras (middle to late Albian?) contain rapidly diversifying tricolpate pollen and several new complexes of locally abundant angiosperm leaves. Ovate-cordate and peltate leaves in clayey pond lithofacies may includeancestors of aquatic Nymphaeales and Nelumbonales. Pinnatifid and later pinnately compound leaves with increasingly regular venation which are abundant just above rapid changes in sedimentation are interpreted as early successional ""weed trees"" transitional to but more primitive than the modern subclass Rosidae. Apparently related palmately lobed, palinactinodromous leaves which develop rigidly percurrent tertiary venation and become abundant in uppermost Potomac stream margin deposits (latest Albian-early Cenomanian?) are interpreted as riparian trees ancestral to the order Hamamelidales. Comparisons of dated pollen floras of other regions indicate that one major subgroup of angiosperms, tricolpate-producing dicots (i.e., excluding Magnoliidae of Takhtajan) originated in the Aptian of Africa-South America at a time of increasing aridity and migrated poleward into Laurasia and Australasia. However, the earlier (Barremian) monosulcate phase of the angiosperm record is represented equally in Africa-South America and Laurasia before marked climatic differentiation between the two areas. These trends are considered consistent with the hypothesis that the angiosperms originated as small-leafed shrubs of seasonally arid environments, and underwent secondary expansion of leaf area and radiated into consecutively later successional stages and aquatic habitats after entering mesic regions as riparian ""weeds,"" as opposed to the concept that they arose as trees of mesic forest environments. © 1977 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009850235

A strong pollen trimorphism is associated with differences in stamen and style length in the three floral forms. The results of a controlled pollination programme with thirty individual plants of P. rotundifolia demonstrate that floral trimorphism is accompanied by a physiological self?incompatibility system typical of many heterostylous plants. Legitimate pollinations are considerably more productive of seed than illegitimate pollinations. Individual plants exhibit differences in the strength of self?incompatibility, but in general, short?styled plants possess the strongest self?incompatibility, long?styled plants are intermediate and mid?styled plants have the weakest self?incompatibility. Large differences in the strength of self?incompatibility are expressed in self?pollinations with pollen from the two anther levels of each style form. Natural populations of P. rotundifolia often contain only a single style form or contain unequal proportions of style forms. Seed set, resulting from moderate self?compatibility, occurred in a Cosra Rican population that contained only short?styled plants. Two populations associated with rice cultivation in the Lower Amazon contained equal proportions of the three style forms. The seed set of the three forms within these populations was similar.

Development commences when specialized endosperm cells adjacent to the maternal nucellar layer start to differentiate. Differentiation is characterized by the formation of aleurone protein bodies and spherosomes. The protein bodies of the aleurone layer have a vacuolar origin whereas the protein bodies of the immediate underlying endosperm cells appear to develop from protrusions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, two morphologically and developmentally distinct types of protein bodies are present in these adjacent tissues. The spherosomes of the aleurone layer form early in the development of this tissue and increase in number as the tissue matures. During the final stages of maturation, these spherosomes become closely apposed to the aleurone grains and the plasma membrane. No further changes are apparent in the structure of the aleurone cells after 40 days from pollination when the caryopsis begins to desiccate. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",Aleurone; Endosperm; Protein bodies; Spherosomes; Zea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002601119

The study areas were in the Main?Spessart district. Bumblebees and honeybees show different daily activity. On warm days bumblebees chiefly fly in the evening and somewhat less frequently in the morning. On such days honeybees are most active at noon?time, when bublebees hardly are. On cool days honeybees stop visiting blossoms, whereas bumblebees only postpone their main activity to the afternoon. Only in exceptional cases honeybees and bumblebees are equally active throughout a day. Bumblebee queens and workers show the same daily activity. Bumblebee queens visit two to three times as many blossoms as honeybees in the same lapse of time. Big and small species indicate no difference concerning the quickness of visiting flowers. Bumblebee workers are somewhat slower than queens, but still quicker than honeybees. As far as morello cherries are concerned, bumblebees shift more often from tree to tree and are less constant on certain varieties than honeybees. The most abundant bumblebees ascertained in the study area on fruit tree blossoms were the three big species with short probosces: B. lapidarius, B. lucorum, and B. terrestris. In May 1973 workers of the species B. pratorum, and B. terrestris/lucorum could be seen in a greater number on blossoming apples and morello cherries. As bumblebees are less constant in visiting certain varieties and less sensitive to low temperatures they can become of economic importance to certain plantations and in certain years. In case that the use of bumblebee colonies for pollinating fruit trees is planned, the species B. terrestris, B. lucorum, B. lapidarius, B. pratorum and B. hypnorum and recommended. In den Jahren 1969, 1970, 1973, 1975 und 1976 wurde der Besuch von blühenden Obstbäumen (Malus silvestris, Prunus avium, Prunus cerasus) durch Hummeln und Honigbienen vergleichend untersucht. Die Untersuchungsgebiete lagen im Main?Spessart?Kreis (Nordbayern). Die Aktivitätszeiten von Hummeln und Bienen ergänzen einander. An warmen Tagen fliegen die Hummeln verstärkt in den Abendstunden und etwas weniger häufig in den Morgenstunden. Die Hauptaktivität der Bienen fällt an solchen Tagen in die Mittagsstunden, in denen die Hummeln kaum aktiv sind. Bei kühlem Wetter stellen die Bienen den Blütenbesuch ein, während die Hummeln ihre Hauptaktivität in die Nachmittagsstunden verlagern. Nur in Ausnahmefällen zeigen Hummeln und Honigbienen eine gleiche tages?zeitliche Aktivität. In ihrer Aktivitätsverteilung stimmen Hummelarbeiterinnen und Hummelköniginnen überein. Hummelköniginnen besuchen in der gleichen Zeiteinheit wie Bienen zwei? bis dreimal so viele Blüten. Große und kleine Arten zeigen keine Unterschiede in der Schnelligkeit des Blütenbesuchs. Arbeiterinnen sind im Blütenbesuch langsamer als die Königinnen, aber noch immer schneller als Honigbienen. Die Hummeln wechseln auf Sauerkirschen schneller von Baum zu Baum und sind weniger sortenstetig als Honigbienen. Als häufigste Hummeln (62,499,5%) auf blühenden Obstbäumen wurden im Untersuchungsgebiet die drei großen, kurzrüßligen Arten B. lapidarius, B. lucorum und B. terrestris ermittelt. Im Mai 1973 konnten Arbeiterinnen der Arten B. pratorum und B. terrestris/lucorum in größerer Zahl auf Apfel? und Sauerkirschblüten beobachtet werden. Auf Grund ihrer geringeren Sortenstetigkeit und ihrer Unempfindlichkeit gegen niedrige Temperaturen können die Hummeln in bestimmten Jahren und in bestimmten Anpflanzungen wirtschaftliche Bedeutung erlangen.

However, in this early stage, there is only little difference found in the protein pattern of selfed and crossed ovaries. From 12 h after pollination and onwards, the difference between pollinated and unpollinated ovaries becomes very obvious, as does also the difference between crossed and selfed ovaries. At 24 h after pollination many different proteins exist in crossed and selfed ovaries. From 32 h to 48 h after pollination the crossed ovaries differentiate further on, whereas the ovaries after self-pollination show more and more proteins which were also found in the unpollinated ovaries of that age.

Pollinator flight distances were directly proportional to spacing parameters while the frequency of interplant flights and percent pollination were inversely proportional to spacing parameters. These findings show that gene flow is reduced by pollinator activity over a wide range of spacing parameters but in populations with low spacing means highly localized gene exchange can occur within the colony. Isolation of colonies may be expected under these circumstaces and cleistogamy may be the optimal breeding system. However, chasmogamous flowers may be important both in promoting within-colony gene exchange and long distance between-colony gene exchange corresponding to the sexual functions proposed in several recent models. Viola colonies appear to be semi-isolated demes with pollinator service which can bring adaptive genes to high localized frequencies, but which maintains low frequency, long-distance gene dispersal.

Seagrasses, in the family Cymodoceaceae, are the only wholly marine group of flowering plants which carry out their entire life cycle in the sea1. The male and female flowers are borne on different plants. Consequently, their pollination mechanism presents intriguing problems, for terrestrial angiosperms, from which seagrasses presumably arose2,3, shed dry pollen. This becomes hydrated only after alighting on the female stigma, where recognition events determine acceptance or rejection of the pollen4. These events seem to involve interactions between surface proteins or glycoproteins borne by both pollen and stigma5. The pollen proteins are released on to the stigma during normal pollination 6,7, but are lost from the surface whenever pollen is wetted 8. The system found in terrestrial species could thus hardly operate with submarine pollination. We have found that adaptations have occurred in both pollen and stigma of the seagrasses, accommodating the pollination system to the marine environment. Changes in the shape and form of the pollens, together with the loss of the outer wall layer, make it possible for the pollen to be carried in water currents as long, rope-like masses. The receptive stigma cells secrete a proteinaceous surface layer that is not dispersed in seawater, providing a suitable medium for trapping the pollen during submarine pollination. © 1976 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000936587

Before pollination very feeble enzyme activity (acid phosphatase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase and peroxidase) was observed. Reserve substances were present in low amounts before pollination. Pollination stimulated the accumulation of several substances and enzymes in the tip of the nucellus, micropylar zone. Just prior to, during and after fertilization, the cells in the micropylar zone had strong reaction for several enzymes indicating temporary enhancement of metabolic activity in the micropylar zone. The role of antipodals in the storage of reserve food products and nutrition of embryo and early stages of endosperm development is discussed. The pattern of enzymatic changes within the embryo sac reflected the biochemical changes operative during quiescent and active stages. The nucellus of Zea mays contains many enzymes required for hydrolysis of reserved food substances. A role of acid phosphatase in autolysis of nucellar cells, after fertilization is suggested.

The method which was used intercepts the pollen flux of the atmosphere with a vertical filtering unit, which is exposed facing the direction of wind on the filtering door of the weather vane and collects much larger quantities of pollen than the other technique of collection. The atmospheric currents displace from one region to another numerous spores and pollens, the trajectories of which are directly influenced by the general circulation of the atmosphere. The density of these fluxes can be very large, reaching 2500 grains/m 3 of air at M.T.P.R. in the last week of January; the taxons collected are very numerous (more than 700). The atmospheric transfer of pollen modifies largely the pollen content of the atmosphere of different flowering domains. These interferences manifest themselves in the simplest cases by the presence of 2 peaks of concentration, the principal corresponding to the local efflorescence, the second to the pollen transferred from other regions. The pollen concentrations in the mountains are one third of those in the plains. Pollination in the mountains is several weeks late in comparison to the plain during the first semester, whereas during the second semester, it is the plains that show a certain delay.

These two species, D. sessile and D. smilacinum, represent extremes in both floral morphology and divergence in pollination within the section. The inverted flowers of D. sessile have an elongate floral tube formed by the imbrication of the oblanceolate tepals. The tepal bases are modified into well developed, saccate nectaries. The stamens have rigid, vertical filaments which tightly encircle the ovary-style axis, and extrorse anthers located within a floral cavity which can accommodate a large pollinator (cross-pollination). The stigma is exserted and the depth of its cleft formation constant. D. smilacinum, in contrast, has an open, nodding campanulate flower with lanceolate tepals which have only shallow nectaries at their bases. The stamens have widely divergent filaments with versatile anthers that have laterally introrse dehiscence (wind and/or self-pollination). The depth of the stigma cleft is variable. For both species, the pattern of differential UV absorption and reflectance is similar. It is suggested on morphological grounds and by pollinator observation, that D. sessile with a high energy flower requiring specialized visitors represents a more advanced condition than that observed in D. smilacinum, which is more generalized and primitive. Seasonal herbivore pressure on the tepal nectaries of D. sessile is discussed in relation to its pollination. © 1976 The Botanical Society of Japan.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51649191285

In a cross between a recessive trisomic with green base and white style (ccc ii ss) and a dominant disomic having purple base and purple style (CC II SS), all the F1 seedling progeny were purple based because of the presence of C, I and S. For C. to be expressed in seedling base, either I should be absent or S should be present with I. In style colour, however, irrespective of the presence of I and S, C produces purple phenotype. In one trisomic (Ccc ii ss) plant (designated as 4-15) of the F1 progeny, a part of the seedling base was green. All the tillers coming up from the green side of the main tiller also had green base, and those arising on the purple side were purple based. Similarly, the pistillate spikelets on the green side of the main culm and on the tillers with green base were white styled, and the male spikes showed 10 chromosomes. Female spikelets on the purple side of the main tiller and on the tillers with purple base were mostly purple styled and the male spikes had 11 chromosomes. In some of the purple based tillers, however, there were both 11 and 10 chromosomes in different regions or different inflorescence clusters on the tiller. In these tillers, where the chromosome number was 11, style colour was purple, and white style occurred when there were 10 chromosomes. In one tiller, the style colour was purple but the chromosome number was 10. The recessive phenotype of the style in the trisomic conceivably resulted from an elimination of the extra chromosome carrying the dominant allele C. On the basis of the morphological features of the extra chromosome, such as length, centromere position and distribution pattern of the hetero and eupycnotic regions, it was identified as chromosome No. 2 in the complement. It was therefore possible to place with certainty the gene c on this chromosome. Sometimes, however, the extra chromosome carrying c also was eliminated giving 10 chromosomes and purple style. In the other trisomic plants of the F1 progeny, one plant showed 11 chromosomes but in a tiller there were only 10 chromosomes and white styles. In two other plants, although the chromosome number was 11 throughout, white style was present in a single cluster of inflorescences in one plant, and in one pistillate spikelet in the other. In the latter two cases, white style was believed to have arisen as a result of a mutation from C to c or somatic crossing over, giving the genotype ccc in the affected regions. In a single plant, chromosome elimination was observed in only one cell. Apparently the 10-chromosome sectors arose from the 11-chromosome condition by selective elimination of the extra chromosome during mitosis in the primordium giving rise to these sectors. In the affected plants, elimination did not obviously occur at the same stage but at different times in their ontogeny. Instability is probably governed by one or a few major genes, associated with a number of modifiers, exhibiting incomplete penetrance and variable expression. Chromosome elimination did not apparently follow any particular pattern but was erratic. Probably some intracellular environment is necessary to trigger the mechanism governing the elimination into action. The unstable system, occurring in combination with other favourable features like the functional nature of the aneuploid gametes, sexual reproduction, monoecious condition favouring cross pollination and tolerance of extra chromosomes by the sporophyte, could be an important factor in the cytogenetic evolution of the species. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250392979

Most amino acids in sugar water were not detected at concentrations found in nectars. Higher amino acid concentrations generally resulted in rejection. Hummingbirds did not necessarily select food in the laboratory to maximize feeding efficiency, but under natural circumstances similar choices could result in optimal feeding efficiencies.

Developing seeds were fixed and stained at known intervals after pollination and the embryo sac contents dissected out for cytological examination. - In all cases, the pattern of development was similar to that previously described for the Triticeae. After intraspecific pollination, the rate of endosperm and embryo development was significantly faster in H. vulgare than in H. bulbosum. In hybrid tissues, the rate was intermediate, but often much nearer to that of H. vulgare at first. Elimination of H. bulbosum chromosomes occurred only during endosperm and embryo mitoses. Usually, 0-3 chromosomes were lost at any one division but up to 7 were lost at some. Elimination, which occurred as early as zygotic anaphase, was nearly or quite complete in all dividing cells in both embryo and endosperm after 5 days. The mean number of chromosomes lost per nucleus per nuclear cycle was low at first but rose rapidly and stayed high for about a day in each tissue before falling quickly. The rate of elimination in each tissue was maximal when that tissue first synthesized significant amounts of new cytoplasm (day 2 after pollination in the endosperm and day 3 in the embryo). At mitosis, chromosomes being eliminated differed from others only in failing to congress at metaphase or to reach a pole at anaphase or both. - It is noted that in several widely different examples where either haploids are produced when only hybrids are expected, or where chromosomes of one species are preferentially eliminated from hybrid cells, nucleolar activity was suppressed in chromosomes of the genome which was selectively or preferentially eliminated. Consequently, it is suggested that chromosome elimination in Hordeum hybrids may be caused by a disturbed control of protein metablism in hybrid seeds and perhaps H. bulbosum chromosomes are selectively eliminated because they are less efficient than H. vulgare chromosomes at forming normal attachments to spindle protein. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017258605

All such lines can be unequivocally classified into two elements that are morphologically distinguished, chiefly by differences in flower size and exsertion of the stigma. The stigmas of the large-flowered type are strongly exserted; those of the smaller, slightly or not at all. Both forms are sporadically dispersed in the central and northern Peruvian Andes, east of the continental divide. They are sympatric and often cohabit in the Apurimac-Ayacucho-Cuzco region. Despite this overlap of ranges and intermingling, intermediate types have not been found in nature, although they can be produced experimentally by reciprocal crosses between the two forms. The F1 hybrids are highly fertile, but seeds produced by self-pollination germinate poorly. Variation at the individual, populational, and higher levels was assessed in progeny tests of wild plants by analysis of 14 enzyme loci, of which eight proved to be polymorphic. The two taxa could be entirely distinguished by alternative alleles of Got-3; perfect agreement was also found in the sympatric region for alleles of Prx-3; a variable degree of differentiation exists at the other polymorphic loci. For the small-flowered taxon, all tested individuals were homozygous, and all members of a single population had identical genotype; furthermore, only limited differences at two loci were found in the eight tested accessions. In contrast, the larger-flowered type exhibits considerable variation in terms of intra- and interpopulational polymorphy, heterozygosity, and other evidence of outcrossing. With the aforementioned exception, all allozymes detected in the smaller-flowered form are known in the larger-flowered type. All evidence from flower morphology and measures of variability consistently alludes to appreciable outcrossing in the latter and strict autogamy in the former. Considerations of all lines of evidence lead to the conclusion that the self-pollinated entity is sufficiently differentiated from the outcrosser to deserve specific status. The former is named L. parviflorum, the latter, L. chmielewskii, and Latin diagnoses are presented. It is most likely that L. parviflorum evolved sympatrically from L. chmielewskii by virtue of its acquiring autogamous reproduction - an isolating mechanism that is apparently reinforced by poor reproductivity of the interspecific hybrids. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003014554

Accordingly, the number of florets visited depends completely on the time spent on the head. Air temperature and distance from the apiary within 800 metres failed to affect the time spent on umbels. In contrast, sky cover was inversely correlated to the time spent per inflorescences. Honeybees tended to visit middle section of heads most frequently. Much less bee touched the top and very few ones frequented the lower sections of umbels. It is suggested that at least 5 to 8 bee visits are needed for satisfactory pollination and/or seed setting of florets within umbels.

Three stages in flower-bud development were recognized. Flower buds took four months to reach anthesis and capsules were mature after some five months. The first flowers appear two or three years after the seed has been sown and a generation could be completed within four years. The material examined was in conformity with most features of the subgenus Symphyomyrtus. The flowers are mainly insect pollinated, especially by honey bees, and they are mainly protandrous. Controlled pollination operations and precautions to be taken against contamination during these operations are described. Seed was produced from cross-pollination done at anthesis and for a period of seven days or more thereafter, but pollen did not begin to germinate on the stigma till the second day after anthesis. Maximum seed yield was obtained after cross-pollination done on the fifth day, at which time the stigmas were beginning to become swollen and sticky. Although self-fertilized seed was obtained after pollination at later flower stages, very little seed was produced after self-pollination done during the first two days after anthesis.

Males of the following genera of Hymenoptera Aculeata are involved as far as known hitherto: Camp?soscolia, Argogorytes, Colletes, Andrena s. lato, Eucera, Tetralonia, Anthophora, and Melecta. The volatile compounds of the flowers responsible for the specific behaviour release are probably mainly cyclic sesquiterpene alcohols and hydrocarbons. Processes of co?evolution may be assumed to have been functioning in the creation of the Ophrys pollination groups. Polinización de las orquideas del género Ophrys El Fenómeno biológico. Las orquidas del género Ophrys son polinizadas exclusivaments, o casi exclusivamente, por los machos de ciertos tipos de Hymenóptera Aculeata. Las flores no secretan néctar. Cuando los machos Hymenóptera Aculeate. Las flores no secretan néctar. Cuando los machos Hymenóptera son atraido a colocarse sobre las flores de Ophrys, el labelo ocasiona un comportamiento equivalente a la introducción en la cópula; de esta forma el polen se libera y la polinización se efectúa. Hasta ahora se ha constatado que los géneros de Hymenóptera Aculeata involucrados en este proseso son; Campsocolia, Argogorytes, Colletes, Andrena s. lato, Eucera, Tetralonia, Anthophora y Melecta. En lo que se refiere al estudio de los estimulos que funcionan en el proceso de polinization de las flores de Ophrys a través de la excitación sexual de los machos de Hymenóptera Aculeate, pueden extraerse las siguientes conclusiones. La estimulación olfatica es sin luger a dudas un  asi llamado  estimulo clave. La estimulación táctil es tamibién de gran importancia como estimulo clave. La estructura caracteristica de la epidermins en la parte superior del labelo de Ophrys asi como la sólida construcción del mismo, son necesarias para los movimientos dirigidos tactilmente y los giros sobre el mismo. Quimica de los productos volátiles de las flores Ophrys. Hemos determinado que las flores despiden peque?as cantidades de compuestos alifáticos simples, asi como compuestos isoprénicos, especialmente alcoholes e hidrocarburos sesquiterpénicos ciclicos. Tambjén se ba constatado la presencia de algunos monoterpenos. Hasta ahora hemos investigado 28 especies y subspecies. Los productos volaatiles de las flores Ophrys han sido investigados por medio de cromatografia gaseosa y espectrometria de masas. Comparando estos datos con datos de compuestos de referencia, hemos podido identificar algunos tipos de sesquiterpenos. Conclusiones. Las caracteristicas quimicas y morfológicas de las flores de Ophrys, que las distinguen de otras especies de orquideas de parentesco cercano, puede con buena razón, suponerse que sean adaptadas, si se considera la regularidad en la ocurrencia de sus propiedades dentro del gran grupo de las orquideas Ophrydoideae en cuestión, claramente correlacionada con la entomogamia especializada. La flor Ophrys deberia considerarse como una flor adaptable. Las especies Ophrys están  por su polinización  adaptadas al instinto de copulación de los machos de ciertos tipos de hymenóptera Aculeata. La biologia de polinización caracteristica del género Ophrys ofrece un espectro de ligaduras de distinta fuerza, en un extremo con la especie más estrictamente especializada O. speculum y en el otro, la especie menos estrictamente especializada O. apifera parcialmente polinizada por Eucera y, parcialmente autopolinizadsa. Las especies restantes se ubican en el medio.

Though heterosis in terms of abundant pollen production could be a factor in the self-pollinating ability of hybrids, some of the inbred lines were capable of self pollination despite limited pollen production, because the structure of the flower permitted the pollen to reach the stigma via a short route. The floral features associated with the ability to self-pollinate in the inbred lines included a relatively short style bending at more or less a right angle, few and short stylar hairs and stigmatic papillae, and less pronounced ridges on the inside of the keel petals.

During our study, it was observed to feed on only five species of plant and mainly on the nectar-producing parts (flowers and nectaries) of four of these species. It spent most of its feeding time licking nectar from the flowers of the kapok tree, Ceiba pentandra, and is probably a major pollinator of this tree in Madagascar.

These amphidiploids showed gigantism over the diploid F1 hybrids in all morphological features recorded, but fruit setting did not occur in spite of artificial pollination of the female flowers. Meiotic studies revealed the occurrence of Univalents, bivalents, trivalents, quadrivalents and at times higher chromosome associations both at diakinesis and metaphase I. Consequently many irregularities were observed at anaphase I. The occurrence of high frequencies of multivalents in the amphidiploids in which on the basis of preferential pairing only bivalents are expected, indicates autosyndetic or intragenomic pairing between the chromosomes. This is an indication of considerable segmental homology between some pairs of chromosomes of the two species. Sterility in the amphidiploid may be partly chromosomal, due to univalents and multivalents, but mainly the sterility appears to be genic. The genic sterility originales as an isolating mechanism bringing about speciation.

Five-month-old seedlings grown from the cross-pollinated seeds were transplanted in pots and put under the canopy of the Cryptomeria stand suffering from attack by the gall midge. In the next year, the seedlings were seriously infested. Statistically significant differences in injury were found among families. Resistant clone Nagasaki-syo-1 transmitted its resistance more or less to all its progenies. On the other hand, another resistant clone Huzitu-10 produced susceptible families except one mated with the resistant clone Nagasaki-syo-1. Thus, these two resistant clones seem to be different in their genetic background. Possible segregation could be seen in some families but not in others. The results described above suggest that gall midge resistance is probably controlled by plural loci of major genes. Natural inoculation of the same seedlings was repeated in the next year by the same method, but the injury was far less serious this time.

Very few bees scrabbled delibrately for pollen only. Pollen gathering seemed to be resulted automatically while bees collected for nectar. Bees do not seem to be steadfast in their behaviour on red clover fields. The proportion of pollen gatherers and also the dominant behaviour of individual field bees during flower visiting trips and even their behaviour on individual flowers seem to be primarily dependent on the availability of nectar in red clover flowers. The percentual ratio of major behavioural classes shifted during the flowering period. Highly significant negative relationship has been demonstrated between the time elapsed from the commencement of the flowering period and the ratio of pollen gatherers. In contrast, significant positive correlation has been shown between the time elapsed and the proportion of secondary robbers. However, the proportion of major behaviour classes proved to be independent of the honeybee density and weather conditions like the air temperature, the cloud cover and the wind velocity. These facts again support the primary influence of the availability of nectar and point out the impact of short tongued primary robber bumblebees biting holes at the base of the corolla tube on the behaviour of honeybee populations visiting blooming red clover fields. Nevertheless, the effect might not be so serious, since, most of the secondary robbers enter flowers also on a regular way and so contribute to their pollination.

When a hive entrance opened directly on to the brood area of a colony, a greater proportion of bees using it collected pollen than when it opened on to an area of the hive with storage comb only, and the proportion of pollen gatherers could be diminished or increased by moving brood combs near to or far from the entrance. Relatively more bees left than entered by an entrance near the brood, particularly when the brood was adjacent to the lower entrance. On return from foraging, bees tended to remain faithful to one entrance only, but the presence of a queen excluder obstructed the movement of foragers within the hive and, as a consequence, there was a greater tendency for the bees to change entrances in accordance with a change in the position of the brood. By manipulating the size and shape of the hive entrance it was possible to direct returning foragers to the brood combs, and hence to increase their tendency to collect pollen and thus their pollinating efficiency.

This paper is based on data taken during the first two years' growth in a nearby nursery at Placerville, California. Ten of the thirteen growth, size, and needle morphological characteristics had significant differences between population samples, while eleven characteristics had significant differences between open-pollinated families within the population samples. High-elevation population samples were smaller in size and needle measurements, had fewer adaxial stomatal rows, blunter needle tips, and a shorter growing season. Most characteristic values were distributed ecotypically between the two lower- and the two higher-elevation population samples. Analyses of the patterns of variation demonstrated that characteristics of size and growth showed greater differentiation between population samples than did characteristics of needle morphology. It was concluded that the differences between characteristic patterns were caused by the more intense selection pressures acting upon the characteristics of size and growth. No consistent differences were discovered between these population samples in terms of total amounts of within-population genetic variation. The failure to find differences in intra-population variation may be due to the high rates of migration that probably exist within such a transect, and the fact that none of the populations included in this study are truly marginal. There were large differences between characteristics for total within-population variation; a positive but non-significant correlation was found between high coefficients of variation and those characteristics with much differentiation between populations. It is postulated that the maintenance of this intra-population variation was caused by microhabitat adaptations and gene flow. Evidence for increased genetic variation within open-pollinated families due to pollen immigration is presented, and its implications discussed. © 1976 Springer Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007048511

Moench) was produced by pollinating sugarcane inflorescences with sorghum pollen. The BG population, produced by backcrossing twice with diploid (2=20) and then twice with tetraploid (2=40) sorgo, probably combined 40 Sorghum and 4-10 Saccharum chromosomes. The cytological observations suggest that different combinations of sugarcane and sorghum chromosomes are retained in different BG individuals. The sugarcane chromosomes either associate loosely with sorghum bivalents and/or tetravalents or pair autosyndetically. The sorghum chromosomes do not behave as in normal sorghum in the presence of sugarcane chromosomes and cytoplasm. Cytological studies of Saccharum- Sorghum hybrid derivatives suggest that interaction between their genomes can take place. Selling of these BG plants results in almost complete elimination of Saccharum chromosomes, and morphologically and cytologically modified tetraploid sorghums with In=40 chromosomes are recovered.

The anatropous, pendulous and crassinucellate ovule was initially unitegmic; later, the integument split close to the micropyle, forming a partial second integument. After anthesis there was a development of a hypostase and an obturator. The development of the Polygonum?type embryo sac followed division of a megaspore mother cell, giving a tetrad or triad of megaspores. The functional megaspore was the chalazal one. The ovary developed into a mature pericarp after anthesis, even when pollination was prevented, and before the zygote divided. Therefore, the fruit can be parthenocarpic. The ovule started to grow after initiation of embryo development until it filled the cavity within the pericarp. The zygotes were dormant for 418 weeks after pollination. In P. saportae reproduction became arrested during the development of the embryo sac; only very few abnormal embryos were found. No fixed pattern of embryo development could be discerned. The endosperm was initially nuclear, becoming cellular when the embryo started to develop. The seed coat was derived from the integument and the remnants of the nucellus.

RH-531 and RH-532 applied at or before booting stage caused rather large reduction in plant height while RH-2956 had a small effect on height. Application of any of the three chemicals on 'Anza' at meiotic stages reduced self-pollination (SP) fertility by 97-99%. If 90% SP fertility reduction is acceptable, the application time could vary from premeiosis to postmeiosis for 'Anza'. 'Yecora 70' was less sensitive than 'Anza' to gametocide treatments. The lowest SP fertility obtained in 'Yecora 70' with RH-531, RH-532, and RH-2956 was by treatment at booting (4 kg/ha), at premeiosis (2 kg/ha), and heading (8 kg/ha), and the corresponding SP fertility reductions were 74, 89, and 71%. Pollen stainability-determined by aceto-carmine, IKI, and Alexander's stains-was not affected by gametocide treatment and was not useful in evaluating sterility induced by these chemicals. For the RH-531-treated 'Anza' and 'Yecora 70' and the RH-532-treated 'Anza', more than 94% of the seeds produced by open-pollination on treated plants were from self-or sib-pollination as determined by progeny testing. However, RH-532-treated 'Yecora 70' and RH-2956-treated 'Anza' and 'Yecora 70' did result in more crossed seeds, with a maximum of 20% outcrossing. It was believed that spike compactness induced by the chemicals and the related poor flower opening were the major limitations for outcrossing. Artificial pollinations made to the test varieties showed that RH-531 induced both male and female sterility and was undesirable for practical use. RH-532, however, could be applied at the booting stage to avoid severe female sterility, and RH-2956 clearly was the best of the three chemicals, with the female fertility very close to those of the untreated checks of both 'Anza' and 'Yecora 70'. Of the three chemicals, RH-2956 gave the highest percentage of hybrid plants in the progeny of hand-or open-pollinated spikes. Its practical use for hybrid seed production, however, will depend largely on improvement of methods to increase cross pollination in wheat. © 1976 H.

Pollen was divided into six classes based on shape and contents of the grains. With acetocarmine, fuchsin, peroxidase and germination in vitro 4, 3, 2 and 1 classes, respectively, are supposed to be included in the percentage of 'good' pollen as measured by these methods. This percentage therefore, in more than 96% of the cases studied, shows a decrease in the order indicated. Neither aging of pollen at room conditions nor collecting pollen from flowers on 1-9 days after anthesis does influence the percentage of 'good' pollen with acetocarmine and fuchsin, whereas this percentage drops sharply to zero with peroxidase and germination in vitro. The latter two methods apparently measure as 'good' pollen only the grains with living cytoplasm. When pollen is collected at three successive dates from the same flowers the percentage of 'good' pollen drops sharply with all methods used. There is a relation between quantity of pollen per flower and pollen quality (% 'good'), low-quantity pollen containing significantly lower percentages of 'good' pollen than medium- and high-quantity pollen. The latter two are not significantly different in this respect. From calculations of correlation coefficients it is concluded that only germination of pollen in vitro is significantly correlated with berry and seed set and thus gives a reliable estimate of male fertility. This does not hold true for the two staining methods without due reserve. The peroxidase method is not useful for the Solanum material studied. After standardized pollination the average number of haploid pollen grains on diploid stigmata was found to be 1625±127, that of diploid pollen on tetraploid stigmata 2863±98. © 1976 H.

The enzyme seems to be introduced into the layer at the vacuolate stage when evaginations extend from the spore cytoplasm. The stigma in Thalassia is papillate and the papillae are covered by a pellicle in which esterase activity has been detected. The implications of exterase in the pollen wall and stigma surface in post-pollination behaviour in Thalassia are discussed with reference to terrestrial species.

The behaviour of the marked telocentric chromosomes was scored in the 14 distinct hybrids obtained from these pollinations. In 6 of the hybrids in which different A genome chromosomes were marked by telocentrics there were from 50 to 80% of the pollen mother cells in which the telocentrics were paired. In the seven hybrids in which different B genome chromosomes were marked the telocentrics were never paired. It was concluded that the genome of T. urartu matched very closely the A genome of hexaploid wheat and that it did not correspond, as had been proposed by Johnson, to the B genome. The pairing behaviour of the 14 T. aestivum × T. urartu hybrids was compared with earlier results obtained from hybrids between T. aestivum and T. boeoticum. It was proposed that the higher trivalent frequencies seen in the T. boeoticum hybrids could be due to homoeologous pairing and that the genotype of T. boeoticum has the capacity partly to suppress the activity of the Ph locus of chromosome 5B of wheat, as a result of which homoeologous pairing is normally prevented. © 1976, Cambridge University Press.

The method which was used intercepts the pollen flux of the atmosphere with a vertical filtering unit, which is exposed facing the direction of wind on the filtering door of the weather?vane and collects much larger quantities of pollen than the other techniques of collection. The atmospheric currents displace from one region to another numerous spores and pollens, the trajectories of which are directly influenced by the general circulation of the atmosphere. The density of these fluxes can be very large, reaching 2500 grains/m3 of air at M.T.P.R. in the last week of January; the taxons collected are very numerous (more than 700). The atmospheric transfer of pollen modifies largely the pollen content of the atmosphere of different flowering domains. These interferences manifest themselves in the simplest cases by the presence of two peaks of concentration, the principal corresponding to the local efflorescence, the second to the pollen transferred from other regions. The pollen concentrations in the mountains are one?third of those in the plains. Pollination in the mountains is several weeks late in comparison to the plain during the first semester, whereas during the second semester, it is the plains that show a certain delay. These findings show why some allergic patients who go to the mountains during summer are affected twice by pollination. Copyright © 1976, Wiley Blackwell.

It is suggested that two of the main types may be pollinated mainly by birds, one by sphingid moths and one by butterflies. Above 3000 m red?flowered species greatly predominate over those with other colours in Papuasia, and also through much of Malesia; the relationship between ornithophily and this correlation is discussed. The distribution of flower types within supraspecific taxa suggests that some rearrangement of the latter may be necessary; some flower types are demonstrably polyphyletic. It is shown that in west Malesia species with flower colour other than red, not or slightly zygomorphic flowers and relatively longer corolla lobes are commoner than within Papuasia; it appears that section Viveya is, florally at least, most specialized in this latter area. Flower type and pollinators in section Vireya are related to those in the rest of the genus, and it is suggested that the adoption of ornithophily has been an important factor in the success of the Ericaceae as a whole in tropical montane areas.

Early embryo development was slower following low dosages of irradiation than at higher dosages and there was no significant improvement in haploid production. At higher dosages, the frequencies of seed set, embryos and haploid seedlings declined.

After pollination by 4x sugar beets this 4x F1 B1 produced. besides predominatly apomictically multiplied 4x plants, also about 7% haploid 2x hybrids. The latter probably possess 1 genome from B. vulgaris and 1 genome from B. lomatogona. In the meiosis of the PMC's a certain amount of homeology between a number of chromosomes of both species could be established. The amphihaploid hybrids can be used as breeding parents for the creation of types in which introgession can occur. During hybridization in addition to 2x and 4x B. vulgaris types a number of 2x-, 3x-, 5x- and 6x-hybrids arose. This is presumably caused by the presence of gametes with the somatic number of chromosomes and the occurrence sometimes of haploid apomictic multiplication. The presence of large numbers of bolters in the F1 and F1 B1 suggests that the bolting tendency of both species is based on different genes. © 1976 H.

In the first model, it is supposed that self-pollination is complete, heterozygotes are absent, and only seeds disperse. Then the ploidy is arbitrary. In the second, it is assumed that the plants are diploid, cross-pollination is total, and only pollen disperse. Explicit conditions for a protected polymorphism are derived for each model in the diallelic two-niche case. These conditions are simplified, displayed graphically, and discussed extensively for directional selection for different alleles in the two niches. If the amount of seed dispersal is divided by two, the criteria for a protected polymorphism in the self-pollinating scheme become identical to the criteria in the cross-pollinating situation with no multiplicative dominance. The restrictions that must be placed on the fitnesses for a protected polymorphism always become more stringent as the amount of dispersion increases. If the dispersion rate is not very close to zero and the selection coefficients are very small, the protection conditions reduce to overdominance for the mean fitnesses in the habitat. Unless there is complete dominance, protection always exists with fixed fitnesses for sufficiently low non-zero dispersal. For any amount of dispersion, there is always protection in the second model if, in each niche, the fitness of the deleterious homozygote is less than that of the heterozygote. © 1976 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

The sparse literature on the plant is summarised before referring to the results of a study of S. diclinis in the wild. A new description of the species is presented and its taxonomic affinities discussed. Details of the flowering time of S. diclinis, possible pollinators and its population age structure are set out and its wild habitat described. Before examining the possible origin of the distribution of S. diclinis, an attempt is made to clarify the various classifications of endemism that have been widely used in the literature. It is considered that since these classifications are generally based on the supposed origins of endemics they do not form a sound basis for the examination of evidence in individual cases. Types of evidence that can be used to throw light on the history of individual endemics are examined and include evidence gained from experimental taxonomy, pollen and macrofossil analysis and ecological studies. Unfortunately, in the case of S. diclinis there is no direct evidence referring to its past. One hypothesis, based on present distribution and on a consideration of Mediterranean Cenozoic palaeo-environments, is put forward to explain the present restriction of S. diclinis. Finally, the genetic situation in a restricted endemic population, the future of S. diclinis and conservation measures are discussed. © 1976.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-31544440874

Following is an account of qualitative histochemical investigation on the constitution of the septal nectaries in D. montanum and A. cepa from the time of their inception till their disorganization with an aim to correlate the cytochemical changes with their functioning and to understand the significance of their presence in the flower. © 1976, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Chinese Spring with the above three cytoplasms. And, the seed fertilities of these lines were investigated. Seven ditelosomic lines with the squarrosa cytoplasm had high fertilities. However, ditelo-2D? and -7DS with the crassa cytoplasm showed highly reduced fertilities. Their fertility reduction was mainly due to pistillody. We produced 18 monosomics of the D genome chromosomes with the three alien cytoplasms, except mono-5D with the squarrosa cytoplasm and mono-2D and -5D with the crassa cytoplasm. Every monosomic line had high seed fertility, although several lines showed slight reduction when compared with the corresponding normal monosomic lines. By backcrossing the three cytoplasm substitution lines with nullitetrasomics, we attempted to obtain the nullitetrasomics with the alien cytoplasm. As a result, twelve lines, which were all fertile, were obtained. However, chromosomal segregations were biased particularly in the crosses between mono-1D tri-1A plants with the three alien cytoplasms (?) and the normal nulli-1D tetra-1A's (?), and none of nulli-1D tri-1A's and nulli-1D tetra-1A's was obtained. Furthermore, mono-1D tri-1A's with these cytoplasms showed extreme reduction of seed fertility when pollinated by nulli-1D, while normal seed fertility by the disomic. Ditelo-1DL plants with those alien cytoplasms were normally fertile. Taking all these results in consideration, we concluded that the viability gene(s) against the three alien cytoplasms is located on the long arm of the 1D chromosome of common wheat. © 1976, The Genetics Society of Japan.

The experiment employed a simple lattice design with four replications. Each family contained 64 seedlings for a total 2, 304. The test plantation was exposed for two winter seasons from 1972 to 1974. Until early summer in 1974 the cold injury was observed on 58% of the entire tested plant. The susceptibility differences in cold injury among families were significant and highly significant, respectively, in two analyses based on number of injured plants and mean length of dead shoots. A narrow-sense heritability for the susceptibility was 0. 602. The value suggests that resistant families can be successfully picked from candidate trees selected at the plantation in which the outbreak of cold injury occurred. In case of all families in bulk, the correlation coefficients between the degree of injury and morphological characters of each plant indicate that height growth rate may be a key factor in determining intensity of injury.

Likewise, reference to the most effective pollinator4 of a plant species is often based on estimates of the abundance of alternative pollinators. Demonstrations that various pollinators can cause seed set in caged plants5 and that pollinators transfer pollen in different amounts6,7 are difficult to relate to natural conditions.

Group Tuberosum, the common potato, according to two methods. Firstly, the aberrant types were selected, through chromosome counting, from parthenogenic dihaploid offspring of tetraploid-diploid crosses. In dihaploid populations from twelve tetraploid potato varieties the frequencies of aneuploids ranged from 3.5 to 11.0%. About 95% of these aneuploids had only one, and the others not more than two extra chromosomes. Secondly, the aneuploids were produced from triploid-diploid crosses. Seedset strongly depended on the crossability of the parental plant material, and the best results were obtained when the motherplants were grafted onto tomato. On avarage the three most successful cross combinations resulted in approximately 0.7 berries per pollination and 6 seeds per berry. With regard to seedsize the seed could be divided in two groups, viz, normal and small seeds. Half of the seed did not germinate or produced inviable seedlings, especially among the small seed group. About 93% of the plants was neuploid, with 25, 26 and 27 being the predominant chromosome number. It was concluded that the production of trisomics was the most successful through triploid-diploid crosses. The results were discussed with reference to the chromosomal behaviour in the meiosis in triploid plants (Lange & Wagenvoort, 1973a). It thus was possible to relate the low seedset to the distribution of chromosomes in the meiotic anaphases. On the one side this distribution resulted in a limitation of the avalability of gametes with monohaploid and near-monohaploid chromosome numbers, while on the other side the macrospores with higher chromosome numbers seemed to be inviable. Finally a crossing scheme was presented for transmitting the trisomic condition into a genetic background with better homogeneity and more homozygosity. © 1975 H.

Isolated, male-sterile tetraploid LpFa3 hybrids from the cross diploid Lolium perenne x hexaploid Festuca arundinacea, were open-pollinated by octoploid L2Fa6's. The percentage successful doubling (percentage of flowering tetraploid plants, which gave seedlings) x (percentage of these seedlings with the doubled number of chromosomes) was for 157 clones, in 1972, 45%; for 407 clones in 1974 it was considerably smaller, i.e. 7%. Data of our own experiments and experiments from the literature with meiotic and mitotic doubling of the chromosome number of LFa3 hybrids were compared. The percentage of successful meiotic doubling for three experiments was, on average, 38%. For germinated seeds and tillers mitotic doubling by colchicine treatment yielded, on average, 11% (three experiments) and 3% (four experiments), respectively. In addition to the fact that meiotic doubling, on average, gives better results than mitotic doubling, there are the advantage of an absence of mixoploid plants and the advantage of a perhaps greater heterozygosity. It is likely that application of meiotic doubling facilitates the production of fertile Festulolium hybrids and of other intergeneric or interspecific fertile hybrids in which meiotic doubling is possible. © 1975 H.

The perianth, differentiated into a sepal and petal cycle, has a tubular, but free arrangement basally around a slightly stipitate ovary. The two cycles of stamens with dimorphic filaments are positioned by the differently lobed auricles of the mature sepals and petals. These auricles also form a trap-lid mechanism for the inverted nectary which also has passageways. The perianth parts are highly UV absorbant due to the presence of flavonoids. This pattern contrasts strikingly with the purple trident basal guide lines so prominent in the visible spectrum. The weakly protandrous flowers also have exserted styles, thus functioning to exclude its own pollen and insure outbreeding.

This material may also be seen in the cytoplasm, contained in membrane-bound vesicles. It is not clear how the content of the vesicles is discharged, but it appears not to involve the participation of microtubules. The source of the cytoplasmic fibrillar bodies depends upon the stage of development of the pollen tube. The earilest growth is derived from the inclusion into the wall of vesicles containing pre-formed materials present in the grain on pollination. During the next stage of growth the wall is derived from the content of double-membraned inclusions also present in the pollen. The content of the former vesicles is not so similar to the wall as the latter, but intermediates between the 2 types of vesicle may be seen in the cytoplasm, indicating that the former are formed from the latter. Most of the tube wall is derived from the products of dictyosomes in the pollen grain or tube. These dicytosomes are few in number and they must be exceedingly active. This, and the observation that dictyosome vesicles are frequently associated with banked complexes of mitochondria, indicates that some steps in the metabolism of the vesicular content, perhaps phosphorylation, take place distant from the dicytosomes. These different sources of fibrillar material presumably permit the rapid starting of tube growth, without any attendant metabolism. However, it would be impossible to include enough pre-formed wall material in the grain to enable the full growth of the tube, so once started, it seems that the tube then relies on the elaboration of simple reserves for the contruction of its wall. These reserves are likely to be held in the pollen, and may be the large numbers of starch grains characteristic of the pollen cytoplasm.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016537437

The different types of polymorphisms observed varied from total absorption by the whole flower to limited absorption by selected floral parts, such as corolla bases (nectar guides) or anthers. Some visible spectrum polymorphisms, e.g. in Anemone and Hepatica, were not associated with different ultraviolet patterns. In three species of Iris, a distinct ultraviolet absorbing landing spot and nectar, tunnel guide as well as reflecting anthers are reported.

It was concluded that faillure of some ovules to develop following Pisum sativum x Vicia faba cross pollination was the result of slow germination of pollen and slow growth of the Vicia pollen tubes, with subsequent lack of fertilization.

Genetic relationship is measured by the coefficient of inbreeding of a seed produced by a mother plant located at a specified place, or by the coefficient of kinship between two seeds, produced from the same mother plant or produced from two different mother plants separated by a certain distance. The influence of the single parameters on these coefficients is demonstrated by some typical examples, which show that dimensionality of the habitat (one- or two-dimensional), as well as, range and type of pollen dispersal, has little influence on the relationship between seed produced from the same mother plant and, on the other hand, emphasize the important role of the rate of self-fertilization and population density.

Box 8, Tafo, Ghana","From field observations and laboratory rearings, the biology of Forcipomyia squamipennis I. & M. in cocoa plantations in Ghana was established as follows. Adult midges are found between buttresses of large shade trees, in crevices of decayed old logs, in hollow tree stumps and cocoa husk heaps. Swarming takes place at any time during the day in or around the resting place, while dispersal occurs in the early morning and in the late afternoon, the normal flight range being 56 m. The largest populations occur in the rainy season. Eggs are laid on moist decomposing wood, cocoa husks and other plant debris in batches of 4090; the larvae hatch in 23 days and pupate after four moults, when about 12 days old; the pupal stage lasts 23 days. Adult females require liquid plant food for survival and oviposition, although the maturation of ova is independent of adult food intake or mating; unfertilised eggs do not develop. The maximum adult life span for both sexes is eight days in captivity. F. squamipennis undergoes at least 12 generations a year. Due to its abundance and continuous breeding in cocoa plantations, F. squamipennis is probably the most important Ceratopogonid cocoa pollinator in Ghana. Both sexes are efficient pollinators, but four times more males than females visit cocoa flowers. © 1975, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922365595

After pollination, sea water impairs pollen germination only briefly, whereas distilled water adversely affects pollen tube production. The tolerance of pollen to sea water is associated with the relative humidity of the air in a way not fully understood. Bumblebee behaviour in an area of saltmarsh, dune and shingle appears to be affected by the bending of inflorescence stalks and consequent deposition of bees on wet ground. The bees behaviour results in restriction of gene flow between adjacent populations in different habitats. Copyright © 1975, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981575526

Roughly, constancy is the tendency of the pollinator to continue searching for a flower of the species last visited. The model involves and abundant plant species A and two uncommon plant species, B and C, where the pollinator does not distinguish between B and C. The effect on the frequency of pollinator visits to species B when C has newly invaded the colony is determined. It is shown that, under the right conditions, constancy and competition for pollinator services can result in an explosion in the number of specimens of B present in future generations. Conversely, if C becomes extinct constancy and competition for pollinator services can result in the extinction of species B. © 1975, Springer-Verlag.

An analytical model is developed to examine relationships between species diversities of the two groups. Using this model, we show that equilibrium numbers of plant and pollinator species may be established. This equilibrium is primarily dependent upon the sizes of plant and pollinator species pools, rates of encounter and extinction, and the enhancement of survivorship due to plant-pollinator interactions.

Most honeybees visited male flowers from which they usually collected pollen as well as nectar. The proportion of honeybees collecting pollen loads did not vary much with the time of day. Few of the honeybees visiting female flowers had pollen loads, and, although they had less pollen on their bodies than honeybees visiting male flowers, they had more than wasps and so were more likely to pollinate the flowers. © 1975.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003226385

Derivations have been performed for two different cases: A) Parental genetic structure explicitly given: inferences for the expected genetic structure of the resulting seed population; B) Extension of case A) to several non-overlapping generations. If random cross-fertilization is assumed for case A) the genetic composition does not change and the genetic distance between the corresponding Hardy-Weinberg-structure and the expected offspring-structure is 0 if the rate of self-fertilization is equal to 1/N (N = population-size); any deviation from 1/N causes an increase in genetic distance. in case B) the expected genetic structures have been derived for all generations and it was possible to establish a comparatively simple dependence on the coefficient of inbreeding. In addition the variance of the allele-frequency has been presented. All the above influential components can be summarized by a single quantity, called M. After proving that 1/M can be conceived as the effective population-size, all the results obtained could be presented depending on this effective size and the average rate of self-fertilization only. Applying the findings of the model to the situation realized approximately in a seed-orchard, the following statements can be made: Case A) Again assuming random cross-fertilization, a deviation of the parental population from the corresponding Hardy-Weinberg-proportions can, with increasing rate of self-fertilization, be exceeded by the respective deviation of the seed population. Case B) The influence of pollen dispersal on the effective population size has been investigated, assuming no variation of the individual rates of self-fertilization, pollen and seed production within the population. Only extremely small differences between effective and actual population size were obtained, which indicates that the influence of pollen dispersal is of minor importance in this case. For different rates of self-fertilization, significant differences in the increments per generation for the coefficients of inbreeding, as well as the frequency of homozygotes, were obtained for the first generation only. Decreasing number of clones influences the rate of self-fertilization and the effective population size simultaneously by increasing the first and decreasing the latter. This is transferred to the coefficient of inbreeding, frequency of the homozygotes and the variance of the allele frequency by an increase of increments for all generations. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20044389844

Among the other methods, no one method seemed to be invariably the best, the utility of each scoring method being dependent on the aim and conditions of the particular experiment. Scoring methods regarded as least subject to error for some typical experimental conditions were presented. The necessity of recording the numbers and sizes of M2-lines and the segregation ratios of the mutants regardless of the scoring method adopted in individual cases was made. These records should be useful not only for the transformation or standardization of mutation scores for our future needs, but also for refining our knowledge of the various factors causing distortions in the scores. It was also noted that the greatest care should be taken in all cases, so that each M2-line might be derived from equally- or closely-ranked tillers.

The pronounced effect of phosphorus level on percentage fruit set was also at least partially attributable to its effect on the rate of flower cluster emergence since delayed emergence reduced the opportunity for cross-pollination and fruit set. Fruit from phosphorus-deficient trees contained fewer but larger cells than fruit from non-deficient trees. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorus level is an important regulator of the meristematic activity of apple tree tissue. Leaves and fruit on phosphorus-deficient trees showed comparatively early senescence. It is suggested that retarded bud development on deficient trees in spring and early senescence of deficient tissues in autumn could result from reduced cytokinin production by deficient trees. Leaf analysis was superior to fruit analysis as an index of the phosphorus status of apple trees. Fruit phosphorus values tended to be constant with time for a given treatment, but leaf phosphorus values declined with time and progressively more of the trees in the low phosphorus treatments developed visual symptoms of phosphorus deficiency. Analysis of soil each year proved of little value as a predictor of the phosphorus status of the trees, since deficiency symptoms were seen on trees grown in soil containing over 1000 ppm phosphorus. Magnesium deficiency symptoms developed on trees in the high phosphorus treatments, and the possible reason for this is briefly discussed. © 1975, CSIRO.

The relationship of yield to density was studied by fitting mathematical functions to the observed yields. Only two functions, (1) the inverse quadratic on yield per unit area, and (2) the linear regression between density and the logarithm of grain yield per plant, were satisfactory fits. The linear regression was preferred because of its ease of calculation and interpretation. Between genotypes the largest differences in grain yield per unit area were found at densities either above or below those which are employed in normal practice. The ranking of the genotypes for grain production depended upon the density. Whereas at the lowest density a very short, early-maturing flint genotype, Gaspé Flint, yielded least, and a tall, full season dent hybrid, 0X324, yielded most, this position was reversed at the higher densities. Maximal levels of yields of the open-pollinated flint varieties were low, and it is apparent that the incorporation of this source of germplasm in hybrids is limited if commercially acceptable yields are to be attained. Maximal yields of 600 g/m2 were produced by three hybrids, but the optimal densities were markedly divergent. They ranged from 62 plants/m2 for 0X324 to 97 and 108 plants/m2 for INRA 270 and INRA 200. Possible reasons for such differences are discussed in terms of the interactions of density and genotype on the components of yield. © 1975, Cambridge University Press.

The origin of the seeds is attributed to the sporadic failure of function of one division during meiosis. As a result of atypical meiosis in haploids, deviations in chromosome number and structure have been reported in the offspring of haploids of other species.

The probable attributes of a common ancestor are indicated and it is concluded that the family has no close relatives, although it possibly diverged early from the Rosiflorean line. Chromosomal evolution has been complex, with early polyploidy, repeated dysploid reductions and great change in chromosome size, from a probable base of x = 7. Habit, wood anatomy, leaf form and sequence, chemical features, inflorescences, pollination and pericarp anatomy are discussed in relation to adaptation, phylogeny, parallelism and convergence. Distribution is analysed ecogeographically and in relation to the fossil record and chronology of continental movement. Ancestors of major groups may have differentiated before the break?up of Gondwanaland.

Australia, which had no indigenous populations, has been colonized by four morpho-physiological variants. The four introductions have maintained their successful adaptations through self-pollination but have produced new morpho-physiological combinations in certain floodplain habitats through hybridization of sympatric variants. The four introductions can be treated variously as members of morphological complexes: chinense, italicum, pennsylvanicum, and cavanillesii, or as members of four taxa: X. chinense Mill., X. italicum Mor., X. californicum Greene, and X. cavanillesii Schouw. The introduction of X. chinense represents a type that is photoperiodically adapted to the south-eastern United States and is similar to populations occurring on the Mississippi Delta south of New Orleans, Louisiana. This introduction in the chinense complex reportedly arrived in Queensland with American cotton seed and is commonly referred to as Noogoora burr. It represents the most aggressive form of Xanthium and is widely distributed in eastern Australia from northern Victoria to Queensland and the Northern Territory. The populations of X. italicum represent a morphological form that is currently found in populations of eastern Texas, where the italicum and chinense complexes are sympatric, and was possibly introduced in its present intermediate morpho-physiological state. This introduction in the italicum complex is photoperiodically similar to plants of central Texas and is confined to latitudes 29-33° in New South Wales. Hybrid intermediates between the populations of X. chinense and X. italicum have been detected in river floodplains of New South Wales where the two introductions are sympatric. The introduction in the pennsylvanicum complex can be referred to X. californicum Greene. It represents a morpho-physiological form that occurs in northern California and may have originated in the vicinity of the San Francisco Bay. Reportedly confined in Australia to the eastern portion of South Australia and adjacent Victoria, this introduction seems to be adapted to a Mediterranean climate. Collections of Australia and California cultivated in central Texas showed poor vigour, stem rotting, and drying branches with no burr production. The introduction of X. cavanillesii is locally confined to the Nepean-Hawkesbury drainage north-west of Sydney and is not reported outside New South Wales. These populations of the cavanillesii complex represent the morphological form that is indigenous to South America and may have originated in the vicinity of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Although the origins of Xanthium in Australia are not documented, they were probably accidentally introduced with cotton seed (X. chinense), in animal fur (X. italicum, X. cavanillesii) and with grape stock (X. Californicum). The morpho-physiological range of the four introductions represents a very small part of the total adaptive range within the eight complexes of X. strumarium and could be expanded by subsequent arrivals from other continents. © 1975 CSIRO.

Typha latifolia pollen has been demonstrated to be effectively dispersed only by strong winds. Under normal conditions the pollen remains viable for at least 4 weeks, but it is sensitive to high humidity and high and low temperatures. In spite of this, a very high degree of self-pollination is found. Most of the pollen falls from the male inflorescence directly of to the female. More seeds are set at the top of the female part of the inflorescence than at the bottom. Typha angustifolia L. shows a higher cross- or neighbourpollination rate than T. latifolia. This has been demonstrated to be due to the lighter pollen and higher positioned male inflorescence in T. angustifolia. The success quota between pollination (adhering pollen grains) and fertilization (seed set) is about 63% in T. angustifolia and 54% in T. latifolia. The pistillodia (club-shaped, modified flowers) are evenly distributed throughout the female inflorescence; in humid conditions the club-shaped tip swells and thus protects the ripe seeds from water. The inflorescence bursts and liberates the fruits in dry conditions probably due to a combination of the shrinking of the pistillodia heads and a hygroscopically controlled spreading of the perianth hairs. The fruit is effectively wind distributed. When the fruit lands on water the perianth hairs with the water. The pericarp wall is also hygroscopically controlled and opens quickly when this contact takes place. The seed is liberated into the water and sinks. © 1975.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001917512

This method is considered promising even for the detection of single-locus mutants when difficulty in discrimination of the objective mutants is large, and/or when permissible population size per generation is small, probably below 10,000, as a rough estimate.

While the former is a facultative calcicole, the latter is an obligate calcifuge. The present paper gives an account of plant performance and cytological behaviour of colchicine induced tetraploids that were produced by treating the inbred lines of these plants with 0.3% colchicine for 12 hours. Majority of the surviving plants were tetraploids exhibiting a slower growth delayed phenological events, deep green thick green rough foliage, increased dry matter production, enlarged epidermal and mesophyll cells, chloroplast, stomatal apparatus and frequency, pollen grains and a reduced seed viability than that of the diploids. While repent ecotype tetraploids had increased flower number per plant than that of the diploids, reverse was observed in the erect ecotype tetraploids. At metaphase I, uni, bi, tri, tetra and hexavalents in a varying frequency were observed in the colchiploids and the total number of multivalent associations and univalents per PMC on an average was equal in the tetraploids of each ecotype. This indicates a competition for pairing between homologous chromosomes which is supported by the fact that a significant positive correlation between chiasma frequency and multivalent formation was also observed. However, the colchiploids of the erect ecotype possessed greater number of multivalents and univalents than those of the repent ecotype colchiploids. Further stages of meiosis in the colchiploids were abnormal and resembled the typical autoploid meiois. Multiple spindles, complement fractionation and secondary association were also observed. The contribution of univalents and multivalents in inducing pollen sterility in the tetraploid material is significant. Attempts to cross these colchiploids with diploids produced non-viable abortive seeds. Artificial crossings amongst these colchiploids resulted in an early degeneration of the ovary and a failure of the seed formation. Natural self pollination yielded 5-9% of seeds that died after an extrusion of radicle when germinated. The study indicated that the two edaphic ecological races (ecotypes) exhibit a differential susceptibility to colchicine in relation to frequency of induced polyploids, morphological and reproductive features, number and frequrncy of chromosomal associations and univalents, pollen and seed fertility. However, a general agreement in having a morphological gigas, slowed growth rate, delayed phenological events and reduced reproductive capacity occurs in the tetraploids in comparison to the diploid progenitors, of both the ecotypes. A tendency to change the plant form (repent erect), which is governed by a single gene, was not observed, indicating thereby that the gene remains uneffected by the drug, in both the ecological races of M. dianthera. © 1975, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Heterosis is a phenomenon through which the yields of crop plants can be improved and explains the way this mechanism can be exploited more effectively and profitably. Heterosis in plants has usually been identified with hybrid vigor as a major component. Hybrid vigor is defined as the heterosis manifest, and is thus the phenotypic expression of heterosis, which is a genetic phenomenon. Heterosis can be obtained in plants, animals, and microorganisms for various economically important characters. In plants, the phenomenon is common both in cross as well as in self-pollinated crops. The crops in which heterosis has been commercially exploited or will be exploited in the near future are listed. The chapter discusses the heterosis in heterotrophs and autotrophs along with the various theories of heterosis: (1) dominance hypothesis, (2) overdominance hypothesis, (3) physiological stimulus and initial capital, (3) complementation at cellular and subcellular level, (4) balanced metabolism, and (5) hormonal and other factors. © 1975, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011961927

Through the process of hybridisation of different chemotypes of Withania somnifera (Solanaceae), changes have been observed among the substituents present in the steroidal lactones of the withanolide type which are characteristic for this and related species. Several reciprocal cross?pollinations were performed between the types and the structures of the withanolides produced in the leaves were analysed and determined. These studies led to an understanding of the biogenetic processes leading to specific substitution patterns, and in certain cases enabled a genetic control over the compounds produced in the plant. Compounds not present in natural types could be anticipated to be formed, and indeed were present in the hybrids. Through these studies an insight on the reactions governed by the genetic background of the types taking part in the hybridisation was achieved. Groupings, when found in specific locations of the skeleton could be described as present there due to dominant or recessive genetic characters. These conclusions were reached following analysis of a large number of offsprings for several generations. This method enabled the study of the genetic characters of a plant on the chemical level.

The same lines were crossed with European multigerm diploids to give anisoploid varieties, and also used as pollinators of American male-sterile diploids to yield monogerm and multigerm triploid varieties. Bigerm triploids were obtained from male-sterile hybrids heterozygous for the monogerm character, using European multigerm O-types in the grandparental generation. Doublecross monogerm triploids were obtained by crossing male-sterile diploids with non-equivalent O-types to provide male-sterile hybrids, and pollinating these with outbred tetraploids. Results from 35 root-yield trials showed that the sugar yields of the anisoploids and triploids were similar to those of contemporary commercial varieties, but that outbred tetraploids were slightly, and inbred tetraploids considerably, less productive. Changes induced in characters other than root weight by chromosome-doubling of diploid material were sometimes important, but not consistent in magnitude or direction. It is suggested that these changes result from selection and random drift rather than the ploidy change. A seed-yield trial demonstrated advantages of using hybrid seed-parents for triploid seed production. Problems of seed quality are discussed with particular reference to triploid varieties. It is concluded that the main importance of multigerm anisoploid varieties was in their combination of good sugar yield with near-monogerm fruit clusters at a time when commercial monogerm varieties were deficient in yield; the chief value of triploidy lay in its application to the short-term improvement of genetic monogerm varieties. The development of monogerm anisoploids is considered unlikely; but some advantages of deriving monogerm triploid varieties from tetraploid seed-parents are indicated, and it is suggested that these may become increasingly important in the future. © 1975, Cambridge University Press.

The flowering period is about 3 months but the extreme range is from late February to early July at elevations of 600-750 m. Flowers remain open for 1-2 weeks. Older trees tend to flower later than younger trees on the same site. Pollination isprobably effected chiefly by insects and birds. Flowering abundance follows a 2-year cycle with a tendency for heavier production every fourth year, but this pattern may be interrupted by severe insect attack on young shoots. Considerable losses occur at all stages of development owing to abscission, and to damage by gall and other insects. Quantitative estimates of flowering from litter trays indicate that the flower production of good years may be 25-65 times as great as in poor years. The mature forest produced 2.15-15.5 times as many flowers as the pole stage trees, and 1.5-10 times as many as the spar stage forest. Estimates of the fruit set following the late autumn flowering of 1954 indicate that that of the mature forest was 1.6 times as great as that in the spar stage forest and 3.5 times as great as that in the pole stage forest. The corresponding relative flower abundance in these forests was 1.5 and 3.8 respectively. However, the percentage of Rowers setting fruit from the early autumn flowering of 1956 was very much lower. Most capsules abscind or dehisce or fall attached to twigs within 3 years of their maturity. The quantitative estimate of flowering and fruit set permits seed crops from heavy flowering to be forecast a few years ahead of seed fall. © 1975 CSIRO.

Annual spray operations in the 2 to 4 oz active ingredient/acre range have involved millions of acres of forest. The aerial application techniques used in these spray programs are not amenable to fine control, and result in some areas being contaminated at levels which are physiologically although not necessarily lethally significant. Fauna which frequent highly exposed areas of the forest are particularly vulnerable. The authors found evidence that some birds which inhabit the crown canopy of the forest are affected when fenitrothion is applied at the present operational rates. Ground inhabiting birds and other organisms are generally much less likely to be subjected to physiologically significant dosages of the pesticide. While some pollinators and predatory insects are reduced as a consequence of these spray programs, the published studies on insect population dynamics are not sufficiently developed not documented to allow an authoritative assessment of trends. Thus, there is a need for a further assessment of fenitrothion's long term impact on desirable insects. While the direct immediate effects of fenitrothion on aquatic vertebrates appear to be minimal in the 2 to 4 ox/acre range, the data base is inadequate for the assessment of the long term consequences of kills of aquatic insects on fish which feed upon them. The available studies appear generally to permit only an estimate of the immediate overt risks associated with the application of fenitrothion. Since many of the studies which have thus far been made were found to be either inadequately documented or too poorly planned to yield environmentally relevant information, an attempt was made to assess the requirements for a firmer data base, and the recommendations resulting from this assessment are summarized.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016820570

The student attitude has been overwhelmingly positive. In addition, we have encouraging data, both on the performance of the students and their attitudes towards each of the units.The laboratory in Biology 1 has not been completely converted to audiotutorial, or to any other single medium or approach. We have performed the analysis in terms of the functions of the laboratory, and we have chosen the medium and format to fulfill each specific function. Laboratories that operate on this open format offer several immediate advantages: The students may work at their own pace (within certain limits), taking the time they need to reach the objectives of each unit. Because not all students do the same thing at the same time, the laboratory needs fewer of any one type of equipment. For example, only one audiotutorial unit on etherizing Drosophila is set up on a back laboratory bench in each of the four rooms. This proved enough for 600 students, since students could go through the unit at any time during the first three weeks of class. Many of the activities can be carried out away from the laboratoryeither at home, in the field, or utilizing a local resource (museum, aquarium, botanical garden, wildlife preserve, and so on). Each unit has specific objectives that we can test independently. This allows us to make more comprehensive evaluations of the materials in addition to informing the students of precisely what to expect. Because we rely on self-instructional materials, implementation of the entire laboratory model can come in stages. We have not yet converted the entire course to our model. This is partly because of the time and effort needed to create and test the individual units, and partly because we have a rotating faculty in this teamtaught course which makes uniform change in the entire course difficult. We have demonstrated that our model for laboratory instruction is feasible with large numbers of students and is effective both in terms of student performance and student attitude. We have prepared either written programmed instruction or audiotutorial units on plant growth, genetics, cell permeability, pollination, enzymes, and use of the microscope, spectrophotometer, and hemocytometer. We are eager to have these units used and evaluated on additional campuses.

All results are commensurate with the hypothesis that in most environments there is selective pressure towards specialization. However, it is only in the most predictable or stable environments that the resultant diminishment of behavioral and genetic flexibility is in a sense permitted by subsequent natural selection. In the most extreme environments, behavioral specialization may be a necessary prerequiste permitting briefly thriving ephemeral populations which must recolonize frequently. The data results indicate: 1) Total species number increases with stability and predictability of the climate; 2) As the climate ameliorates, niche-specialization is a progressively more successful strategy; 3) The percentage of niche-specialized species of both plants and flower-feeding herbivores increases in the most severe environments at the expense of the more moderately specialized species; 4) Energetic flow chart redundancy increases in extreme environments; 5) Especially important to an understanding of pollination interactions is the fact that similar physiognomic communities at very different altitudes are in all cases much more similar than different community types within a research site. © 1975, Springer-Verlag.

Heterosis was, on average, highest for seed yield (33%), followed by number of capsules per plant (16%). Mean percent heterosis was small for earliness, plant height and number of primary branches, while it was insignificant for number of secondary branches and percentage of oil. Significant negative heterosis was observed for percentage of protein. Percent heterosis was generally higher in Indian x exotic crosses than in Indian x Indian and exotic x exotic crosses. The exotic lines appeared to be useful in Indian sesame breeding programmes, particularly in the improvement of earliness, number of secondary branches, seed yield and protein content. Additive as well as non-additive gene action seemed to govern the expression of the various characters studied. General combining ability variances were predominant for days to flowering, plant height, number of primary branches and number of secondary branches, while specific combining ability variances were in moderate to high proportions for seed yield, percentage of oil and percentage of protein. T.M.V.-2 and S. I. 770 were the best general combiners for many of the characters while S. I. 1783 and Sel-R were found to be the best for earliness and oil content respectively. Significant variances due to reciprocal effects were also detected for some of the characters.

Male-steriles in both models may be maintained by overdominance at the sex-control locus or by having greater ovule or seed fertility than hermaphrodites. For both models fitness of male-steriles is frequency dependent under random mating or under mixed selfing and random mating, and for the case when male-steriles are maintained only by increased fertility, expressions are derived for their equilibrium proportions and those of both hermaphrodite genotypes.

The quadrivalent sometimes dissociated into two bivalents at MI, thus increased the number of bivalents, eventually increasing the total number of trivalents plus bivalent (6III + 2II, 4III4-4II, 3lii-)-5li, 2m-t-6ii) more than 7, which is generally found in autotriploids.Hypertriploids showed poor pollen fertility compared to diploid sibs. No seed was obtained after selfing of hypertriploid plants. Artificial pollination with pollen of diploid plants resulted in 7.72%, 6.96%, and 4.12% seed set for hypertriploid plants, No. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. One hypertriploid x diploid cross yielded nearly 81% aneuploid progeny. Of these, 56.3% were primary trisomics and 25% were 16-chromosome plants. Primary trisomics were for chromosome 1 (Bush), 3 (Pale), 4 (Robust), 5 (Psuedonormal), 6 (Purple), and 7 (Sem¡erect). © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343692152

Investigations of bumblebee population structure and dynamics prove that great titmice can periodically feed on Apoidea to a considerable degree. In 1972 and 1973, in each case during the spring, beside 70 solitary bees 130 Bombus? and Psithyrus??? picked apart by great titmice were collected in the Botanical Garden of Kiel.  The most endangered were the Bombus hypnorum and the Andrena fulva. The death rate attributable to this bird?feed has turned out to be dependent on the course of temperature and sunlight. This was evident not only over longer time periods, but also over the course of a day. Apoidea were especially jeopardized at temperatures ranging from 13°21° C. A sudden temperature rise after a prolonged period of inclement weather revealed itself as particularly unfavourable. During the spring Apoidea were consumed in two distinctly demarcated time periods, which is explained by the two separate broods of titmice. The great titmice captured bumblebees and other wild bees almost exclusively on blossoms. The preparation of their food happened in the following manner: detachment of the stinger (along with frequent severance of the distal segments), ingestion of the abdomen ? segmentation of the thorax and the removal of its contents. There are indications that the affixation of titmice nest?boxes can affect bee populations together with their pollination intensity, i.e. in fruit?growing areas. Bei Untersuchungen zur Populationsstruktur und Populationsdynamik der Hummeln stellte sich heraus, daß diese zeitweilig in größerem Ausmaß von Kohlmeisen gefressen werden können. Neben 70 solitären Apiden wurden 1972 und 1973 jeweils im Frühjahr 130 durch Kohlmeisen zerlegte Bombus? und Psithyrus??? im Botanischen Garten der Stadt Kiel eingesammelt. Am stärksten gefährdet waren Bombus hypnorum und Andrena fulva. Die auf Vogelfraß zurückzuführende Mortalitätsrate erwies sich als abhängig von Temperatur? und Sonnenscheinverlauf. Das zeigte sich sowohl über längere Zeiträume als auch im Tagesverlauf. Bei Temperaturen von 13°21° C waren Apiden besonders gefährdet. Als ausgesprochen ungünstig wirkte sich nach längerer Schlechtwetterperiode ein plötzlicher Temperaturanstieg aus. Die Apiden wurden im Frühjahr in zwei klar getrennten Zeiträumen gefressen. Dies wird auf zwei Meisenbruten zurückgeführt. Kohlmeisen erbeuteten Hummeln und andere Wildbienen fast ausschließlich auf Blüten. Die Nahrungsaufbereitung erfolgte in folgender Weise: Entstachelung (dabei häufig Abtrennen der letzten Segmente) und Ausfressen des Abdomens, Aufhacken des Thorax und Herausnahme des Inhalts.

The greatest amount of large pollen from the longest set of stamens is found on stigmas of long?styled flowers. Because of the inability to discriminate between small pollen grains from mid?level anthers and those from short?level anthers it is not clear how stigma position may influence the distribution of these small pollen grains. In the Moroccan population studied, plants with long?, mid?, and short?styled flowers are present in a 1:1:1 ratio. The chief pollinator during the period of study was the honey bee, Apis mellifera, which preferentially removes large pollen grains from flowers. Longs and Mids produce approximately equal numbers of pollen grains per flower, and Shorts produce c. 77% of the pollen of each of these two forms. Acetolysis of stigmas provides more accurate estimates of stigmatic pollen loads than does microscopic examination of intact stigmas, although the proportional representation of the two size classes of pollen is similar with either method. This study represents the first published analysis of pollen flow in a tristylous species within its native range and suggests that tristyly serves to promote compatible pollinations, thus supporting the classical interpretation of the biological significance of tristyly.

This much-studied genus of 108 species of trees, shrubs, and a few herbs, and of wide distribution in the warm parts of the World, has been divided for the first time consistently into 26 sections assigned to five subgenera. The flowers of all but one species (which are green) are red, scarlet, or orange and so constructed that outcrossing is universal; two species are reported to be genetically self-incompatible. There appear to be no barriers to interspecific hybridization except ecological/geographical ones, and all species are pollinated by birds, which are not known to discriminate between them. Hybrids are frequent in cultivation and where species come together in nature, and hybridization seems to have played a central role in the evolution of the genus. The nature and extent of polyploidy in the genus should be reexamined. Its reticulate pattern of evolution is reflected in its morphology, palynology, amino acids, and alkaloids. So much is now known about Erythrina that it is an ideal model group for evolutionary studies, including biosystematic ones and those involving predator-prey relationships, and an even more detailed knowledge of it should illuminate the kinds of evolutionary pattern found in many other less well studied groups of plants. The large collection of living plants being assembled at the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden in Kauai should provide an excellent basis for many such studies.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008384129

Colias, and apparently numerous other small, ectothermic, low-energy-demand pollinators, ""patronize"" plants producing relatively dilute nectars containing a high proportion of monosaccharide sugars and significant amounts of polar, nitrogen-rich amino acids. These plants also converge on a common ""target"" flower pattern in ultraviolet and human-visible light. High-energy demand, endothermic pollinators, by contrast, appear to require higher concentration nectars and/or higher proportions of di- and oligosaccharide sugars.

It is suggested to indicate seed set only as a percentage of the fertile analogue. Own investigations in Wageningen, the Netherlands, indicated that seed set on male sterile wheat plants on various distances from a pollen source of 6×6 m of a mixture of three spring wheat varieties amounted to maximally about 36%, but decreased quickly at increasing distances. Apart from an evident effect of the wind direction, in 1968 average seed set became less than 10 % after 1 m distance from the pollen source; in 1969 and under more favourable experimental conditions for the first meter from the pollen source a decrease to 25% took place, becoming 10% only after 3 m. It is recognized that for practical conclusions the pollen field size applied is too small. Both in 1971 and 1972 the seed set increased with increasing pollinator: male sterile ratio. This increase always was relatively small and, consequently, the kg yield hybrid seed per ha to be expected always decreased when this ratio increased. Applying a female strip width of 2 m and pollinator (mixture of five spring wheat varieties): male sterile ratios of 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1, in 1971 the latter ratio yielded only 60% of the former. In 1972 the same ratios were tested, but besides three male sterile strip widths were applied: 2, 3 and 4 m. In this year the calculated percentage seed set was much higher than that of the previous years (maximum almost 80%), probably as a consequence of more and larger pollinator areas and a more adequate way of establishing the 100% value of seed set. Again the kg yield hybrid seed per ha strongly decreased with an increase of the pollinator: male sterile ratio. The efficiency of the different ratios depends on the width of the female strip. Unfortunately, but according to the expectation, the kg yield hybrid seed per ha decreases, apart from the male to female ratio, fixing the 2 m value at 100%, to about 88% at 3 m and 72% at 4 m female strip width. © 1974 H.

Scab resistance in the field greatly varied with the weather conditions. In the greenhouse or under favourable conditions for scab infection in the field, only a few percent of the seedlings of progenies of the second back-cross were found resistant. The 'Antonovka' progenitors also transmitted mildew resistance, which increased when 'Lord Lambourne' was used as a partner, but no immune seedlings occurred in the nursery. With age susceptibility decreased to the extent that a fair proportion of the seedlings were found to be resistant in the field in later years. The degree of scab resistance noted in trees in the orchard was closely relatad to that observed in the greenhouse; orchard and nursery observations significantly correlated for both scab and mildew. There was also a strong correlation between scab infection of the fruits and that of the leaves. Fruit properties of Antonovka offspring of the third generation were on average about the same as those of cultivar progenies. It is pointed out that breeding on the basis of multigenic resistance in large-fruited 'Antonovka' selections may not be less efficient than breeding on the basis of monogenic resistance in small-fruited Malus species. © 1974 H.

In bridge-crosses between the fertile tetraploid progeny of a previous T. dicoccoides-T. durum cross and susceptible T. aestivum cultivars, the fertility was markedly improved (approximately 50% when T. aestivum served as pollinator); the F1 pentaploid hybrids of these three-way crosses segregated in a pattern fitting a 1 resistant:1 susceptible ratio. Results obtained by both of these methods thus prove that a single dominant gene for resistance to stripe rust was transferred from T. dicoccoides sel. G-25 to the susceptible T. aestivum cultivars.

For both characters significant differences were established. Taking 300 anthers per variety, the mean anther lengths varied from 2.99 to 3.84 mm. With the same anthers the mean number of pollen grains per anther ranged from 1746 to 2856. The correlation coefficients of both characters within varieties run from 0.431 to 0.752 and were invariably significant. Linear regression showed that the slopes of the regression lines of the various varieties differed significantly. Combination of a fast increase of the number of pollen grains per anther at increasing anther length and a large anther length should be useful. Between varieties the correlation coefficient of anther length and number of pollen grains per anther amounted to 0.895, significant at a P<0.05. The knowledge that genotypes with large anthers also produce many pollen grains per anther facilitates the selection for a high pollen production per anther.

A single application of 2.0 kg a. i. (active ingredient) of RH-531 per ha with a surfactant gave maximum reduction in fertility. Pollen stainability by acetocarmine was only slightly reduced by RH-531. To reduce fertility to 10% or less, treatment should be made just prior to or at the time of meiosis (jointing stage with flag leaf emerged). The two varieties studied differed greatly in their response to RH-531; however, most of the difference could be attributed to differences in growth stage at the time of treatment. Anza showed increased spike density and thickened floral tissues and was apparently more sensitive to RH-531 than Yecora 70. Even though sterility was induced, the floret response was not typical of a male-sterile wheat and was not favorable to outcrossing. More than 98% of the seeds produced by open-pollination on treated plants were the result of self-pollination as determined by progeny testing. Further experience with RH-531 is necessary to determine whether this compound affects the normal development of male and/or female gametes.

The U.V. absorptive banner petal and staminal portions of the flowers of both species seemed to be the most important visual orientation guides, and except for Trigona fuscipennis and T. pectoralis, the banner petal was the more important of the two. Emasculation of the flowers may have removed the orientation cue used by these species of Trigona, which may be orienting to the flowers solely on the basis of pollen odour. Morphological and physiological changes in the floral colour patterns of both species following pollination appear to inhibit visitation by bees.

The exine degradation is restricted to the colpal regions. Hydration of the pollen grain by buffer solution without contact with the stigma also stimulates the degradation of the exine. The erosion of the exine reveals a fibrous, PAS-positive matrix which follows the original contours of the exine.Vesicles are discharged into the intinc following pollination; these appear to contribute their contents to the intine-like wall which eventually invests the pollen tube.The observations are interpreted by assuming:. 1. an enzyme situated within the pollen and localized under the colpi; this enzyme is active after hydration;. 2. the degradation is a means by which colpal furrows are enlarged to permit the emergence of the pollen tube;. 3. the degradation process both by buffer and on the stigma is purely the consequence of hydration and is only secondarily related to incompatibility through the 'pin' by 'pin' pollination not permitting hydration of the pollen. © 1974 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942686816

Plants containing RBDV showed no obvious symptoms, but healthy or infected flowers pollinated with infected pollen produced crumbly fruit, containing a high proportion of aborted drupelets. RBDV was difficult to eliminate from infected raspberry by heat therapy. Raspberry cultivars that fail to become infected naturally were also immune to infection by grafting. Use of immune cultivars offers the only method of control and, because infected plants may produce crumbly fruit, future cultivars should if possible possess immunity to RBDV.

The frequencies of the female gametes in both 2n= 14+1 and 2n=14+2 rye plants have been estimated with reference to their chromatid constitution. From the results obtained on the offspring, it seems that preferential distribution takes place during female meiosis of 2n= 14+2 plants. It has been demonstrated that pollen carrying B chromosomes formed in plants of 2n=14+2 was more competitive than normal pollen. On the contrary, when it was formed from plants 2n=14+1, B chromosome elimination by pollen was total. This process may be considered as sporophytic determination. The genetic significance of the presence of B chromosomes in natural populations is discussed. It is proposed that B chromosomes may be the cytological expression of a complex evolutionary system which results in conservation of population genetic variability. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250410758

Treatment means showed that there was no significant difference between leaving the flower truss undisturbed and tripping, but all other treatments differed significantly (P = 001) from these two. There was no difference in number of seeds set per flower between self- or cross-pollination following emasculation. Tick inbred lines set more seeds per flower over all treatments than horse inbreds. Differences were seen between tick and horse inbreds when the flower truss was left undisturbed; some tick inbreds set seed, but no seed was set on the horse inbreds. An association between seed size and autofertility is suggested. Results from the horse inbreds were in agreement with previous pollination studies on inbred lines of winter beans.

The phenology of the fig during the male phase (D) was observed in detail and various techniques were devised in order to ensure the normal behaviour of the wasps in spite of the bisection of the fig and the strong illumination necessary for carrying out the observations. It was found that in fig?halves tightly enclosed with cellophane paper during the second morning of the male phase, the emerging wasps filled their pockets with pollen from anthers previously detached by the male wasps. It was established that the cutting of anthers is a separate, specific action and not merely a byproduct of the tunnelling of the syconial wall that takes place afterwards. In the filling act itself, the role of the combsrows of stiff bristles along the inner margin of each foreleg coax was established. Pollen was lifted by the arolia of the forelegs from the open anthers to the underside of the thorax and shovelled from there by the coxal combs into the thoracic pockets which gaped widely due to the bending of the body. An analysis of the responses of the wasps to various environmental conditions leads to the conclusion that the size of the cavity is a critical factor in the behaviour of the wasps in the fig of F. sycomorus. The possible role of light for pocket filling in the subdued illumination of the intact fig cavity is discussed. Copyright © 1974, Wiley Blackwell.

Twelve of these S alleles have previously been found in kale, and 7 are known only from Brussels sprouts. The number of S alleles per cultivar varied from 4 to 13, but for most cultivars the number fell in the range 7-10. Relatively unselected cultivars tend to have more S alleles than highly selected ones. In every cultivar the S allele frequencies are very unequal. The alleles with the greatest overall frequency are S2 and S5 and in almost all the cultivars tested one of these two alleles is the commonest. The rare S alleles not only occur at very low frequencies, but also occur in few cultivars. The commonest S alleles are recessive and the rare alleles are dominant. Dominant S alleles normally confer a higher degree of self-incompatibility than recessive S alleles. In Brussels sprouts cultivars a dynamic balance between outbreeding and inbreeding is achieved through the S allele system. The recessive S alleles, when present at high frequencies, allow some inbreeding, while the dominant S alleles promote outbreeding even when they are present at low frequencies. Because dominant S alleles confer high levels of self-incompatibility it is desirable to incorporate them into inbred lines used for the production of F1 hybrid cultivars of Brussels sprouts. Such dominant alleles do occur in Brussels sprouts, but are rare and at least 20, and preferably 50, plants of a cultivar should be tested if rare S alleles are being sought. © 1974 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966147627

From the standard deviation a potential size fraction is estimated, being the fraction of the buds occurring in a size grade of 10 mm width if the mean bud size were located at the mid-point of the grade. This estimate of bud size uniformity was independent of date of sampling for a period of at least 4 weeks. The potential size fraction was increased by stopping (apical bud removal) and in some cultivars an optimum stopping date was indicated. Increased plant density also increased the potential size fraction, particularly in unstopped crops. Between-plant variation in bud size was significantly greater for the hybrid Thor than the out-pollinating Seven Hills but within-plant variation was the more important component of overall bud size variation and was greatly reduced by stopping and by increased plant density in unstopped crops. Mean bud size at any harvest date was increased by early stopping and lower plant density. It is concluded that the date of stopping should be chosen to minimize bud size variation and the plant density varied to spread maturity. © 1974, Cambridge University Press.

Lipids increase during pollination and decrease later during pollen tube growth. The germinating pollen grains have high concentrations of polysaccharides, RNA, proteins and lipids. However, these are decreased when the pollen tubes have grown to a considerable length.

The model predicts that the maximum seed set occurs when females predominate, providing the pollinators visit each flower more than once and the seed set of males is not high. There is strong evidence that a marked preponderance of females in species of four genera is due to more frequent fertilisation by female-determining pollen nuclei than by male-determining nuclei. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this differential fertilisation. Several objections are raised to the hypothesis of Lewis (1942), Mulcahy (1967) and Kaplan (1972) that female-predominant sex ratios have been selected because they maximise the total seed production of populations. It is considered that the hypothesis of Smith (1963) that the differential fertilisation is a consequence of the genetic differentiation of sex chromosomes offers a more likely explanation of female-predominant sex ratios. © 1973, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015977579

With a daily interruption of 3 hr, irradiation was continuous and lasted 3 months. In all more than 25 million pollen grains were screened, via repeated self-pollination in the irradiated populations for either self-compatibility mutations or new specificities. Whereas the results obtained clearly indicated that chronic irradiation was very effective for inducing seed set upon selfing, only one unequivocal mutant could be recorded among the M2 progenies. This mutant produced compatible pollen and clearly displayed a centric fragment. Not a single case of a new specificity at the S-locus could be detected. These results are compared to those that have been obtained elsewhere after acute exposure to X-rays and the conclusion is reached that chronic irradiation is far less effective than acute treatment for inducing self-compatibility mutations. The apparent incapacity of both chronic and acute irradiation to generate new self-incompatibility alleles is discussed in relation to the spontaneous occurrence of such mutations in inbred populations. © 1974 Pergamon Press Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009995233

A replicated pilot experiment using Mimulus guttatus compared the realized gains from mass selection to realized gains using a selfed-family selection scheme. This scheme included a within-family selection step, or culling, to offset the effects of inbreeding depression, prior to selection between culled families. The average relative gains from the mass and selfed family schemes were compared with the gains predicted using three strictly additive theoretical models. The relative experimental gains were most similar to the relative gains predicted by a model which assumed that the within-family culling was effective in removing bias arising from inbreeding depression, but ineffective in taking advantage of within-family additive genetic variation. Therefore, it is argued that the biologically deleterious effects of inbreeding (short of serious loss of fecundity) may be moderated sufficiently by culling so that the theoretical relative efficiency of the selfed family scheme is not materially affected by inbreeding depression. Where selfed-family selection schemes can be shown to have a sufficient theoretical advantage over outcrossing family schemes, they may offer advantages not only in gain, but also in simplicity of mating design, and maintenance of unambiguous pedigree. © 1974, Indian Academy of Sciences.

Of the terms in the equation (Total no. of achenes - C) was found to be different in different cultivars and to be related to the position of the berry on the inflorescence, but there was no constant relationship between the achene numbers in the different ranks of berry. Whether the numbers of achenes per berry can be altered by environmental or cultural treatments was not resolved. F, a term having the dimensions of weight per area, represents weight per unit area of berry surface and seems to be constant amongst plants of a cultivar subject to uniform treatment, but differs between cultivars and treatments. The number of achenes per cm2 of surface on ripe berries is a measure of berry development in the fruiting season and may be affected by environmental and managerial factors and by internal competition between fruits and leaves on the same plant. The interactions of these factors on berry size enable two stages to be recognised at which size is determined, namely during flower formation, when achene numbers and possibly F are fixed, and during fruit development after pollination when the term for spatial distribution of achenes is settled. It is suggested that an examination of the effects of different treatments on each of the size components might enable a distinction to be drawn between the influence on yield of genetic characteristics on the one hand and intrinsically variable characteristics subject to external influence on the other hand, thus clarifying the type of research and/or development needed to enable growers to achieve maximum yields. © 1974.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549159919

There were six hybrids, either pure dent or flint x dent crosses, together with two open-pollinated flint varieties of very early maturity. Over a range of 15 densities (5.0-30.8 plants/m2) for all the genotypes the relationship between the yield of the shoot and density can be adequately described by the reciprocal equation 1/? = A+Bp, where ? = weight per plant, p = number of plants per unit area and A and B are constants for any particular set of conditions. Values of both 1/2? (asymptotic yields) and 1/A (weight per plant at very low densities) were dependent upon the genotype. In a regression analysis between 1/? and p, the variance of 1/? was over 40 times as great at high as at low densities and a weighted analysis was necessary. Some hybrids approached maximal yields at 5 plants/m2, whereas others required a density of 10-15 plants/m2. The possible reasons for these interactions are discussed and improvements in experimental design suggested. © 1974, Cambridge University Press.

There is bilateral interspecific incompatibility between N. alata and N. langsdorffii though the combinations with N. langsdorffii as female show higher compatibility than its reciprocal one. It is supposed that the gene which controls interspecific incompatibility is not a definite gene such as S in self-incompatibility, but is polygene. Though pseudo-self-compatibility in N. langsdorfjii is probably also controlled by polygene, plygenes participating in self- and interspecific-incompatibility are different each other. In both incompatibilities, the growth rate of incompatible pollen-tube is much slower than in compatible combination, and fertility increases by bud pollination.

Four different modes of inheritance of gynodioecy and dioecy are examined: (a) Heterozygous female modelfemale Mm, male mm. (b) Dual male modelfemale mm, male MM and Mm. (c) Heterozygous male modelfemale mm, male Mm only. (d) Cytoplasmic inheritance. The equilibrium frequencies of females and (for three models) the rates of change in female frequency per generation at non-equilibrium frequencies are expressed in terms of the controlling parameters. The conditions necessary for sexual dimorphism and the changes in frequencies of the sex genotypes as the number of pollinator visits increase and the relative seed fecundity decreases towards zero (dioecy) are derived for each model. Differential survival of the sexes (and differential gamete success in the heterozygous male model) cause an increase at equilibrium in the sex surviving more frequently or the sex derived from the more successful gamete. In a dioecious population, the ratio of the sexes is equal to their relative survival or their relative gamete success. Populations at non-equilibrium frequencies return more rapidly to equilibrium with the heterozygous male model than with the heterozygous female and cytoplasmic models. In the extreme case when females are lost from a population, with the heterozygous female and cytoplasmic models extinction or loss of sexual dimorphism occurs, but with the heterozygous male and dual male models sexual dimorphism is regenerated.

It was found that fluorescence techniques and electron microscopy allowed a distinction to be made between pollen tubes inhibited by a unilateral incompatibility reaction and pollen tubes inhibited by a self-incompatibility reaction, after self-pollination of the hybrids or after reciprocal crossing between the hybrid and the parental species. The observed differences, if real and reliable, demonstrate that unilateral incompatibility in esculentum pollen tubes is governed by a single gametophytic factor which is either linked or allelic to the S-locus. This finding is discussed with reference to recent reports that unilateral incompatibility is controlled, in peruvianum styles, by a number of different dominant genes and it is concluded that these dominant genes, the S-locus of self-incompatibility and the gametophytic factor regulating the unilateral reaction in esculentum pollen belong to the same linkage group. The strong sterility barriers which prevent practically all backcrosses between the hybrid and the parental species were shown to be independent of the factors regulating stylar incompatibility. L. peruvianum is heterozygous for the sterility genes which prevent fertilization or embryo formation when the interspecific hybrid is crossed, as pistillate parent, to different accessions of L. peruvianum. One peruvianum stock was found which, as a pollinator, was highly cross-fertile with the hybrids. The presence of a concentric endoplasmic reticulum in inhibited pollen tubes was observed to be a constant feature of both the self- and the unilateral incompatibility reactions and was interpreted as an indication that incompatibility might lead to a general cessation of protein synthesis. Although incompatible tubes very much resemble, in this respect, the pollen tubes cultured in vitro, it seems probable, on theoretical grounds, that the inhibition of pollen tubes in incompatible styles does not result from an absence of growth promoting substances but from the presence of a metabolic inhibitor. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000371220

These models depend on segregation data of marker genes within progeny arrays. The estimators of mating system parameters and their variance are derived for various breeding systems using either dominant or co-dominant diallelic loci. For dominant marker loci, the progeny of recessive homozygotes generally contain the most information about the level of apomixis (c). Additional data on hererozygous families are required in order to estimate the gene frequency in the pollen pool (p) or the fraction of ovules self-pollinated (s). In species capable of self-fertilisation, such data are needed to discriminate between the selling and apomictic components and thus avoid overestimates of apomixis. At co-dominant marker loci, the progeny of heterozygous mothers contribute more information about c than those of the more frequent homozygote. They can also estimate apomixis without any need for an estimate of the pollen gene frequency. All three parameters (c, s and p) are estimable when progeny data are available from all three kinds of maternal parents. A multigenic model depending simply on genotypic comparisons is also discussed. These progeny testing methods are much more applicable to populations where the level of apomixis is high than to detecting rare apomictic events. The latter are detected more efficiently by cytological procedures. The merits and demerits of estimating apomixis by progeny tests are discussed. © 1974 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966178561

Some species groups represent descending dysploid series; polyploidy has been found only in few perennial taxa. The species are strongly separated by internal isolation factors, incompatibility and hybrid sterility being the most important ones. In Vicia the speciation process is initiated by chromosomal rearrangements as an isolation mechanism, protected by this genetical barrier a divergent evolution of the new derivates may happen, the rate and the scale of it being dependent on the direction and force of the selection pressures. The self-pollination of most of the annual species of Vicia favours this process of quantum speciation even if the other isolation mechanisms are still imperfectly developped in the beginning of the speciation process. By this means a sympatric speciation is also possible, this is supported by distribution patterns of species in some groups of the genus. In this paper the experimental results of karyotype analysis and progeny testing of two lines of Vicia cordata have been discussed, these strains can be used as a model illustrating an initial speciation. The plants of them are very similar in morphological respect, their karyotypes however are clearly differentiated, the differences between them being in the same order as between good species of the Vicia sativa complex. The V. cordata strains are genetically isolated (besides their autogamy) by an incompatibility barrier, the fertility of the heterozygous individuals is however only slightly reduced. One of these strains has a karyotype typically for the species V. cordata while the structurally changed one of the second strain results from a chromosomal interchange. It is possible to identify those chromosomes involved in the reciprocal translocation by a comparison of the mitotic complement of both the strains, by the meiotic behaviour of their hybrids and by cytological testing of their progenies. Similar interchanges should be due to the karyotype evolution within the V. sativa complex at all according to the discussed dates. Some of the chromosomes of these taxa however have not been affected by major structural rearrangements, they are forming regular bivalents in the species hybrids indicating thus an high degree of homology. The utilization of interspecific gene transfer by recombination seems therefore possible for breeding purposes. We suppose that quantum speciation with a primary development of internal isolation followed by phylogenetic divergence is an important evolutionary pathway within many mainly annual and autogamous plant groups. © 1973 Akademie-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250428663

A maximum of 4 ears per plant was maintained. The mean of the absolute number of extruding anthers per ear varied from 105 (Peko) to 170 (Gaby). Also, significant differences were established in the absolute number of extruding anthers divided by the number of seeds set in each ear; this value ranged on an average of 2.27 (Opal) to 3.58 (Gaby). It is remarkable that a variety-ear number interaction manifests itself for both mentioned data: as far as Jufy is concerned the first developing ear produces least, whereas in Orca and Peko it produces most. No significant differences in this respect occur between the first 4 ears of a plant of the varieties Gaby and Opal. A simple relationship between number of extruding anthers and pollen donor capacity on the field could not be demonstrated. The flowering pattern and duration of ears and plants of these five varieties varies considerably. The mean flowering duration of each individual ear runs from 4.92 (Opal) to 6.35 days (Jufy). In addition to this a difference in flowering pattern is found, i.e. a certain number of days after the beginning of flowering Jufy appears to have turned out the smallest percentage of its total production of extruding anthers, while Opal had produced the greatest (Fig. 2). As regards this phenomenon, the first ear of a plant generally appears to lag significantly behind the second and third. Trying to explain these phenomena, on the one hand it was taken into account that in the case of varieties which extrude many anthers, florets of the third rank and higher will be more involved; these are not scored until later in the flowering period of the ear, which implies a proportionally smaller share for the first flowering days. On the other hand a slower or faster physiological flowering process is supposed. There appears to be a much bigger difference in outset of flowering between the first and the second ear of a plant than between the second and the third. For Jufy the first mentioned difference is bigger than for the other varieties. The mean flowering duration per plant of these five varieties varies (for 3 ears per plant) from 8.6 (Opal) to 10.7 days (Jufy). © 1973 H.

Both S. acaule (2n=4x) and S. phureja (2n=2x) were used as bridging species. Triploid S. acaule × S. bulbocastanum were doubled with colchicine and the resulting fertile hexaploid F1's crossed with S. phureja. The triple hybrids obtained were tetraploid or nearly so. The two genomes of S. acaule in these triple hybrids probably pair preferentially, which may provoke pairing and possibly crossing over between the chromosomes of S. bulbocastanum and S. phureja. More than 20000 pollinations of the triple hybrids with four potato cultivars had to be made to produce 40 quadruple hybrids. These highly vigorous hybrids varied greatly in many morphological characters, resistance to Phytophthora infestans, fertility and crossability. The chromosome numbers are 48 (24 hybrids), 49 and 46, but some higher ploidy levels (65, 66, 72 chromosomes) were found as well. Their origin is to be sought in the fusion of an unreduced egg cell from triple hybrids (either euploid or hypoploid) and a reduced male gamete from the cultivars. This view is corroborated by their extreme resistance to Phytophthora. Also some 48-chromosome hybrids are highly resistant, which may indicate introgression from S. bulbocastanum. Most quadruple hybrids are readily inter-crossable and crossable as females with cultivars; several also as males. Two could be hybridized with S. bulbocastanum, but the few seeds dit not germinate. Studies of pachytene stage of meiosis revealed the presence of a S. bulbocastanum chromosome in at least one tetraploid hybrid, which is highly resistant to Phytophthora. At metaphase I of meiosis chromosome associations higher than quadrivalents were not found. Except in one hybrid, the frequency of quadrivalents did not exceed one per cell and the average proportion of chromosomes associated as bivalents amounted to 90%. The quadruple hybrids ('double-bridge' hybrids) appear good starting material for breeding programmes aimed at introducing genes from S. bulbocastanum into S. tuberosum cultivars. © 1973 H.

The level of linoleic acid in the two mutants is the same as Oro (16-20%), but the levels of oleic and linolenic acids are inversely altered. In this paper several problems associated with selecting for linoleic and linolenic acids, which became apparent during the mutation studies, are discussed. Many selections made from the mutated material were unstable, reverting to the original Oro fatty acid composition after two or three self-pollinated generations.

Plants obtained from such egg cells contain chromosomes of the female only and are called dihaploids. The successful selection of ideal pollinators from Group Phureja is described. A pollinator is considered to be ideal, if it has good male fertility, homozygosity for the dominant seed marker embryo-spot and the ability to induce in autotetraploid cultivars a high number of dihaploids both per berry and per 100 seeds. Embryo-spot is a deep purple or reddish coloration at the base of the cotyledons of the embryo, visible on both sides of the flat seeds. It is one manifestation of a set of complementary genes with pleiotropic action, causing a concentration of anthocyanins at the base of all plant organs that are homologous to leaves. The complementary genes are: a basic gene P for anthocyanin production (this is the seedling marker 'coloured hypocotyl') and allele Bd of locus B. Thirty-three homozygous BdBdPP plants and 41 BdbPP plants were identified and a number from both classes tested as pollinator onto varieties. Among the homozygous group a number of 'ideal pollinators' could be detected. Unexpectedly a few polyploids grew from spotless seeds when using homozygous pollinators on varieties; 1.4% showed purple hypocotyl and 2.6% were matroclinous. The latter group of polyploids probably may have arisen from 'unreduced' egg cells of the cultivars used. In the progenies from crosses between recessive cultivars (bbbbpppp) and heterozygous pollinators (BdbPP) the ratio of spotted: spotless hybrid seeds appeared to deviate greatly from 1:1. This is ascribed to 'unreduced' gametes, which originate during meiosis, presumably through lack of formation of the 'reductional' (= first division) cell wall. On this assumption a map distance of 30 and 24 cross-over units is estimated for locus B on the basis of the proportion of nulliplex tetraploid hybrids in two different crosses. High- and low-seed-set pollinators were found at a ratio of 8:21 suggesting monogenic dominance of low seed-set. Seeds per berry and haploids per berry are significantly correlated using low-seed-set pollinators on cultivars, but they are not when pollinators are used that produce high numbers of seeds per berry. A hypothesis is put forward to explain this phenomenon. © 1973 H. Veenman en Zonen N.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001028690

The effect of a relatively low temperature during the growth period is reflected in a comperatively greater number of flowers as a result of an increase in number of ramifications of the peduncle. This sometimes promotes the seed yield notwithstanding that the lower temperature reduces the fertility of each seperate flower. It is clearly proved that the temperature during flowering and pollination affects the fertility of the flower and the ultimate seed yield of the plant. Experiments in our phytotron showed 14°C during the growth period and 20°C at the time of pollination to be the optimum combination for a good seed yield. The effect of a lower night temperature was generally favourable, particularly so when measured by the number of seeds per pollinated flower. © 1973 H.

On the other hand, in non-pollinated styles the content of rRNA is only about 6 times higher than that of tRNA. The changes in nucleic acid level found in styles after pollination are at least in a major part the result of the addition of the nucleic acids present in the amount of pollen used for pollination.

The germination of pollen, and especially the growth of pollen tubes was better in a 0.3 M lactose solution with 10-3 per cent H3BO3 than in usual sucrose media.

A dependence was revealed of the proliferation on pollination and on the cultivar employed. When using the method of placental pollination in vitro we failed to obtain seeds.

Applications were made from 1 to 50 days after full bloom following partial hand-pollination of flowers, i.e. two stigmas per flower pollinated. In another experiment applications were made from 1 to 20 days after full bloom following complete (five stigmas per flower) or partial (two stigmas per flower) hand-pollination, after open pollination, or on emasculated flowers. GA4 + 7 only temporarily increased fruit set after open pollination or after effemination of flowers, and then only after application 1 day after full bloom. GA4 + 7 did not affect the very high fruit set after complete or partial hand-pollination. Both latter pollination treatments induced an equally high fruit set. GA4 + 7 reduced June drop significantly whenever fruits were left after first drop, except after early applications following open pollination. GA4 + 7 was effective in June-drop reduction up to 40 days after full bloom, i.e. until the onset of the June drop. Fruit size was not clearly affected by GA4 + 7. The smaller fruits obtained in some cases after GA treatment could be explained by assuming that maturity was reached by fruits that would have abscised without an exogenous GA4 + 7 supply. GA4 + 7 also increased seed abortion. Fruit length was increased by GA4 + 7 only for applications made up to 20 days after full bloom. GA4 + 7 stimulated bourse-shoot development to some extent. Flower-bud formation on the bourses was not clearly affected by GA4 + 7, but was markedly influenced by the presence of fruits. That GA4 + 7 reduced June drop so much in spite of a slight promotive effect on bourse-shoot growth and a slight abortive action on seeds suggests that these gibberellins may be specific stimuli for apple-fruit growth after actual fruit set is achieved. © 1973.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549170262

The changes in the internal atmosphere of the ripening fig have a decisive effect on the activity of males and females of the pollinating wasp. During the early stages of the male phase of Ficus religiosa, the internal atmosphere of the fig consists of about 10% CO2, 10% O2 and some ethylene. The males of the pollinator, Blastopliaga quadraticeps, carry out their usual activities in perforating the walls of the galls and in fertilizing the females under these conditions while at the same time the females are inactivated. After perforation of the syconia wall by the males, the atmosphere within the fig becomes equilibrated with the external atmosphere. As a result, male wasps are inhibited, whereas the females become active, leave their galls, load pollen pockets with pollen and emerge from the fig. The differential response of male and female wasps to the changes in the composition of the internal atmosphere within the fig ensures the completion of the developmental cycle of both the pollinator and the fig. Differences in the behaviour of wasp pollinators of different Ficus spp. under normal conditions are regarded as adaptations to diversely composed internal atmospheres within male?phase figs of the respective species.

Nasal IgE concentrations in allergic subjects were consistently elevated as compared to nonallergic subjects. The IgE content of nasal washings varied directly with total protein content.

Nasal IgE TP rose in most allergic patients during the ragweed pollination season, with the hyposensitized patients again showing a more sustained elevation.

The New Zealand alpine and subalpine habitats only developed in the past few million years, during which they have been profoundly and repeatedly altered by Pleistocene glaciations and finally by man. As these habitats developed in isolation they were colonised mainly by plants derived from Australia, as a result of long-distance dispersal. Westward dispersal, in the face of the prevailing westerlies, is almost ruled out for Australasian plants. In New Zealand, many of them evolved rapidly to produce numerous species in consequence of the processes of adaptive radiation, interspecific hybridisation and recombination, and in many instances self-pollination. These large clusters of species, when compared with the relatively few members of the same groups in Australia, have previously led to the impression that the Australian representatives were derived from New Zealand. In fact, it seems to have been the unusual opportunities for rapid evolution, in response to a novel, isolated, and rapidly changing environment, that has led to the far greater representation of species in New Zealand. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000856776

The unilateral incompatibility barrier which isolates the two species when L. peruvianum is used as pistillate parent was then compared to the processes of pollen tube rejection which have been recently analysed (J. Cell Sci., 1972) after self-pollination in this self-incompatible species. Such a comparison, which was also carried out by means of fluorescence techniques, has permitted to find out that for both types of incompatibility the rejection process was characterised by a progressive disappearance of the callose-rich inner wall of the pollen tube and by an accumulation of bi-partite particles in the tube cytoplasm. In the case of unilateral incompatibility, however, the tube outer wall is gradually disaggregated while the callosic inner wall remains quite thick at the tube apex, becoming thinner and finally opening only at the very tip of the apical zone. As a result of this complete degradation of the apical wall the cross-incompatible pollen tube merely opens in the stylar tissue and does not accomplish the burstin process which had been found so typical of the self-incompatibility reaction. These observations support the hypothesis that unilateral incompatibility is governed by a mechanism which is related but no identical to the one controlling self-incompatibility. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84932010880

Dispersal of unadorned fruits and seeds by wind (e.g., Betula, Rhoiptelea, Casuarina) has preceded the development of more efficient air-borne devices (e.g., Ostrya, Carpinus, Engelhardia). Animal dispersal is the most advanced strategy, relying rarely on drupes, as in the shrubby Myricaceae, or on nuts, as in Corylus, Quercus, Carya, Juglans, Alfaroa, etc. The pattern of seedling establishment shows a structural-functional relationship to the seeddispersal strategy. Epigeal germination predominates in plants of open habitats. Those species with small fruits rely on wind dispersal, and their seeds have a relatively short germination time, whereas species with medium-sized fruits are often animal-dispersed with seeds that may have protracted germination times. In either case the reserve food supply for the young seedling is limited, and light is needed to spark photosynthesis. Hypogeal germination has evolved independently in several amentiferous families (e.g., Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae). This pattern is associated with closed habitats and plants with large seeds that have the capability of establishing vigorous seedlings in microhabitats of reduced light intensity where photosynthesis is impaired. The subterranean protection afforded the cotyledons and axillary meristems is a correlative feature that may have considerable importance in seedling survival where desiccation and predation are intense. © 1973, The New York Botanical Garden.

'Purple leaf', A. lividus var. lividus X A. tricolor var. viridis and A. gracilis X A. tricolor cv. 'Purple leaf') were studied cytologically. In all the three, differentiation between the parents is chiefly a result of interchanges and paracentric inversions. The interchange complexes may involve from four (A. gracilis X A. tricolor cv. 'Purple leaf') to fourteen (A. lividus var. lividus X A. tricolor var. viridis) chromosomes, indicating that the parents differ from each other in 1 to 6 interchanges. Because of the small size of the chromosomes, it is possible that crossing-over in interchange for small segments is restricted. The particular parental species representing the ancestral condition from which others were derived or compounded is difficult to pin-point. With preferential pairing and the restoration of fertility in the amphidiploid A. lividus-tricolor, it became clear that it is very likely that the interchanged segments are small and sterility in the hybrid is entirely chromosomal. This situation is in strong contrast to that in Sect. Amaranthus, where the single male flower per glomerule and huge showy inflorescences lead to more cross-pollination; coupled with this are strong morphological divergences between taxa and less genetic differentiation. In the Sect. Blitopsis, there are a number of male flowers per glomerule and small non-showy axillary inflorescences, leading to self-pollination, and less morphological but strong genetic differentiation by interchanges and inversions. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007929722

Its small size together with the cold temperatures results in high energetic demands on the birds. The energetic efficiency with which Selasphorus could extract nectar from Tropaeolum flowers was estimated by measuring foraging rates at individual flowers and estimating nectar production rates between flower visits. Extraction efficiency was expressed in caloric terms by converting hovering time to caloric expenditure and nectar volume to caloric intake through measurements of nectar concentration. 1. Selasphorus had a low rate of nectar extraction from Tropaeolum flowers. However, both Tropaeolum and Salvia flowers produced nectar that was more concentrated than the nectar from other flowers sampled in the mountain regions of Cost Rica. 2. The small size of these flowers may preclude providing large volumes of nectar, but the high nectar concentration could increase nectar extraction efficiency. The differences in nectar concentration between flowers probably is related to the strategy used by the flowers to achieve pollination. 3. Information on mean available nectar volumes for unprotected Salvia flowers enabled a rough estimate of rate of visitation of Selasphorus at Salvia and the number of flowers necessary to provide a neutral energy budget. The calculations indicate that a female Selasphorus should visit individual Salvia flowers about once every 5 hours. To account for foraging and resting metabolic costs during the day and incubating costs at night, a nesting female should visit about 540 flowers/hr or about 2700 flowers/day. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038572169

Opposed ideas are critically compared and rejected mainly on account of several inconsistencies and flaws in old floral concepts. Floral evolution passed from a very early phase of dicliny, anemophily and aphananthy of the anthocorm to a phase of incipient entomophily soon associated with a partial sex reversal within the anthocorm. This second phase culminated in the monoclinous and primarily zoophilous flower types, whereas other floral types, more particularly the primarily anemophilous, diclinous flowers, are the direct descendants of the anthocorms of the initial phase. The second phase (to be differentiated in phase II and phase IIA) gave rise to at least two morphologically different flower types and two separate semophyletic lines of floral evolution (phase III and III A), in each of which the primary zoophily is almost always associated with the development of intrafloral semaphylls (petals) usually (at least in dicotyledonous groups) of androecial derivation. Early flower types were aphananthous and clearly anthocormoid (a condition still approximately represented by the so-called inflorescences of the Saururaceae) and assumed the morphology and other characteristics of a true flower by contractions, condensations, readjustments, oligomerisations, reductions and modifications (semaphylls!) leading to the great variety of adaptive floral patterns. © 1972 E.

A number of circumstances such as semantic inconsistencies, but principally the choice of inadequate archetypes, prevented the success of the theory of a polystachyous floral region, because the deductions and interpretations emanating from this concept were not sufficiently convincing to defeat the opposed theory of the uniaxial euanthous flower or anthostrobilus hypothesis. Only after the amendation of the theory of a multiaxial reproductive region on the basis of the anthocorm concept can one arrive at a plausible idea of the evolution of the angiospermous flower which is compatible with all aspects of the phylogeny of the Flowering Plants (such as the sex distribution and the mode of pollination), and with the floral morphology and anatomy of the various kinds of flowers. © 1972 E.

Breeding good pollinators is, therefore, a necessity. Five spring wheat varieties were examined for differences in pollen shedding capacity under normal field conditions. The examination was carried out by collecting pollen on object slides every hour from 06.00 till 20.00 h during flowering. In general, the variety Peko proved to be the best shedder of pollen, while Opal was the worst. Gaby, Jufy I and Orca were intermediate. Consistent results were hard to obtain mainly due to varying weather conditions. It was established that pollen is released throughout the whole period of daylight. The maximum release of pollen, however, occurred from 08.00 till 11.00 h. A less pronounced and much smaller peak was noticed from about 15.00 till 18.00 h. Most pollen appeared to be released at a temperature of 16-20°C and a relative humidity of 70-75%. Although there seems to be some relationship between the diurnal pattern of the pollen release and the indicated values of these meteorological factors, one cannot say that the former is entirely determined by the latter. It has been suggested in the literature that a male-sterile parent that is shorter than its pollinator would be most likely to produce good seed set in the hybrid wheat seed production field. Investigations showed that a greater concentration of pollen was found below the ear level of pollinator plants than at or above ear level. © 1972 H.

The two may augment or run counter to each other. Furthermore, the genus also contains sexual and agamospermous species. The latter are often self-pollinated and pseudogamous. Z. sulphurea (2n=48) when pollinated with Z. candida (2n=40 and 41) has consistently given rise to seedlings with maternal chromosome number and morphology. Z. lancasteri and cv. 20 also behave similarly. This is a strong pointer for their being agamospermous, although a final proof will come from an embryological study. The intraspecific polymorphism within agamospermous taxa in the genus may be the result of autosegregation. On the other hand, the crosses involving sexual species like Z. candida (2n=41) as the female parent have generated a large heterogeneous progeny ranging in chromosome number from 2n=33 to 48 depending upon the number in the male parent. Such versatility of the breeding system together with chromosomal repatterning, hybridization, polyploidy and vegetative multiplication/apomixis explains the origin and preservation of an astonishing range in chromosome numbers from 2n=18 to 96. © 1972 H.

From more than 22,000 self-pollinations on 5 clones 1527 seeds were obtained, seed set being very erratic. The possible causes of this seed set are discussed. From 1527 seeds 1036 plants were raised and tested for self-compatibility. In the progenies of 4 clones from 823 plants tested, 7 were more or less self-compatible.

In the progeny of the fifth clone plants were found which reacted as self-compatible at a temperature of about 40°C and as self-incompatible at lower temperatures. It is suggested that this character-a high temperature sensitive incompatibility reaction-is governed by one recessive gene.

The selfed 4x populations, when compared with their 2x equivalents, suffered more yield depression than was expected on the basis of the theoretic approach to homozygosity associated with selfing in autotetraploids. The inbreeding depression was partly attributed to (a) the approach to homozygosity, and (b) the fact that partially homozygous 4x S1 individuals were probably unable to make compensating growth when located adjacent to a low vigor aneuploid plant.

Experienced nectar gatherers, however, trip lucerne flowers accidentally only producing mostly self fertilization. At the same time, at en masse occurrence honeybees may be of disadvantageous influence on the activity of wild bees. Namely, in the case of unusual overpopulation aggressive attitude of the nectar gathering honeybees towards wild bees may be observed. In the case of a moderate overpopulation honeybees often disturb the flower visiting wild bees accidentally. In temperate and humid areas where the density of wild bees is economically significant in lucerne fields, the positive role of honeybees in lucerne pollination is doubtful.

Each line, and also individual genotypes at Adelaide, yielded consistently in all harvests and at both sites. The Australian cultivar Hunter River, African, and Spanish line, gave the highest yields. Nine plants with the most consistent yields, and representing a range from low to high yields, were selected from the Hunter River and Spanish lines in the Adelaide experiment, were clonally multiplied: and exposed to different intensities of pollination in a third experiment. The pollination intensities were total exclusion of bees, exposure to casual visits from ambient bees, and exposure to a low bee density and a high bee density within pollination cages. Seed yields were negligible when bees were excluded. They were larger when exposed to casual bee visits, and larger still but similar at low and high bee densities in cages. There were large yield differences between genotypes, but there was no significant interaction between genotypes and the three intensities of pollination involving bees. There were large genotypic differences in the pathways to seed production, through raceme and floret development, with large differences in potential seed production, but these were not correlated with actual seed production. Even in the most efficient genotypes, at the highest pollination intensity, only one quarter of the potential seed yield was realised. © 1972 CSIRO.

Tabulated results pertain to four two-year periods for the Exp. Sta. Chory? and two such periods for the Exp. Sta. Laski, involving several plant material groups derived from various crosses with Da?kowskie Selekcyjne rye. The effects of average grain weight per ear of the maternal plant on the corresponding yields in the offspring have proved rather small, but sporadically approaching or attaining the limits of significance. The influence of resistance to lodging of the maternal plant on that same character in the offspring has proved no greater, but, in spite of the considerable multidirectional differentiation of the coefficients of correlation and regression, in 4 groups out of a total of 27 they surpassed the limits of significance, sometimes attaining high values. In contrast to these two characters, but in agreement with expectations, there was a fairly pronounced effect of 1000 grain weight and of the maternal plant height on the same characters in the offspring. Significant coefficients of regression for the former characters ranged from 0.11 to 0.22 g, and for the latter from 0.03 to 0.37 cm. The present paper also includes less numerous results of analogous investigations on the relation of characters determined in the microtrials with those examined in the next generation. These results indicate good transmission of earliness, measured by the date of earing, and of the weight of 1000 grains, but a much weaker transmission of resistance to lodging and of grain yields. The conclusions drawn on breeding strategy suggest opportunities for efficient selection under the method of recombination towards short straw and a high 1000 grain weight within maternal plants, and also the advisability of shifting the main impact of selection for yield and resistance to lodging onto the following generations. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250452197

M1 plants were raised following (i) pollination with irradiated male gametophyte on unirradiated stigma, (ii) pollination with unirradiated pollen on irradiated female gametophyte and (iii) both irradiated male and female gametophytes. A total of 2396 M2 progenies coming from one or two spikes per each m1 plant were analyzed in M2 for chlorophyll, morphological and sterile mutations. The total mutation frequency, expressed as number of segregating progenies per 100 M1 plants analyzed, was 27·23, 18·03 and 8·34 after irradiation of both, and male and female gametophytes, respectively. Moreover, the spectrum of chlorophyll and morphological mutations induced after irradiation of male, female and both male and female gametophytes does not allow the detection of any large difference among the different treatments. The highest mutation frequency was reached in the progeny of M1 plants which showed a fertility reduced to 40-50 per cent of the control value. Furthermore, the M1 sterility, the total mutation frequency and the mutation types show insignificant differences, regardless of the degree of the development of the irradiated gametophytes. These results show that irradiation of both gametophytes, which gives the highest frequency of mutations without chimerism, is a very simple method and a valid tool for breeding. Among the mutants isolated in this experiment was a very early type (blooming 25 days earlier than control) ; it has been increased due to its agronomical interest. © 1972 Pergamon Press Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649139455

Of these six are Indian forms and special attention has been paid to them. It was found that the diploids could be crossed with each other and also with natural tetraploids fairly easily, but never with the hexaploids. Crosses between two tetraploids or two hexaploids readily produced hybrids. In general, in crosses involving two ploidy levels, a cross succeeds when the higher ploidy plant was crossed as the seed parent; but exceptions were found wherein the lower ploidy plant could be successfully used as the seed parent. In this respect all diploid races are not isolated from the tetraploid races to the same extent; some races were divergent enough to be crossed only as male parents while others could be crossed in either direction. Compared to this diver-gence in crossability relationships hybrids sterility seems to be the major hurdle for gene exchange between the diploids and tetraploids. The Indian diploid and tetraploid races are isolated to a lesser extent as compared to the European diploid and tetraploid races. Autopolyploidy reverses crossability relationships. The diploid S. nigrum of India as seed parent crosses with natural tetraploid S. nigrum of India but fails to cross with natural hexaploid S. nigrum of India. However, the autotetraploid of diploid S. nigrum crosses with natural hexaploid and fails to hybridize with natural tetraploid. In addition to self-pollination and geographic isolation as factors restricting gene exchange between the different forms, hybrid sterility, hybrid breakdown and hybrid inviability were found to be operative in the complex. Diploid and hexaploid races of S. nigrum of India are isolated by hybrid inviability, while the diploid and tetraploid races of S. nigrum of India are isolated by hybrid sterility. © 1972, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

This was done by mixing together seed of a vigorous and a less vigorous genotype in calculated proportions. The less vigorous represented the inbred component which would result from selfing and sibbing within the constituent lines, while the more vigorous represented the hybrid fraction. The difference in yield between the two genotypes was comparable with the level of enhancement which could be expected in the hybrids as a result of heterosis. Root yields of these populations in the field suggest that depression due to the presence of inbred individuals in a synthetic variety may be predicted by a mathematical model. Yields calculated from the model to allow for various levels of compensation enabled the order of magnitude of the compensation to be estimated. However, the presence of quite small numbers of less vigorous individuals was detectable. Given the limitations imposed by the assumptions necessary to simulate these varieties, the optimal number of lines for an open-pollinated variety may be predicted. © 1972, Cambridge University Press.

The pattern of release of polygenic variability and the degree of shifts in mean values were examined in terms of range, coefficient of variation and the mean from the M2 to M4 generation. Selection was practised in M3 plants which were at least 10 days earlier in first flowering and with a minimum of 20 seeds per siliqua. The selected genotypes were permitted to intercross in isolations in the M4 generation. The specific radiation treatments generated additional variability without altering the mean values of two traits in different generations.

A higher seeds/fruit ratio was found in crosses where dihaploids from different taxonomic groups were involved. This ratio amounted to 1.9 in interdihaploid crosses within group Tuberosum, 17.0 in Tuberosum dihaploids X Phureja and 41.0 in Tuberosum dihaploids X Andigena dihaploids. Two clones, one from group Tuberosum and one from group Andigena showed self?compatibility when artificially pollinated. When dihaploid hybrid combinations, rather than primary dihaploids were crossed, a higher seeds/fruit ratio was found in crosses where dihaploid hybrid combinations did not have ancestors in common. Diallel crosses between dihaploids with a different degree of hybridity and between their F1 plants did not show the typical pattern of intra?incompatible and inter?compatible classes. Unilateral incompatibility was not found in crosses between a self?incompatible dihaploid hybrid and a self?compatible clone from S. verrucosum. The complete sterility found in crosses between colchicine?doubled dihaploids was related to a disturbed physiological balance rather than to the formation of incompatible specificities in the diploid pollen. In the account of the results presented, it was tempting to propose that in potato dihaploids the expression of the gametophytic incompatibility system, so well proved in some diploid species of Solanum, has been so heavily affected by the interaction of Si alleles with other factors that, for the moment and with our present techniques, we find it difficult to reach an acceptable understanding.

The cap-like structure covering the shoot-tip in many species is interpreted as a modified prophyll. A ligulate development and the inclusion of the inflorescence within the sheathing leaf-base in a few species are discussed. Diminution and compaction of the floral parts are interpreted as an evolutionary response to the activities of small pollen-collecting bees. Compaction of the floral parts is correlated with a truncation of the pistil apex and, in a few species, with a change in the mode of anther dehiscence. Apical and upward dehiscence of the anthers are interpreted as similar adaptations caused by a restriction of the pollinators activity to the surface of the spike. A relationship between ants and certain hollow-stemmed species is mentioned.

The measurements of the radioactive pollen and ovule samples were made with a Geiger?Müller counter. The number of pollen contents per ovule was determined by dividing the radioactivity of the ovule sample by the radioactivity per pollen grain plus the number of ovules. This was possible since evidence was obtained that all radioactive phosphorus left the pollen grain and entered the ovule, and that the florets within the whorl are often equivalent. In the present experiments, polyspermy in charlock (Sinapis arvensis L.) was studied. Flowers were pollinated with pollen from single stamens that were labelled with P?32. The activity per pollen grain, as well as the activity per ovule (or seed), was determined by means of an anticoincidence arrangement for low?level beta radiation. A high frequency of polyspermy, and of wide varying degree, was found in the experimental material. The highest number found was about 33 contents of pollen grains per ovule. With a certain significance, it was demonstrated that the values of the number of contents of pollen grains per ovule coincide with the uneven numbers and an interval of 4 in the integer series. The number of pollen contents per ovule is to a great extent dependent on the location of both the female and male flowers on the plant.

When taken in conjunction with other data, it is clear that in tetraploid taxa (2n=24) generally there is normal meiosis with 12 II but at higher polyploid and aneuploid levels, a low number of multivalents in the form of rings or chains involving 3 to 8 or even more chromosomes has been consistently found. The number of chromosomes within an interchange complex is often more than the level of polyploidy, implying thereby that most of the higher ploids are complex interchange heterozygotes. Evidently, bivalent formation in tetraploids indicates that the differentiation of the chromosomes is relatively high at that level, but at higher levels chromosomes are homoeologous and form multivalents and interchange complexes. It follows, that lower ploids are alloploids with relatively simple constitution but higher ploids are complex interchange heterozygotes. This conclusion is in line with the karyotypic analysis. Although recombination in the latter is expected to contain a number of disharmonious combinations, but because of the large amount of duplicated material, the amount of sterility is not particularly high.

Due to autotriploid nature of the seedless guava, the association of chromosomes at met. I varied considerably, which in turn had profound influence on anaphase I separation. The separation pattern at ana. I with 14-19 chromosomes was highest (24%), and lowest in 8-25 separation (2%). The frequency of all the chromosomes going to one pole was 6 percent. Although the stainability of pollen grains were 44 percent in triploid, they were ineffective in fertilization. The progeny raised from open pollinated seeds were, therefore, the result of pollination from diploid plants. From the frequency of observed and expected progeny, the gametic selection was inferred. The gametes with very high and low chromosome numbers appeared to be eliminated, as no plant beyond 34 somatic chromosome numbers were observed in the progeny. The frequency of occurrence of more plants with 22 and 24 somatic chromosomes clearly supported the theory of gamete selection. © 1972, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Significant changes can be obtained by modifying tree form, growth rate and disease resistance. (a) Compression wood can be reduced by developing straighter trees. The inheritance of straightness is so strong that one generation of selection has resulted in enough improvement to enable deemphasis of this characteristic in second-generation breeding. (b) Branch size affects the final product by knot volume and the associated compression wood, included bark and resin; it is moderately genetically controlled. (c) Use of disease-resistant trees not only results in greater wood volume but in higher quality wood. Logs infected with fusiform rust give lower pulp yields and lower mullen and tensile strength in the paper. (d) Growth rate has a limited effect on wood qualities in mature loblolly pine. It is possible to have fast growth combined with either high or low specific gravity wood, since these characteristics are not closely related genetically. 2. Inheritance of wood qualities per se is strong enough to obtain meaningful changes in both yield and quality of pulp and paper. (a) Wood specific gravity, which is really a complex of several characteristics, has responded well to selection. Specific gravity differences affect yield, quality and cost from harvesting to the end product. (b) Cell wall thickness appears to be the most important morphological characteristic that affects pulp and paper qualities; it is moderately genetically controlled directly and also controlled through specific gravity. (c) Pulp yield per unit volume increases when specific gravity is increased; also, 1 to 7 percent greater yields are found per unit weight dry wood. (d) Parent trees with juvenile wood of high or low specific gravity produce progeny with juvenile wood similar to the parents. Pulping tests showed high gravity juvenile wood had characteristics similar to mill run chips. (e) Moisture content inheritance closely parallels that of specific gravity. (f) All important wood morphological characteristics tested are under enough genetic control to obtain useful gains. A review of the inheritance of chemical characteristics revealed the existence of few definitive studies. Cellulose yield is inherited in such a manner that selection will not be effective, whereas, oppositely, resin content is inherited in a manner allowing gains to be made through selection. Because of the relationship between chemical characteristics and wood morphological characteristics such as specific gravity, breeding for one will generally affect the other. A previously unreported study of six trees from six control-pollinated families, all of which had the same mother but different fathers, showed that the sugar contents of the six families were essentially constant; glucose varied from 65 to 70 percent but this difference was not statistically meaningful. Polysaccharide differences were not closely related to specific gravity. Because of the close relationship between morphological and chemical characteristics it is the author's opinion that breeding for chemical differences should be limited to those instances in which it is specially useful for yield improvement. It is possible to manipulate wood in a desired direction by breeding for characteristics that affect wood or by breeding for the wood characteristics directly. Enough is now known about the effect of differing wood properties on the final product so that the worth of changes obtained can be assessed in terms of economic or utilization values. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005075499

The main deterrent to their wider use is the present high cost of seed production. This can be greatly reduced by breeding into these crops systems for controlled cross-fertilization. In those crops whose flowers lack nectaries (e.g. tomatoes and lettuce), self-incompatibility appears to offer a more efficient cross-fertilizing system than male sterility. Self-incompatibility systems are already available in species of tomatoes, lettuce and beans. The prospect of finding self-incompatibility in other species closely related to the remaining self-fertilized crops appears to be good. Besides introducing self-incompatibility into self-fertilized crops, the breeder also needs to introduce an efficient system of pollen transfer between plants. © 1971 H.

The tests were made by counting the number of pollen tubes present in the style 24 hours after pollination, by means of the Ultra-violet Fluorescence technique. The results showed that the degree of self-compatibility varied widely, being greatest during the middle to late stages of the flowering period, at the highest temperature treatment applied. No mean differences could be detected between the effects of self- or sib-pollination; or between pollination of flowers of different ages. One of the inbred lines showed a greater response than all the others to the highest temperature at a late stage of flowering. Under these conditions this inbred line showed more than a tenfold increase in the number of tubes growing after self-pollination, as compared with the overall mean of the experiment. This result is interpreted as indicating a modifying effect of the genetic background on the expression of the major S-allele.

Apart from three trihaploids a large population of triple hybrids was obtained, showing chromosome mosaicism in root tip cells (euploid + hypoploid chromosome numbers) and a uniform, mostly hypoploid chromosome number in the pollen mother cells. It is demonstrated that somatic chromosome elimination in the early stages of development is the most probable cause. From detailed pachytene observations as well as from the chromosome associations observed at metaphase I it is evident, that there is normal pairing between the four genomes in the triple hybrids. Although S. bulbocastanum is a quite distinct species with a rigid crossability barrier with S. phureja, the chromosomes of these two species appear to have a high degree of homology. Especially the formation of quadrivalents involving all twelve groups of four homeologous chromosomes, indicated that the four parental genomes (two from S. acaule, one from S. bulbocastanum and one from S. phureja) are not differentiated to the extent of affecting normal pairing and chiasma formation. These results support the view, that the transfer of valuable characters from S. bulbocastanum to S. tuberosum cultivars is feasible even when these characters are polygenically controlled. © 1971 H.

The transfer of immature embryos from maternal plants to artificial media influenced the radial arrangement of vascular bundles in developing root primordia. The variability in the number of poles of the prospective protoxylem and protophloem, observed as a rule during embryogenesis under natural conditions, could not be suppressed even under the conditions of in vitro cultivation. The possibility is admitted that when using agar medium the nutrient supply need not necessarily be equivalent for all embryos. 2. Using excised embryos of various ages the period of delimination of the vascular system in the root primordium was determined. It is relatively short and occurs in the first half of embryogenesis. The results obtained revealed no relationship between vascular system arrangement in root primordium and mature grain and mature embryo size. 3. Maize ear represents a type of inflorescence of which the apical part is delayed in development. Histogenically this uneven development becomes evident with the formation of a significantly lower mean number of poles in root primordia from the grains originating from the apical region of the cob. This is further evidence of the adaptibility of the vascular system development to environmental conditions. 4.

The range of hybridization undertaken involved diploidxdiploid, and tetraploid x tetraploid control crossings, diploid x tetraploid crosses, tetraploid x diploid crosses and mixed pollinations. The seed set, the germination capacity of resultant hybrid seeds, and the chromosome constitution of derived seedlings was determined. In addition attempts were made to culture 12 day-old hybrid embryos from the diploid x tetraploid and reciprocal crosses. The crossing results obtained indicated no barrier to fertilization between diploids and tetraploids, but the irregular and poor development of the seed accompanied by much reduced germination, indicated unsatisfactory endosperm establishment of large numbers of triploids, as confirmed by the result of culturing embryos dissected from 12-day old ""seeds"". In preliminary studies undertaken to determine the extent to which diploid and tetraploid ryegrass varieties intercross when grown in close proximity for seed production, Griffiths and Pegler (1966) observed a very low incidence of triploids amongst the progenies of diploid plants exposed to the pollen of tetraploid plants and also amongst the progenies of tetraploid material exposed to the pollen of diploid plants. In these and subsequent studies it was noted that only a very small proportion of the so-called fully formed seeds derived from diploid x tetraploid crosses did actually germinate. When, in 1964, propagules of clones of S.24 perennial ryegrass, well separated from one another, were placed in drills of the tetraploid perennial ryegrass variety Reveille, the proportion of florets which formed caryopses, and of caryopses which germinated was as follows (Table 1). The data (Table 1) clearly indicate that a considerable proportion of the S.24 florets had been fertilized by 2n pollen and had formed caryopses, but most of these had proved to be defective. As noted in the previous studies, the frequency of triploid seedlings was low, thus suggesting incompatibility between the n and 2n gametes for the production of viable zygotes. Of the total progenies classed as tetraploids in the early seedling stage, 80% proved to be ryegrass x tall fescue F1 hybrids. These arose as a result of free crossing with © 1971 H.

Visitors adopt one of two basic positions while feeding. In the prone position the insect alights on the anterior petal and probes for nectar so that its dorsal surfaces contact the floral genitalia. The supine position may be adopted after alighting on the anterior petal when the insect rotates so that it is virtually standing on its head. While probing for nectar from this position it is the ventral surfaces which contact the floral genitalia. Bumblebees adopt either feeding position; many large solitary bee species almost invariably adopt the supine one while large hoverflies always feed from the prone position. The behaviour of short?tongued visitors tends to be highly individual with respect to contact with the floral genitalia and many body surfaces may be involved. The varying activities of insect?visitors while feeding result in the deposition of pollen at different locations on the integument. Consequently insect?borne pollen is presented to the stigma in various ways and there is a spectrum of pollination effects: medium and long?tongued nectar?seeking insects tend to be systematic cross?pollinators while short?tongued or pollengathering species tend to be chance cross? or self?pollinators. The cleaning behaviour of insect?visitors strongly influences pollination as it removes much integumental pollen. Two requirements of the pollen deposition mechanism are postulated: that pollen should be placed (a) in a position not occupied by foreign pollen and (b) in a position irregularly or inefficiently cleaned. There were no positions which were free of foreign pollen throughout the visitor?species. On the other hand, violet pollen was found to be concentrated at locations inaccessible to the cleaning mechanism. Systematic cross?pollination results from the visits of a variety of insects with proboscides over 5 mm long including bumblebees, honeybees, solitary bees, hoverflies and beeflies, therefore, the violet flower is not simply a bee flower as previously supposed. The widespread practice of generalizing on the role of insect?visitors in pollination is questioned and the error in labelling flowers according to the taxonomic position of their pollinators is pointed out; the greater relevance of the morphological and behavioural characteristics of the insect?visitors is emphasized. Differences in the floral genitalia of these Viola spp. may reflect a shift from allogamy to facultative autogamy which, in turn, may be a response to a paucity of pollinators at certain seasons. However, the diverse range of pollinators may maintain some out?crossing by the least efficient but more abundant short?tongued pollinators. The diversity of pollinators, therefore, provides a mechanism whereby a sexual system can simultaneously produce variation and invariance. The evolutionary versatility of a mating system incorporating this mechanism may have been partially responsible for the success of the genus Viola throughout the temperate regions of the world.

It is suggested that with highly inbred lines the stigmatic surface requires some form of scarification to improve the seed-set. Most lines showed no preference for cross or self-pollen, and there was no evidence of self-incompatibility. Bud and mature flower pollination gave an improved seed-set over tripping in all lines. One inbred line gave a high seed-set in all pollination treatments. Results from another line were consistent with a short period of ovule receptiveness. Using data obtained from three experiments, two self-pollination treatments were used to screen breeding lines for their suitability as components of synthetic varieties.

This relationship was described by an equation involving the limited work-range of an individual bee (12m), the dilution of donor pollen with increasing distance from the source (0.67m-1) and a scaling factor determining the general level of setting. It was assumed that donor pollen density was so low that multiple pollination could be ignored. Seed counts per fruit averaged 1.4 on windfalls, 2.3 on a random sample of picked fruit, and 5.2 on trees nearest the pollen donors. Fruits from heavily cropping orchards nearby with established pollen donors averaged between four and six seeds per fruit. © 1971 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84970554984

Pollen was treated directly with infrared or ultraviolet radiation, and indirectly with chemicals that were applied to the stigmas before pollination. The chemicals (boric acid, calcium nitrate, colchicine, cyclohexamide, gibberellic acid, glycine, and indole butyric acid) were each used at five concentrations. High dosage rates of most treatments inhibited pollen growth in styles that were genetically compatible, but none of the treatments had a specific effect on the self-incompatibility mechanism. The effects of growth of compatible or incompatible pollen tubes in a style on subsequent growth of both types of pollen tubes in the same style were studied in an experiment with 6 hr between pollinations. The passage of some compatible pollen tubes through the style did not influence either self- or cross-compatibility in the style after the second pollination. The passage of some self-incompatible tubes into the styles caused a slightly higher number of incompatible tubes to penetrate the style after the second pollination.

The gibberellin?like substances were low up to 7 days after pollination, but increased rapidly in the next two days attaining a peak on the 9th day after pollination. The amount then declined and remained low till the seeds matured. Since the peak of gibberellin?like activity coincided with (but did not precede) the time when the seeds attained their maximum size, it was concluded that it could not account for their growth. Instead, evidence was obtained to show that the peak may be correlated with the growth of the embryo and endosperm. Thin?layer chromatography revealed the presence of three active gibberellin?like factors at the 9th day after pollination. The chromatographic behavior of two of these active factors are similar to gibberellins A1 and A3.

These include stigmatic closure, swelling and loss of curvature of the column, wilting of the perianth, deformation of the calli, and anthocyanin production. Applications of relatively high concentrations of GA3 induce post?pollination effects which, except for anthocyanin production, are less intense than those brought about by auxin. Kinetin does not induce post?pollination phenomena, but in concentrations of 10 ?g and 100 ?g/flower causes slight stigmatic closure, and in some combinations with NAA it inhibits wilting. Stigmatic closure, loss of column curvature and changes in calli, all of them NAA induced, cannot be prevented by simultaneous applications of kinetin, GA3 or ABA. Some combinations of NAA and GA3 lowered anthocyanin content relative to separate treatments with either hormone. Flowers treated with GA3 plus kinetin wilted slightly in most cases, but columns did not swell and retained their curvature; calli did not develop colour and anthocyanin content was generally equal to that of flowers given only kinetin. GA3 and ABA when applied together brought on symtoms which were similar to those caused by ABA only but anthocyanin content was lower than in flowers treated with either hormone alone. This is also true for ABA?kinetin mixtures, but intensities of the effects are different and, with certain concentration ratios, stigmatic closure occurs. The phenomena are discussed relative to fruit?set, seed formation, anthocyanin production, senescence, orchid biology and the possible mode of action of each hormone.

Br., six groups of isogenic lines were developed which were ideally suited for investigating the properties of individual genes controlling a quantitative character. Each group consisted of four homozygous parents for two alleles at each of the two loci in a common genetic background. A complete 4 × 4 diallel cross was obtained in each group. Because of the identical genetic background each diallel set could be considered as a genetic system of two loci. The biochemical functions of the alleles at each locus modifying the structure of the anthocyanin molecule were known. The phenotypes of the nine possible genotypes were qualitatively distinguishable by their flower colour differences. A quantitative measure of the phenotypic value associated with a genotype is the concentration of anthocyanins in flower tissues. In these simplified genetic systems, the nine phenotypic values could be expressed in terms of nine biometrical quantities, eight of which are attributable to the genetic effects of the alleles at the two loci under consideration. An unique solution of the set of nine equations in nine unknowns provided direct estimates of the parameters specifying additive, dominance and epistatic effects. Thus the effects of individual genes in a well-defined genetic background could be estimated by the use of a simple additive genetic model. An extension of the model provided estimates of the genetic parameters in different years and genetic backgrounds. Dominance was found to be the most important type of gene action in the inheritance of anthocyanin content in the flower tissues of M. incana. There was considerable epistasis, but the effect was very unstable over years and genetic backgrounds. The relative magnitude of additive effect was most stable. Heterosis was observed and was found to be largely due to dominance and additive × dominance interactions. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250474578

Among them, the form 4x-4 was divided into three subtypes by the constitution of nucleolar constrictions. The plants tested were collected in various localities ranging from Tokyo to Okinawa, and the form 4x-5 was found in the most collected plants of O. japonicus, and the three subtypes of the form 4x-4 in those of O. ohwii. The behavior of the meiotic pairings was almost the same in both the forms 4x-5 and 4x-4.

The frequency of fertile good pollen grains was relatively high in both forms. Furthermore, the progenies obtained from a form 4x-5 of O. japonicus revealed a preponderance of mother type plants under open-pollination.

Sta, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","The degree of natural self-fertilization was estimated by the frequencies of chlorophyllous variants derived from open pollinated seeds in Japanese red pines, Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. The variants from each individuals in five variant groups are thought to be inherited with each single recessive gene after crossing experiment respectively. The variants are as follows: (1) Albino: White seedlings. Some of them have pinky hypocotyl. They are lethal (Photo. 1). (2) Yellow seedlings: Yellow to yellowish green seedlings. Under natural field conditions, most of them die within one year after germination. Survived seedlings. (from a tree, OK-16) have light green needles in summer, and they change color to golden yellow in winter. The seedlings show marked retardation in height growth. (3) Light green seedlings (LG): Cotyledons and hypocotyl are light green. The seedlings seem to be lethal in the field (Photo. 3). (4) Seedlings with white primary leaves (WPL): Cotyledons and hypocotyl are normal green, but primary leaves are white to yellowish white. Two to three months after germination, the white primary leaves develop into normal green. Height growth of the variants is inferior to the control (Photo. 2, 3). (5) Transient albino: Just after germination, the seedlings have purely pinky hypocotyl and yellowish white cotyledons. Soon, they recover to yellowish green, then to normal green. Out of 320 individuals investigated from 3 pine stands (cf. Table 1), 22 individuals (6.87%) are expected to be heterozygous for the recessive genes mentioned above, and the ratios of the heterozygous individuals for respective genes are as follows: albino-2.50%, LG-2.50%, WPL-1.25%, yellow seedlings-0.31 and transient albino-0.31%. As these ratios were estimated from pooled population of 3 stands with individually open pollinated seeds by, mostly, one trial in 1963, they might be lower estimated. Fifty six observed percentages of the chlorophyllous variants in each open pollinated progeny during 1961 and 1966 ranged to 0 to 6.0%. They showed a distribution with a mean of 0.97% and a standard deviation of 1.39%. As the most of the variants being homozygous for the recessive gene are lethal, the gene frequency (P), rate of self-fertilization (S) and frequency of the variants (F) under random mating in a population satisfy the following equation: F=1/4 + 1/2 P(1-S). Thus, S=2F-P/0.5-P. If P is sufficiently small to zero as in the cases of the yellow seedlings and the transient albino in this report, S may be estimated by S=4F. The degrees of natural self-fertilization for yellow seedlings and for the transient albino were estimated to be about 11% and 2% respectively. The maximum range of the degree of natural self-fertilization of these pines were 0 to 24%. Meanwhile, average degrees of the selfing are as follows: WPL-2.0%, albino-1.4% and LG-0.0%. Although the degrees of natural self-fertilization of pines in stands are variable by individuals and years owing to the gene frequency concerned, amount of flowers of both sexes, degree of self-compatibility etc., the average degree of the selfing seems to be less than 5%. © 1971, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

An interrelationship between certain climatologic factors, high airborne spore and pollen concentrations, and asthma admission rates was noted. Large asthma ""epidemics"" (above 40 asthma admissions per 24 hours) occurred almost exclusively from June through December and in greater magnitude during September, October, and November. High summer asthma admission rates were significantly associated with high ""total spore and pollen,"" ""basidiospore-like,"" and ""small spore"" rotoslide counts. Asthma ""epidemics"" occurring during the peak September and October local Ambrosia pollination season were not necessarily associated with sudden influxes of Ambrosia pollen, but there was a significant relationship between high daily asthma admission rates (above 20 daily asthma admissions) and 24 hour rotoslide Ambrosia counts during September and early October. Asthma ""epidemics"" of considerable magnitude occurred in late October and November immediately following the peak Ambrosia pollination season. High total and ""basidiospore-like"" rotoslide spore concentrations plus heavy deposits of amorphous chitinous material resembling plant debris were noted on slide samples during these episodes. We currently postulate that New Orleans epidemic asthma does not involve a point source chemical or particulate pollutant but rather results from sensitization of the local atopic population by diverse natural inhalant allergens acting in seasonal patterns. © 1971.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015111942

In one diallel, emergence was poor and the variations present were largely determined by maternal effects. In the other it was better and the largest variations were determined by inbreeding depression effects. In most cases maternal effects on emergence were negatively correlated with maternal effects on endosperm size, while inbreeding effects were associated with reductions in embryo size. Maternal interaction effects were of minor importance and were probably correlated with effects on the endocarp. The auxin treatments had variable consequences according to their effects on the seed tissues. It is concluded that the factors which determined seedling emergence would tend to maintain heterozygosity and should therefore be regarded as part of the breeding system.

There was no evidence that wild plants or cultivated wheat varieties supported high populations of this insect, the principal source of field infestation being stocks of stored maize. Ears from the previous crop ploughed in at time of cultivation and sowing rarely support S. zeamais long enough to allow cross-infestation of susceptible new crop ears. In a growing crop of the variety 'Kitale synthetic', 50-60 per cent of the ears were tightly enclosed by the sheath. The remainder had loose or open sheaths. In the same crop the numbers of infested grains and infested ears present immediately before harvest were estimated by placing ears in separate polythene bags just after harvest and recording daily the emergence of adults over a 5 week period. As a result it was estimated that 42 per cent of the tightly sheathed ears were infested, compared with 51 and 84 per cent respectively in the loosely and open sheathed ears. Assuming one insect per infested grain the number of infested grains for infested ears from all three categories combined was 10 per cent. The overall level for infested grains in all ears from the crop as a whole was 6 per cent. These data compare well with a field experiment in which two different pre-harvest infestation levels were measured, e.g. where the kernel damage shortly after harvest was less than 1 per cent it took 16 weeks to reach a level of 7 per cent, compared with an initial level of 3 per cent which reached 16 per cent after only 8 weeks. In a comparison of the susceptibility of six white dent maize varieties to pre-harvest infestation, Hybrid 622 proved far superior to the others in three important aspects. It had a low incidence of ears with open tips (27·5 per cent), a lower level of insect attack even when compared to another variety with a similar level of open tipped ears and a much lower moisture content at harvest. Field experiments indicated that S. zeamais would not develop in the kernel before harvest until the moisture content fell to below 60 per cent, which in Kitale district would be mid-September i.e. 3 months before harvest. As was appreciated many years ago, the most practical method of reducing pre-harvest attack is by preventing insect development in harvested grain. Lindane admixed with harvested ears from which the sheaths had been removed, killed emerging adults and achieved this. Unfortunately there are signs of resistance developing to this insecticide and alternative treatments are required. The admixture of an effective contact insecticide to prevent breeding after harvest, combined with careful cleaning and spraying of empty stores not later than pollination of the next field crop, and selection of maize varieties resistant to attack before and after harvest, appear to be the most effective way of reducing pre-harvest infestation. © 1971.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649155035

This was also confirmed by hand pollination of the clusters on unthinned limbs, where fruit set was much higher than on unthinned unpollinated limbs. Fruit density in Packham's was not reduced even by 80 per cent of fruit bud removal, and in Williams fruit density was significantly reduced at 60 or 40 per cent of fruit bud removal, in a heavy or intermediate flowering years, respectively, whereas in a poor flowering year, fruit density was not significantly reduced even by 80 per cent of bud removal.

A first series of treatments started at midday the third day after pollination, while a second series of treatments ended at midday the fifth day after pollination; the times of exposure, according to the exposure rates, were 48, 24, 12, 6, 3, 1/2 hr and 45 min. The radiobiological parameters considered showed that irradiation, during the last part of the zygote resting stage, induced the highest decrease of embryo development. The exposure rate effect is also more drastic during this second zygote resting period, and with the two highest exposure rates, all the proembryos died before the 13th day after pollination. The histological analyses showed many abnormalities during the first stages of the embryogenesis. The mean weight of 100 seeds, the mean number of seedlings per capsule, the mean number of germinated seeds and the cotyledon abnormalities showed the same abnormal behaviour as embryonic development. All the results show a variation of the radiosensitivity during the resting period of the zygote: in Nicotiana tabacum, the higher radiation sensitivity is in the G2 zygote stage as compared with the G1. The radiation damage induced by the higher exposure rates is greater than those induced by the lower rates. © 1971.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49649149614

The trend during the life?cycle is the same either in open pollinated progenies or in clonal lines. The IAA and ICA contents in various lines, determined in plants at the same stage, differ considerably from each other; this difference may have a genetic basis. The distribution in different parts of a single plant is a falling gradient in auxin concentration from the young to the mature tissues. By comparing root formation with free auxin concentration of stem cuttings, evidence is collected which suggests that IAA may have primary action in the regulation of root formation.

In hybrids between Mutant 10/13 and rye (Secale cereale 2n = 14), homoeologous chromosomes frequently pair at meiosis although normally, in wheat-rye hybrids, this happens infrequently. The association of the mutant condition with chromosome 5B was determined by (i) the absence of segregation in hybrids obtained when Mutant 10/13 monosomic 5B was pollinated by rye; (ii) the occurrence of trisomie segregation for pairing behaviour in 28-chromosome wheat-rye hybrids, obtained from SB trisomie wheat parents with two 5B chromosome from a non-mutant and one from a mutant parent; (iii) the absence of segregation for pairing behaviour in the 29-chromosome wheat-rye hybrids obtained from the same trisomie wheat parents. The alternative pairing behaviours segregated independently of the centromere when wheat plants that were simultaneously heteromorphic, 5BL telocentric/5B complete, and heterozygous for the Mutant 10/13 state, were pollinated by rye. The alternative chromosome-pairing patterns segregated to give a ratio not different from 1:1, so that the association of homoeologous pairing with Mutant 10/13 probably derived from the occurrence of mutation at a single locus on 5BL. In the disomic heteromorphic state, 5BL was 91 map units in length. Trisomie wheats with two complete 5B chromosomes and one 5BL telocentric, that were also heterozygous for the Mutant 10/13 condition, were pollinated by rye. Among the resulting 28-chromosome hybrids there was a 2:1 segregation of hybrids with low pairing: high (homoeologous) pairing and also of hybrids with complete 5B: telocentric 5BL. However, there was no evidence of linkage in this trisomie segregation. All the 29-chromosome hybrids from this cross had low pairing and it could be concluded that the single mutant allele, in Mutant 10/13, was recessive. In the trisomie condition, relative to a simplex situation, 5BL was 33·05 map units in length. The critical locus on 5BL was designated Pairing homoeologous. The normal dominant allele was symbolized Ph and the recessive allele, in Mutant 10/13, ph. The prevention of homoeologous pairing by the activity of a single locus makes the evolution of the regular meiotic behaviour of T. aestivum more readily comprehensible. © 1971, Cambridge University Press.

Pollen dilution reduced set but the reduction was not the same for all maternal parents. It also reduced the rate of fruit ripening, increased the proportion of pyrenes without seed content and reduced the tendency for abortive carpels to develop into small empty pyrenes. Observations of numbers of pollen grains germinating in the styles revealed differences attributable to the maternal parents, the pollen germinating poorest on the parent whose pyrene set was reduced most by pollen dilution. There were also maternal × paternal interaction effects on pollen germination. It is concluded that pollen germination was conditioned by growth substances provided partly by the grains themselves and partly by the styles of the seed parent, and that there were interactions between the two sources. Reduction in pollen concentration affected several aspects of early fruit development, but quantitative differences in the amount of pollen applied did not reduce the adverse effects of using diploid pollen. This suggests that such effects do not arise through direct action of the pollen on the maternal tissues. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981584210

Dent corn (open-pollinated variety), planted at 4 plant populations on the soils of 3 different fertility levels in 1967. The results are as follows. 1. Grain weight per LAI decreased as LAI increased and there was apparently a linear relationship between LAI and the logarithm of grain weight per LAI at each soil fertility level. The similar relationship was found between LAI and the logarithm of total dry matter weight per LAI in Tomorokoshi Ko No.7. From the relationships a method of estimating optimum LAI at silkingtime to maximize grain and total dry matter yield was developed. 2. The optimum LAIs for grain production estimated by the method were 2.32, 3.76 and 4.91 for Tomorokoshi Ko No.7, and 2.51, 4.63 and 5.10 for Yellow Dent corn, at low, medium and high soi1 fertility levels, respectively. The optimum LAIs for the total dry matter production of Tomorokoshi Ko No.7 were 4.88, 5.34 and 6.85 at low, medium and high fertility levels, respectively. These results showed that the optimum LAIs for grain and total dry matter production increased as the soil fertility increased. 3. The flat LAI-grain yield curve near the optimum LAI suggested that near-maximum grain yields would be obtained in a wide range of LAI near the optimum LAI. 4. Tomorokoshi Ko No.7 possess an inherent capacity to produce grain weight per leaf area much more than Yellow Dent corn. 5. The optimum LAIs were larger in total dry matter production than in grain production. Therefore, it was suggested that larger LAIs with higher plant populations have an advantage in total dry matter production for silage. © 1971, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

The transfer of immature embryos from maternal plants to artificial media influenced the radial arrangement of vascular bundles in developing root primordia. The variability in the number of poles of the prospective protoxylem and protophloem, observed as a rule during embryogenesis under natural conditions, could not be suppressed even under the conditions of in vitro cultivation. The possibility is admitted that when using agar medium the nutrient supply need not necessarily be equivalent for all embryos. 2. Using excised embryos of various ages the period of delimination of the vascular system in the root primordium was determined. It is relatively short and occurs in the first half of embryogenesis. The results obtained revealed no relationship between vascular system arrangement in root primordium and mature grain and mature embryo size. 3. Maize ear represents a type of inflorescence of which the apical part is delayed in development. Histogenically this uneven development becomes evident with the formation of a significantly lower mean number of poles in root primordia from the grains originating from the apical region of the cob. This is further evidence of the adaptibility of the vascular system development to environmental conditions. 4. As further causes of the variability in pole number those differences are considered which occur during sex cell formation, pollination and fertilization. © 1971 Institute of Experimental Botany.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52449144795

In a diallel made in 1964 interaction effects between pollen and the maternal effect considerably influenced the set of pyrenes, but maternal effects predominated in a diallel made in 1965. Application of auxin in the first diallel reduced the interaction effects. It is postulated that the set of large pyrenes was largely determined by the interaction of physiological effects contributed by the male and female parents, but that maternal effects were so strong in the second diallel that variations in those of the male parent were less important. These factors were probably concerned with the arrest of flower growth and its subsequent recommencement following pollination. Auxin apparently affected late acting factors associated with seed tissues, but these were relatively unimportant for pyrene set. Self pollination improved the set of pyrenes in the first diallel, perhaps because the conditions were similar to those under which the varieties were originally selected. Maternal parents differed in the rate at which their fruits ripened, but the pollen parent also influenced the rate of ripening. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell.

By means of bioassays it has been found that a relatively low content of auxins and a definite level of gibberellins and inhibitors are characteristic for normal rye spikes at the time of stamen differentiation. The higher level of auxins and expressive inhibitions occur in the later course of pistil differentiation. Two sprayings of plants with mixed solutions of MH and NAA and two further sprayings with a solution of NAA only before the stamen differentiation change slightly the natural character of endogenous regulators in spikes and cause the destruction of mother pollen cells in anthers and the sterility of anthers in the majority of rye florets. The anthers in the basis of spikes sometimes contain pollen grains after treatment, but their fertility is substantially lowered because the spray evidently disturbed the accumulation of reserve substances in pollen grains. The development of pistil was not affected by the exogenous application of growth regulators. Normal kernels arose in the majority of flowers after supplementary pollination. Some accidental effects of exogenous application of growth regulators, as for example reduced stem growth and disorder of lodicule function were lowered to a great extent by adding GAS to the last two sprayings of NAA. © 1970 Institute of Experimental Botany.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52449139994

The characters studied were those associated with seminal reproduction and included seed yield and several of its primary components. The pattern of variation between the parents indicated a mainly additive system, item a of the Hayman analysis being significant for yield and all the other characters. Maternal effects were not a constant feature, but were evident for seed yield, plant weight and spikelet numbers/inflorescence. Dominance was a prevalent feature and invariably acted in the direction of the greater expression of the character. While a high level of incompatibility was evident from the paucity of seed setting on selfing, the variation between progeny yields following open pollination gave a range from the highly acceptable levels of commercial production to very low uneconomic levels. The results indicate that improvement in seed yield is feasible by breeding even though in this variety selection pressure has tended towards a restriction of variability for essentially agronomic features. © 1970 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250480221

Armagh, United Kingdom","A series of experiments was conducted to determine the variations arising between replicate selfing units, to compare self-fertility and cross-fertility in the same environment and to measure the variation in expression of self-fertility by different techniques and in different environments. Variation in self-fertility between selfing units within genotypes was relatively high, representing approximately one-third of the total observed variation in a series of duplicate selfings of over 60 genotypes tested in one environment. In order to differentiate clearly between the self-fertility of a limited number of genotypes as many as four replicates were needed, although this number varied with the environment in which the tests were conducted. Levels of self-fertility were similar in bag selfing units placed inside or outside a glasshouse in an average year, but were greater outside than inside in a year which was drier and warmer than average. In a highly humid environment the mean level of self-fertility attained was reduced by a factor of three. Removal of flag leaf laminae had an adverse effect on self-fertility, reducing it by half. Shaking the pollination bags, as is the usual practice to promote pollen dispersal, increased self-fertility very considerably over that of unshaken controls. Assisting pollen dispersal by blowing filtered air into the bags was time-consuming and did not prove to be superior to the shaking technique. It is clear that self-fertility can neither be considered in isolation from the environment in which it is determined, nor can it justifiably be related to cross-fertility unless both are determined in the same environment. A sample of over 60 genotypes tested in one environment was on average 2.2% as self-fertile as they were cross-fertile, with a range for individual genotypes from 0-31%. Optimum conditions for maximum expression of self-fertility, essential in the exploitation of this character in ryegrass breeding, have yet to be fully established. © 1970 Kluwer Academic Publisher.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-6244226668

Floral and extrafloral exudates in orchids may also function as attractants for ants which probably feed on them and repel grazers. Copyright © 1970, Wiley Blackwell.

In nature, pocket?loading takes place in the nearly ripe fig at the male phase. Impregnated female wasps leave their galls, approach the ripe anthers, and load the pockets by very swift movements of the forelegs. Then they leave the fig via narrow channels bored by the males. Upon entering young receptive figs, the female wasps begin oviposition, during which pocket?emptying and pollination take place. The pollen pocket of Blastophaga quadraticeps is a complex and highly specialized structure rather than a mere depression or fold of the body wall. Each pocket is a small saccular organ with well?defined openings. The two marginal exits are very narrow. The third opening is the largest. It gaps widely when the adjacent sternite is touched parallel to the inner border of the pocket and closes shortly afterwards. Loading of the pocket is achieved by two separate actions, which follow each other: The legs transfer the pollen to the thorax and then the pollen is absorbed by some inherent mechanism of the pocket itself, through the wide entrance which opens at the touch of the legs. A technique for artificial loading with various materials (spores, iron particles, etc.) affords good means of studying the inner structure of the pocket. As yet no satisfactory explanation can be offered as to which forces are responsible for the opening of the pocket and the mechanism of pollen absorption. Copyright © 1970, Wiley Blackwell.

The three floral forms differ in style length, stamen length, pollen size, presence or absence of starch in the pollen and in stigma size. In the majority of natural populations examined, the three forms were represented in roughly equivalent numbers. The results of an artificial pollination programme demonstrate that the trimorphism is accompanied by physiological incompatibility, typical to tristylic plants. Self?pollinations were sterile. Intra?form and inter?form pollinations between anthers and stigmas at different levels were also sterile. The inhibition of pollen tubes occurs in the style. Inter?form pollinations between anthers and stigmas at equivalent level resulted in seed production, the most fertile form being the mid?styled one; these differences were lost in open?pollinated plots.

An attempt was made to correlate the pollen morphology with the taxonomy of the family. The pollen morphological data provide clear support in favour of the division of the family into two separate families, respectively, Haloragaceae and Gunneraceae. Both subfamilies, i.e., Haloragoideae Schindl. (excluding a few spccies in the subsection Spongiocarpus Schindl.) and Gunneroideae Schindl., are stenopalynous. Important arguments concerning pollen morphology, gross morphology, ecology, and type of pollination, favour a regroupment of the Haloragis species belonging to the subsection Spongiocarpus, which is related to the genus Landonia Lindl. Eventual fusion of these Haloragis species in the subsection Spongiocarpus with the genus Loudonia is worth consideration. The Haloragaceae is an interesting plant group from a palaeobotanical point of view. A review of the literature concerning fossil findings of the Haloragaceae and sporo- morphs of the Stemma Normapollcs Pf., some of which most probably could have been related with the Haloragaceae, point out the interest of this family to palaeo- botany.

Computer simulation techniques were used to investigate the population genetics of the zone of contact between interbreeding plant subspecies, in particular to test the hypothesis that where interbreeding leads to hybrids of low fertility (which involves wastage of the gametes concerned in hybridisation), then any genes tending to prevent interbreeding should have a selective advantage and should increase in frequency with a consequent increase in genetic isolation of the subspecies and a decrease in gene flow between them. 2. Two basic experiments were devised, using flowering period as the potential isolating mechanism. In a situation in which hybrids had a fertility of only 25 per cent, of that of the parent subspecies, both of the latter were given equal possibility of genetic variability in date of flowering and length of the flowering period. 3. In a preliminary experiment, the two subspecies were thoroughly intermingled and pollination took place entirely at random through the whole population. At the beginning, the two subspecies flowered simultaneously identity. But within about 60 generations one subspecies had become lateflowering and the other early-flowering, and both had shortened the length of their flowering periods; there was very little overlap in flowering and consequently there was very little hybridisation; both subspecies had largely regained their identity, and were effectively isolated genetically from one another.4. In a more complex experiment, the subspecies were in contact but not intermingled, and there was a restriction on the distance of pollen and seed movement. Initially, flowering was not quite simultaneous. 5. In the early stages, hybridisation occurred in the region of contact and furthest in the number of hybrids in spite of this much greater intermingling, and there was only slight interpenetration of the two subspecies; hybridisation is a powerful factor in hindering interpenetration. Evolution of flowering time difference occurred as it had done in the first experiment, but much more slowly Until such a difference began clearly to appear, the zone of interpenetration of the subspecies (which never lost their identity) remained narrow, but as the difference developed (most strongly in the plants furthest into the territory of the other subspecies) this zone increased in size and eventually there was very considerable intermingling of the subspecies which became virtually sympatric At the same time there was no increase in the number of hybrids in spite of this much greater intermingling, and this was clearly due to the fact that as a result of selection there had come to be little overlap in flowering period between the subspecies within the zone of interpenetration, and they were now good genetically isolated species. 6. Change in flowering period was not confined to the zone of interpenetration, but the alleles involved flowed outwards into areas well away from it. This was confirmed in an experiment which kept the zone narrow by introducing ecological preferences; at the ends of the population, where the subspecies were widely separated from each other and hybridisation was geographically impossible, there came to be a difference of five weeks between their times of maximum flowering. © 1970 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966168196

These include: 1. In Western Australia, the species occurs in small, isolated populations between which migration and gene exchange must be limited, though obviously possible. 2. Primitive cross-pollination has been replaced by autogamy, although a residual capacity for crossing obtains. 3. The individual populations are relatively homozygous for different gene arrays so that interpopulational hybrids may exhibit heterosis.4. The species is cytologically pre-adapted to make use of interchange in that distal localisation and terminalisation of chiasmata is pronounced. 5. Interchange heterozygotes occur in virtually all populations of petraea and of the related species axillaris and anaethfolia, and interchange constitutes a longstanding component in their genetic systems. 6. Interchange points are randomly distributed along the chromosomes. 7. The three species possess a common and primitive chromosome end sequence which has not been replaced to any significant degree by any other arrangement in the homozygous condition. 8. Complex hybridity has evolved in the southwestern corner of the species range, by a process of sequential fixation of interchanges, in the heterozygous condition, upon the primitive chromosome end sequence. 9. Meiosis in the complex hybrids is highly irregular, the large rings exhibiting non-disjunction in some 80 per cent, of PMCs, and comparable behaviour occurs in the EMCs. 10. Two-ring complex heterozygotes occur in which the rings exhibit genetic interdependence. It is suggested that in such hybrids, spreading the complexes over two rings results in enhanced fertility through greater meiotic regularity. 11. Instability in one complex hybrid population has been shown to be dependent upon the existence of differential segments and of frequent crossing-over therein. Synthetic interpopulational hybrids frequently exhibit cytological configurations interpretable as resulting from crossing-over in differential segments. 12. The association of lethals with chromosome end arrangements in the complexes is not always as would be expected. The same lethal may or may not be associated with complexes of comparable interchange constitution. 13. The efficiency of the lethal system is positively correlated with ring size. A model is presented which suggests that, providing chance associates a requisite sequence of interchanges together in a heterotic individual, the action of the genetic system and chance will inevitably bring about the evolution of ?14 complex heterozygotes via a sequence of intermediate types comparable to those which have been described in the species. © 1970, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

The mitotic division of pollen grains occurred at the end of pollen growth. It was observed during the period from mid October to mid December. By late December almost all pollen grains finished the mitotic division. In mature pollen grains after the mitotic division, a reproductive cell and a pollen tube cell were recognized. The number of days required from the pollen formation to the pollen grain division was about 30 days. There was some difference in the course of pollen growth and the time of pollen grain division among individual trees. 2) Pollen grains began to germinate about 10 days after the mitotic division. The first pollen germination was observed in late October. The germination percentage increased rapidly in November and gradually in December, and in January it came to much the same percentage as at the time of dispersion. A similar tendency was also recognized in the elongation of pollen tube. Although the elongation of pollen tube was weak in the early period of pollen germination, it became better in and after January. The number of days required from the pollen formation to the acquirement of germinability was about 40 days. The course of pollen germination and tube elongation, germination percentage, and pollen tube length differed pretty much according to individual trees. It has been definitely shown by this experiment that the pollen grains of Cryptomeria japonica have acquired much the same germinative capacity as the mature pollen grains already about two months before natural dispersion. Therefore, it seems that it is possible to extract pollen before the natural dispersion for artificial pollination. © 1970, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

Flowers were pollinated with a mixture of small amounts of pollen from the pollinated florets' one?day circle (i.e., a whorl in the head comprising all the florets opening during one day) and large amounts of pollen from a single floret of Jerusalem artichoke, or girasole (Helianthus tuberosus L.). The artichoke pollen, but not the sunflower pollen, was labelled with P?32. In another experiment the labelled artichoke pollen was replaced by labelled pollen from another sunflower plant. The activity per pollen grain, as well as the activity per ovule, was determined by means of a Geiger?Müller counter. Main results: (1) When the sunflower's pollen tubes reach the ovule and double fertilization is effected by the plant's own sperm cells, the ovule also usually receives one or several pairs of sperm cells from the artichoke. (2) Each ovule in a one?day circle often receives the same number of sperm cells. (3) After pollination with labelled artichoke pollen from one floret, an activity corresponding to 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 pollen grains per ovule was obtained. After pollination with active foreign sunflower pollen from one floret, the corresponding number was 2, 3, 5, 9 or 17. Besides the pair of sperm cells effecting double fertilization, the number of pairs received by an embryo sac thus corresponds to one of the members in the 2n series, with n representing the integer series from zero upwards. The highest n value found is 4. (4) When pollen from the same father is used, the number of sperm cells entering the embryo sac varies between the one?day circles. Thus, variation occurs among isogenic whorls of florets. An autoradiographic method was used to follow the localization after fertilization of the compounds containing the isotope. Literature on polyspermy in the Angiosperms is reviewed. The following general conclusions could be drawn: (1) Polyspermy is a widespread phenomenon among cross?fertilizing Angiosperms. (2) Polyspermy does not seem to occur among self?pollinating species. (3) When a large number of nuclei are involved, it is improbable that the number of pollen tubes reaching the embryo sac corresponds to the number of pairs of sperm nuclei entering the embryo sac. Hence, pollen tubes may sometimes empty their contents into other pollen tubes. 1970 Hereditas",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85005623189

The bees are attracted by floral fragrances, and the chemical composition of the fragrances determines which species are attracted. The male bees collect the fragrance materials directly from the flower by rubbing the surface of the flower with special tarsal brushes. The bees launch into flight, transfer the fragrance materials, and store them in swollen glandular tibiae of the rear legs. The contents of the tibiae after floral visits were analyzed by gas chromatography; they were the same as the floral fragrance. Approximately 50 compounds are present in euglossine orchid fragrances, and some species may produce as many as 18 of the compounds. Other species produce fewer compounds. Certain of the compounds, when presented to the bees in tropical America, proved to attract many species of euglossine bees. Other compounds attracted only a few species although in some cases no bees were attracted. Combinations of the compounds attracted markedly fewer species than pure compounds. Appropriate combinations of compounds, in the proportions found in orchid fragrances, attract the same bees which are attracted by the flowers.

There was a definite relationship between the type of incompatibility and the site of inhibition: in interspecific incompatibility the inhibition occurred in the stigma, in intraspecific incompatibility it occurred in the style. An hypothesis of the S-gene evolution explaining intra-and interspecific incompatibility, and having the following salient features, is proposed: (1) There are two kinds of specificity, each governed by a separate complex of genetic elements, involved in the incompatibility reaction-a primary specificity controlling interspecific incompatibility and a secondary specificity controlling intraspecific incompatibility. (2) The primary specificity developed early during the evolution of gymnosperms, as a means of avoiding indiscriminate fertilization by anemophilous pollen, thus combating, (i) chiefly, the sterilization of their ""naked"" ovules through pollination by relatively distant species; and (ii) less significantly, the relatively easy introgression from closely related species. The primary specificity complex evolved, through duplication and redifferentiation, initially from a single specificity cistron. (3) The secondary specificity developed early during the evolution of angiosperms, as a means of excluding self-fertilization. It arose through a duplication of the entire set (or a major portion) of primary specificity cistrons. Redifferentiation of the duplicate complex produced a large number of alleles controlling intraspecific incompatibility. Self-compatibility alleles and polymorphism of the S-gene are explained in terms of mutations and subsequent natural selection favouring different forms of the S-gene complex. The interspecific incompatibility patterns reflect the differences in the architecture of the S genes of the parents. The parallel, supposedly independent, evolution of the gene complexes controlling breeding behaviour in widely different phyla of the plant kingdom has been cited as an example of ""channelling"" in evolution. It is suggested that the rise of a primeval, specificity element in the nucleus, early in the evolution of plants, produced, through duplication and redifferentiation, an easy means for the evolution of diverse sexual mechanisms in plants. © 1969 Martinus Nijhoff.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000013333

In root sections exposed to IAA this timing apparently is due to the fact that the rate of ethylene production reflects the internal IAA content; the latter increases initially after auxin is applied but rapidly decreases again due to induction or activation of the enzyme systems conjugating and destroying IAA. A similar mechanism may be involved in the induction of ethylene production in fruits. In vivo ethylene is derived from methionine, possibly after the amino acid is activated to form S-adenosyl methionine, by decarboxylation of C1, transfer of C2 possibly as a folic acid derivative, formation of ethylene from C3-C4, and transfer of the S-methyl to a suitable receptor molecule. Analogue studies indicate that ethylene attaches (KA=6×10-10M) to a metal containing receptor by one end through a non-covalent bond. This attachment is competitively inhibited by CO2 (KI=4.9×10-4M) thus explaining the ability of this gas to antagonize most biological responses to ethylene, including fruit ripening. CO2 does not inhibit ethylene production, but may influence fruit ripening and induce certain physiological disorders by binding to metal containing enzymes such as catalase. Ethylene production is inhibited at low O2 concentrations; the receptor has an O2 affinity closely similar to that of cytochrome oxidase. In addition O2 is required for ethylene action, and the kinetics best describing the situation are those in which O2 binds to the receptor (KS=4×10-5M) or indirectly oxidizes it before ethylene can attach. This effect of low pO2 is not dependent upon a respiratory inhibition for it occurs at O2 concentrations which are not low enough to inhibit respiration and cannot be duplicated by respiratory poisons. Thus low concentrations of O2 retard fruit ripening both by inhibiting ethylene production and action. The rate of gas exchange and hence the internal concentration of ethylene within a fruit depends upon the diffusion coefficient of ethylene in air. As this is a function of atmospheric pressure, storing fruits at a subatmospheric pressure reduces their ethylene content. In addition this condition automatically decreases the O2 partial pressure thus greatly extending the storage life of preclimacteric fruits. © 1969 Dr. W. Junk N.

Although other authors have recognized as few as one species of Jepsonia, various lines of evidence suggest that three allopatric species can be recognized, which are morphologically distinct and separated from each other by barriers to hybridization. These species are J. heterandra of the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, J. malvifolia of southern California's offshore islands and the Mexican Guadalupe Island, and J. parryi of mainland southern California and adjacent Baja California. Plants flower from late summer to early winter in response to environmental factors that have yet to be clearly identified. Flowers are heterostylous, and the species are self-incompatible. Pollination is by syrphid flies and halictid bees. Leaves are produced during or after flowering in response to rain. They persist through the winter until the onset of the dry season in the subsequent late spring. Plants perennate by a starchy underground structure, which is hypocotylar in origin and best termed a caudex. Young plants and many old ones also produce one or more very large, whitish, starch-free contractile roots that are annual in duration. Jepsonia heterandra characteristically is restricted to the crevices of slatelike rocks, although the other two species occur in a wider range of edaphic situations. Moisture and temperature conditions, as well as rodent predations, may determine the general and local distribution of the species.

One explanation for this is that a single 24-chromosome restitution sperm nucleus fuses with the central cell of the megagametophyte. This suggests that a superior pollinator may be one that produces a high frequency of restitution sperm nuclei. To test this, a technique was developed for observing pollen tube mitosis in vitro following germination of potato pollen in a 20% lactose-50 ppm boric acid solution. A single 24-chromosome restitution sperm nucleus was found in up to 38% of the pollen tubes from a superior pollinator. Moreover, pollen from an inferior pollinator soaked in a sucrose-boric acid-colchicine solution produced 100% restitution sperm nuclei in vitro and a haploid frequency from a tetraploid cultivar comparable to that normally induced by an untreated superior pollinator. The data indicate that the effectiveness of a pollinator in inducing haploids in potato is determined by the frequency of restitution sperm nuclei it produces. © 1969 H.

The dominant response was due to soil management; straw mulch was better than cultivation, and cultivation was equal to clover sward in yield, but was inferior in vigour. Cross pollination improved yield, and tended to depress growth for both straw mulch and clover sward plots, but had little or no effect in cultivation. The various nitrogen treatments produced no important differences except that unfertilized trees declined in growth though not in yield, and the growth decline was slower than expected. After the fertilizer trials were concluded, the clover sward treatment was lifted in production to almost equal straw mulch.

Sta., Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","In 1965 and 1967, self- and cross-pollination was made on Iwao-sugi which is believed to be a single clone of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don, using other cultivars as pollinater. Cone and seed production, germination of the seeds, and frequency of chlorophyllous variant seedlings detected are shown in Tables 1 and 2. By careful treatment of mother trees, full seed yields (mg) per cone, 1000-seed-weight, and germination percentage of the seeds were much improved in the crosses in 1967 than those in the previous crossings. There was large variation in germination percentage among the families of different pollinaters ranging from 20.9 to 48.5 percent. In the field trial, about 20 percent germination was scored for the selfed seeds, but in the greenhouse trial, 29 percent germination was obtained indicating that seeds of inherent weaker quality failed to germinate in the field trial. Seedlings showing chlorophyllous anomalies, as shown in Photo 1, were detected with the rate of 2.6~4.6 percent in the self-pollinated seedlings. Even in the cross-pollinated seedlings a few anomalous seedlings were found. At present, their genetical nature is not clarified. In the self-pollinated seedlings, another type of chlorophyllous change was noted. Namely, they showed summer-whitening (white to yellowish white) of needles and twigs. This type of anomaly showed a strong resemblance to a cultivar, Ninjinba (=Ninzinba), on its summer-yellowing as reported by Tsukahara (1964). The variant was named as Ninzinba-type seedlings by us, and was proved to be controlled with a recessive gene (Photo 2 and Table 3). Height of two-year-old seedlings was measured of each family of 1965 crossings and the results are presented in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The average heights of seedlings differed largely depending on each pollen parent, and the heritability of the height was estimated to be 0.56. As seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the patterns of frequency distribution of heights of self-and cross-pollinated seedlings were somewhat different. In the seedlings of normal- and Ninzinba-types derived from selfing of Iwao-sugi, histograms showed the left-side skewness with increased variance. On the other hand, in the cross-pollinated seedlings, histograms showed almost symmetrical distribution. Relation between average seedling height, and variance and variation coefficient is shown in Fig. 3. The variation coefficient of the selfpollinated seedlings are about 50 percent higher than those of cross-pollinated ones. The lower figures of the variation coefficients of the cross-pollinated seedlings may be explained by a hybrid buffer with multiple alleles. Although Iwao-sugi shows very fast growth, it seems to have a high heterozygosity. It is possible to obtain individuals which have accumulated effective genes for the growth by self-pollination of Iwao-sugi. © 1969, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

Just as in genetics the abstract species has been replaced by the population, the functional contacts between animals and plants should not be considered on the species level but in relation to the whole local ecosystem. Incidental cross?links therein are described as leading to concurrent evolution as a corollary. Inside the rain forest homeostasis is provided in the vegetative sphere by pest?pressure, all?year germination and accidental replacement, but it is especially strong in the reproductive sphere, by mutual collaboration in time, this via a feedback by means of internal, permanent animal life. These circumstances explain the lack of vicariance and the polymorphy, maintaining nevertheless normal interspecific selection. A comparison with seeds, seedlings, flowers, etc., from temperate vegetation is illustrative. There, abiotic factors, edaphic and climatic, are dominant and the whole is more open to external influences. Their anemochory (wind dispersal) and autochory (self dispersal) prove to be not fundamental for plant?life. In the tropics archaic dispersal methods (by fish and reptiles) of archaic, juicy, large seeds (sarcotesta) persist in a conservative, homeostatic environment alongside modern methods. Both lead to typically tropical traits and may serve to explain phylogenetic trends. These are discussed for Leguminosae. The aril is a compromise suited for dryer regions, but maintaining archaic attractivity of the seednot yet the pericarp?fruit. Bat?fruits provide a typical modern touch. Archaic pollination?methods (for example by beetles and simple flies) are bound to the ecosystem as a whole, which provides subsistence. Deceptive cross?links (short?circuits) are here more important than food for such unadapted visitors. The flowers probe instincts chemically. Some flowers provide a brood?place, as in Ficus, which breeds its own wasps in an ancient relationship, allowing Ficus to escape from the forest. Monophily (deceptive or not) is not necessarily late. The bond with other hymenopterans (wasps) arose also as an incidental cross?connection. Later this developed into a fixed relationship with flower?insects. Orchids as active ecological parasites demonstrate the exploitation of pre?existing animal life. The more modern impact of birds and bats is described in a synecological context, which makes some parts of syndromes understandable. Case?histories are given to illustrate the interaction between dispersal and pollination, between functions and structures in seed (fruit) and flowers. We see their clashes and the solution, always found, leading to permanently necessary changes. Dispersal may be anticipated in apparently functionless (or supposedly phylogenetical) floral characters. Points from a pollination?syndrome may form preadaptations for a dispersal?syndrome and vice versa. The calyces of oriental Trifolium species illustrate monospermy, and their capitula the possible origin of these characters and the inferior ovary in the Compositae.

Percentage of full seeds was 90.1% and 95.3% in the control and in open pollination. On the other hand, it decreased to 48.5% and 11.1% by the gamma ray exposures of 3.9 × 103 and 7.8 × l03R. One thousand-seed-weight was not affected by the exposure. As shown in Fig. 1, number of full seeds per cone seems to be reduced to zero at the exposure of about 8 × l03~9 × l03R in the crosses in both places. Fifty per cent reduction dose for number of full seeds per cone was estimated to be 5 × lO3R. Total seed number per cone was slightly reduced in the exposure range of zero and 7.8 × lO3R, and, at 11.7 × l03R, even number of empty seeds was reduced. Germination percentage of the full seeds was very high in all exposure plots showing mean values of 97.5%, 99.2%, 93.3% and 93.3% for respective exposures of the pollen in the crosses at the Institute of Radiation Breeding. For the crosses at the Tohoku Forest Tree Improvement Station, mean germination percentages of the full seeds were 97.1% and 97.5% for the control and 3.9 × lO3R plot, respectively. Frequency of chromosomal aberration (bridge) in root tips was in the range of zero~ 0.9% in the control and irradiated plots showing insignificant increase of the aberration. © 1969, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

Results show that the genus is a group of closely related but well-defined species. The occurrence of F1 interspecific hybrids is strongly suggested from field observations and glasshouse plantings but because of sterility in the F1 generation hybridization between species apparently plays little part in continuing evolution. Species distributions are closely correlated with the occurrence of cracking clay soils and show large discontinuities. Although Astrebla pectinata, A. elymoides, and A. squarrosa are common on the Barkly Tableland A. lappacea is generally absent from that area. Internal and epidermal leaf anatomy indicates that Astrebla is related to the chloridoid line of grasses. Prevention of cross-pollination showed that all species are highly self-compatible.

To force flowering, gibberellin solution of 200 ppm was sprayed on trees in July 1964. For acute irradiation, the pollen was collected from cut-branches with mature male strobili, and exposures of 1.0 × 103, 2.0 × 103, 3.4 × 103 and 5.9 × l03 were delivered by 20 hour-irradiation. Chronically irradiated pollen was collected from cut-branches with male strobili of Kumotoosi that had been grown in the gamma field since 1962. Chronic exposure rates per day (20 h) were 1.54, 5.02, 7.33 and 10.0R on October 1, 1964.

No stimulative effect of irradiated pollen was noted on seed production, germination and height growth of one- and two-year-old seedlings. In acute irradiation, LD100 for seed germination was estimated to be 7 × 103 and exposure that will result 50 per cent reduction of germination was 3~4 × l03. Under chronic irradiation, lethal daily exposure for sugi was about 10R, while germination percentage of the seeds pollinated with the chronically irradiated pollen at 10 R/day was reduced to one third of the control. By comparison of seed germination percentage between acute and chronic irradiation, equivalently effective acute exposures for chronic pollen irradiation were estimated to be 1.7 × 103 R-5.02R/day, 2.7 × 103 R-7.33 R/day and 4.8 × 103 R-10.0 R/day respectively.

Extinction and subsequent disjunction of range is a rather common phenomenon, the reasons for which are obscure. Tropical rain?forest groups have carried important potentialities and this has led to the development from these ancestral groups towards many specialized microtherm offshoots peopling the colder parts of the globe. This has sometimes also led to north?south bi?hemis?pherical different counterpart families, affinities, or lineages. Evolution among tropical plants has worked in an erratic way and there is an astonishing variation in the rate of potentialities. This cannot be correlated with degree of versatility in adaptation. The generous tropical rain?forest conditions offer the lowest possible survival?value level to plant development, i.e. the lowest competition intensity. For plants of the undergrowth there may be a minor limitation set by pollination deficiency. There are roughly three main kinds of species in the tropical rain forest, (i) the coenospecies, with a variant the complex species, (ii) the reticulately allied species forming solid blocks, and (iii) the isolated species of genera of remote alliance. The coenospecies and complex species came into being through development by a very gradual process of differentiation by small changes during a long period of dispersion. They have probably not led to the origin of the solid blocks of which the species are often sympatric. Both categories belong to micro?evolutionary change, but did not contribute to macro?evolution. The tropical rain forest harbours an unusually large number of isolated species and an impressive number of unusual structures. Many of these are taxonomic parallels of terata and all can be derived from growth phenomena. Similar abnormal phenotypes, with considerable change in high?ranking structures, may be caused by sudden genetic changes, often single gene mutations. Also synthesogenic changes are sudden steps (amphi? and aneuploids). The low survival level of the tropical rain forest has offered the best opportunities for the survival, preservation, and further development of such saltatory evolution. Terata can be arranged in a few main groups according to growth phenomena and there is a striking parallel between terata and taxonomical monstrosities. From this correlation it appears plausible that the hopeful monsters have been an, or may be even the most, important means of macro?evolution by single large steps. With the length of geological time and the infinite numbers of individual tropical plants, an infinitesimally small number of nature's experiments succeeding could well have led to attaining new supraspecific structural levels by saltation. After all the number of structural plans is definitely restricted. Data on hybridization are hitherto scarce and polyploids are scant in the ligneous families; both impressions may be premature through lack of sufficient research. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

A project has been initiated to explore the possibilities of selection for higher levels of sucrose storage in the wild species S. spontaneum, using a representative sample of parental clones under conditions of natural crossing. 2. The aim of the programme is the development of superior clones to represent the wild species in conventional breeding programmes, which involve repeated backcrossing to S. officinarum. 3. An analysis of the first generation following the intercrossing of 21 parental types without emasculation, has demonstrated extensive genetic variability within and between progeny groups for fibre, sucrose, reducing sugars and yield grade. 4. Fibre and sucrose percent fresh weight are characters of high repeatability (0.4-0.6), and show little evidence of non-additive genetic effects. Individual plant performance for these characters can therefore be taken as a satisfactory basis for selection in this material. 5. The average degree of self-fertilization occurring under conditions of natural crossing has been estimated to be 0.69±.13, based on analyses of the quantitative genetic data for fibre and sucrose percent fresh weight. 6. The within-family genetic variance observed is of the order of five times that expected if the parental clones were homozygous. Much of the genetic variability induced within-families is therefore due to self-fertilization of heterozygous parental material, though the exact proportion cannot be deduced from the present data. 7. The initial response to selection for increased sucrose percent fresh weight is predicted to be of the order of 50% of the population mean. Comparable responses in subsequent cycles of the programme appear to be possible, provided an adequate degree of outcrossing can be achieved by controlled pollination techniques. 8. The genetic correlations between sucrose and other characters of importance are favourable to the objectives of the breeder, or else of a low order. There is no general relationship between the somatic chromosome number of the parental clones and the mean sucrose level of their progeny. © 1969 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250486481

Fedorov (1966) has recently summarized traditional notions on the subject and provided a new interpretation. The present paper discusses Fedorov's views and endeavours to show that our present knowledge of rain?forest ecology does not necessitate formulation of modes of speciation essentially different from those within other terrestrial plant ecosystems. After a discussion of the implications of genetic drift in the light of present knowledge, evidence is presented that tropical tree taxa, as exemplified by the species?rich south?east Asian Dipterocarpaceae, possess the following characteristics: Highly specialized adaptation to their biotic and physical environment, whether or not a single niche may be filled by one of several species in part by historical accident. Limited efficiency of fruit dispersal imposing contagious distribution of individuals within their habitats and inability to cross all but the narrowest dispersal barriers. An unspecialized pollination system in which autogamy is usual, but outcrossing between individuals of a clump, and to a lesser but significant extent between clumps of a population, frequent enough to allow gene exchange throughout populations in a continuous habitat. Allopatric differentiation between populations in response to differential selection pressures. Rarity of fertile hybrid populations; hydridization is often prevented owing to differentials in flowering time. Great morphological constancy even within taxa with a widespread but disjunct distribution; rarity of clinal variation. Long life?cycles combined with low numbers, but high numerical constancy, of chromosomes. The complexity of the rain forest can be explained in terms of: The seasonal and geological stability of the climate which had led to selection for mutual avoidance, and, through increased specialization, to increasingly narrow ecological amplitudes, leading to complex integrated ecosystems of high productive efficiency. As the complexity increases, the numbers of biotic niches into which evolution can take place increase but become increasingly narrow. Their great age. It is concluded that decreasing ecological amplitude has been accompanied by a reduction in the gene pool of constituent species, explaining their morphological uniformity and exceptional stability. The initial, fundamental, and apparently non?adaptive, diversity by which the many rain?forest tree families are characterized could have arisen when the early angiosperms invaded and diversified, presumably allopatrically, in what was to them a vacant humid tropical environment occupied by gymnospermous forest; diversification on this scale has become increasingly rare as the ecosystem evolved, and has subsequently occurred only, as in the case of the dipterocarps, when a group invades an extensive ecological niche previously not or little exploited.

By contrast, large insects accounted for a greater proportion of the population on blossom. The reasons for this are discussed. On apple blossom Syrphidae and honeybees were the insects most often seen, and on pear blossom Bibionidae and Mycetophilidae. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

The flowers are very complicated morphologically and many changes in the floral organs occur during anthesis. Differences in the flowering periods of the three species were found but comparisons of the length of flower life, the pollen and nectar presentation and the receptivity of the stigmatic surfaces showed few differences between species. Movements of the pedicel and corolla directly affect the outline and colour patterns presented by the flower and these are probably of prime importance in the attraction of insect visitors to these species. All the movements of the floral organs and the changes which they undergo together suggest that anthesis has two distinct phases. The first is characterized by the retention of pollen within the androecium and the second is characterized by the gradual displacement of pollen from the anthers to the petals. Pollination during the flrst phase is effected only by a few insect species which operate the pollination mechanism precisely. By contrast, pollination during the second phase may be effected by a wide variety of insect visitors and is not, therefore, entirely dependent upon the activities of a small number of highly adapted species, as previously supposed. This may be of critial importance to the many species of Viola which are predominantly in?breeders. In the absence of highly adapted pollinators (which is frequently the case), the second phase of anthesis may be the only opportunity for out?breeding. The frequency of pollen exchange in the three species is, therefore, partially dependent upon the change in the mode of pollen presentation during anthesis. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

The probability that this introgression is the result of long-range pollination appears remote. Presumably these two species hybridized during a period of past sympatric association. Further indication of past sympatry in the Black Hills is the presence of a common species of obligate parasite, i.e., wasp (Cynips insulensis) on Q. gambelii in the Rocky Mountains and on Q. macrocarpa of the Black Hills. The hybrid oaks in New Mexico probably reflect a westward migration of Q. macrocarpa during pluvial periods of the Pleistocene. Quercus gambelii most likely reached the Black Hills during the warmer postglacial hypsithermal era.

Whereas irradiation at dose-rates higher than 7.50 rad per hour seriously inhibited bud formation and floral development, chronic exposure at dose-rates ranging from 3 to 7 rad/hour increased the number of seeds per plant. This stimulation is not due to a higher number of seeds per fruit but to a very significant rise in the number of fruits per plant. As irradiation treatment did not significantly increase the number of flowers per plant and did not appear to stimulate pollen tube germination in the styles, it is concluded that the recorded increase in fruit-setting essentially resulted from a radio-induced inhibition of the processes which control floral abscission in the absence of cross-pollination.

Within the dicotyledons, there is a high incidence of alkaloid occurrence in the morphologically primitive Magnoliales-Ranales complex and related groups, a lower incidence in various phylogenetically intermediate groups and a progression of high incidence in all of the phylogenetically advanced but unrelated groups. Notably, the generally wind-pollinated ""amentiferous"" families, as well as the wholly aquatic families, are either alkaloid-absent or show very low incidence. High incidence of alkaloid occurrence appears as a general character, for some families or orders. In some families, such as Ranunculaceae, Berberidaceae, Menispermaceae, Piperaceae, Cactaceae, Papaveraceae, and Gentianaceae, alkaloids occur in over 90% of the species tested. In many others, there is also a high, though less pronounced, percentage. On the other hand, in certain families such as Fagaceae, Betulacae, Casuarinaceae, and Juglandaceae the alkaloid occurrence is almost zero. Thus, the occurrence of alkaloids can be treated as a general family characteristic. At the ordinal level, high or low incidence may appear uniformly in all component families of a single order or sometimes pronouncedly in one of the component families. As a general characteristic, incidence of alkaloid occurrence appears to be a useful one for phylogenetic analysis at the family or order levels. Even though, with the limited amount of data available, it is futile to speculate on the significance of alkaloid incidence among the dicotyledons (other than to point out the seemingly definite pattern of correlation with the phylogenetic scale), it may be worthwhile to point out the notable absence or near absence of alkaloids among the ""amentiferous"" families (which are windpollinated). Further research along the lines correlating pollination and specific pollinators with distribution and structure of alkaloids, together with the morphology, taxonomy and phylogeny of the flowering plants, will be most desirable and may yield interesting results. © 1968 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038988254

This report is part of a study concerned with their use. as hybrids with species, in gene transfer through diploid-tetraploid hybridization. Such hybridization has been shown to be quite easily accomplished. In this paper, the ploidy level of the progeny of 4x × 2x and 2x × 4x crosses are given. The 4x × 2x cross gave 91.9% (4x), 7.6% (3x). and 0.6% (2x) based on an examination of 344 individuals, while 676 individuals of the 2x × 4x cross were found to be 94.8% (4x), 1.9% (3x), and 3.3 %(2x). The high seed set pollinators gave 98.4% (4x) and 1.6% (3x) progeny based on 551 individuals. The fact that they produced a higher frequency of tetraploids and a lower frequency of triploids than did the other 2x pollinators suggests that the triploid frequency is not dependent on seed set and also that in crosses where seed set is above average the additional seeds are likely to be tetraploid. The high frequency of tetraploids. plus the relative ease of crossing between diploids and tetraploids makes this method of gene transfer both highly effective and quite efficient. © 1968 Springer.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344318018

The resulting F1-plants were male sterile annuals being two or three times back-crossed to diploid and tetraploid sugar and fodder beets in the next years. Apart from tetraploid material (36 chromosomes) hexaploid (54 chromosomes) and a number of aneuploid plants developed. The results obtained justify the conclusion that, at a tetraploid level the material mostly propagates apomictically after the F1 generation. The presence of penta-, hexa-, septa-and even octaploid plants might be explained by assuming that no meiosis has taken place in the crossing partners. Triploid plants are sometimes found in the progeny of hexaploid material and may presumably be considered haploids. Moreover some pentaploid plants were found in the progeny of the open pollinated F1 which after two generations of bagging are still pentaploids although they produce no pollen. This is another clear indication of apomictic reproduction. The tetraploid generation from the cross between the hexaploid material and diploid sugar beets probably contains the best prospects for breeding. © 1968 H.

The yield of seed from plants crossed in a glasshouse using glassine bags was low. When terylene bags were used in the glasshouse, for an identical set of crosses, the seed yield was increased five-fold, while with terylene bags used in the open there was a seven-fold increase. In addition, the seed produced in terylene bags was of higher quality than that from glassine bags. The normal practice of removing the flag leaf laminae of the enclosed culms appeared to be largely ineffective in improving the yield or quality of the seed produced. From a comparison of the floral environment within a glassine and a terylene bag being used for artificial hybridisation in the glasshouse, it is concluded that the large difference in seed yield and seed quality between glassine and terylene crossing bags was due to differences in the relative humidity of the air within the bags. The greatly increased seed yield of crosses isolated by terylene bags compared with conventional glassine bags offers new prospects for grass breeding, in that quantities of seed adequate for the assessment of single-cross progenies under simulated sward conditions can be obtained. © 1968 H.

The priming effect was readily reversed by stopping challenges for several days. It was shown that environmental exposure during the ragweed pollinating season also primed ragweed-sensitive individuals. Reversibility of the priming effect required weeks after seasonal pollen exposure had ceased. In four subjects challenged during the season, the pollen dose which caused an acute episode of allergic rhinitis varied according to skin-sensitizing antibody titer; the higher the titer, the greater the susceptibility.

Treatment with 0.25% colchicine produced a high number of tetraploid plants. Polyploidy brought about self-compatibility in all but one genotype of S heterozygous constitution, which are normally self-incompatible in the diploid state. This genetic phenomenon, reported to be due to competitive interaction between two different S alleles in the diploid pollen, was found to vary greatly in degree of expression not only between diferent genotypes but also between different plants of the same genotype. Treatment with a much lower strength of colchicine (0.1%) produced virtually no polyploids, but over 25% of the diploid seedlings showed selfcompatibility. This self-compatibility was very erratic, certain flowers in a continuous series of pollinations showing self-compatibility, while others showed self-incompatibility. Alterations of the self-incompatibility reaction, other than that due to competitive interaction, are ascribed here to changes in certain non-genetic, particulate or non-particulate cytoplasmic constituents. The inconsistency between flower pollinations is due to irregular inter-cellular distribution of the particulate elements. The non-particulate element(s) affected by the treatment is believed to be a constituent of the induction or repression system involved in the regulation of S gene activity in the shoot or root. © 1968 Martinus Nijhoff.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001316733

Six clearly distinguishable levels in the evolution of flower types are correlated with six corresponding stages of sensory development of pollinating insects (Figs. 1, 2). This sequence of floral evolution was used for classification of present-day flower types (Fig. 4), and for identification of flower imprints in fossilized clays, muds, and fine sands. It was also used as a practical yardstick to determine the relative sensory ability of various groups of pollinating insects to distinguish flower types (Fig. 3). This zoophilous trend of floral evolution is directed towards improvement of fine biochemical qualities of higher plants, and in this respect it is comparable to the evolution of cultivated plants of man. In both cases better looking individuals of the most useful species are preserved for further crossings and selections, whereas individuals of poor quality are neglected or rejected. During a roughly estimated 200 million years, the selective activity of pollinating insects has produced a variety of plants with high biochemical qualities. These have served man as progenitors of presentday cultivated plants. By similar reasoning, it took prehistoric man about 4,000 years to develop existing cultivated plants from wild progenitors. © 1968 E. J. Brill.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345687603

Later, the styles bend over and these same insects place a mixture of pollen from many flowers on the stigmas, rather than a coat of pollen from the same flower as would have been the case had the styles been bent over from the time of flower opening. The flowers pollinated by hummingbirds (flying all day) are much slower to turn down their stigmas than are the species pollinated by early morning bees with a short flight period.

This paper gives an account of the spores in aquatic liverworts, non-fern pteridophytes, water ferns, and angiosperms. These plants show different degrees of aquaticism and they determine the mode of dispersal of their spores and pollen grains. In truly aquatic plants, the exosporium is simple and thin-walled. The spores or pollen grains in them are short-lived and germinate quickly. They are dependent on water for dispersal. On the other hand, in semi-aquatic or facultatively aquatic plants, the pollen grains and spores have a thick exosporium. Their dispersal is either by insects or wind. Some of the water plants seem to have become secondarily adapted to an aquatic habitat. Their transition was from animophily to entomophily or from entomophily to partial hydrophily. They seem to have developed special adaptations for such transitions. The water ferns with their well developed exosporium and modified perisporium have special adaptations and special dispersal mechanisms. These have helped them in their survival from the Early Tertiary to the present times. A large number of aquatic angiosperms belong to the monocotyledons. They seem to have deviated from the great Ranalian plexus at a very early stage in evolution, on account of which their pollen-grain characteristics resemble those of primitive families of the Ranales. Despite their excellent adaptation to the water habitat, reflected in their vegetative characters, they are quite conservative in their pollen-grain characters and their pollinating and dispersing mechanisms. © 1968.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343267994

In the clinical study a course of immunization with the principal antigen of ragweed (antigen E) was compared to placebo injections in matched groups of patients. Double blind evaluation of the patient's symptoms was performed in a semiquantitative fashion by patient diary and physician examination. The laboratory study involved an in vitro model of human allergic reactions: the antigenically induced release of histamine from the isolated leukocytes of sensitive donors. This system allows an independent evaluation of cellular reactivity and the level of blocking antibodies, the latter measured by their ability to inhibit the in vitro allergic response. The sensitivity of an untreated donor's cells to ragweed antigen E correlated significantly (P < 0.01) with the degree of clinical illness suffered during the season of ragweed pollination. Immunotherapy did not change the dose-response relationships of the sensitive cells, but the cell sensitivity symptom correlation was altered so that the symptoms in the treated patients were less than predicted by their cell sensitivity. Blocking antibody was increased by immunization to levels several thousandfold greater than control. The antibody response correlated significantly with the quantity of antigen E administered (17 to 800 ?g.). Of eighteen pairs of treated and placebo patients, matched by cell sensitivity measurements, the treated partner had an appreciably lower symptom score in 10 pairs, there was little difference in 7 pairs and the untreated partner had a lower score in one pair (p < 0.01). The patients with the higher levels of antibody did better, on the average, than those with the lower. The relationship, however, was neither precise nor constant. This may be due to the lack of precision inherent in evaluating symptoms, but it is also possible that antibodies closer to the target organ, e.g., in the nasal secretions, are more important than serum antibodies. © 1968.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014277141

The meiosis progressed to the open spireme stage of meiotic prophase between late December and early January and temporarily slowed down for about a month. The PMCs resumed meiosis in early February of the following year, and the first metaphase was observed during the period from mid February to the first half of late February. Pollen tetrads were formed in late February. The period of meiosis was about 100 days. Meiosis in PMCs took place in the cold season, that is, when the mean temperature was below 10°C. 2) In the meiosis of PMCs, chromosome bridges, lagging chromosomes, abnormal partition wall formation and regression were sometimes observed. As a result of these abnormal divisions, giant pollen grains were produced, which were classified into three types by their shape: round, oval and gourd-shape. In the mature giant pollen grain, two kinds were recognized. The one contained a generative nucleus in each pollen grain, and the other, two generative nuclei. The former was diploid pollen. The average diameter of the giant pollen grain was 43.8?, which is about 10?larger than that of normal pollen. There was a difference in the frequency in the occurrence of giant pollen grain among individuals. 3) Immature pollen grains after the separation from tetrad grew rapidly in early March. Mitotic division began 5?7 days before pollen dispersion. In mature pollen grains, a reproductive cell and a pollen tube cell were recognized. The mature pollen began to disperse during the period of March 8?15. The number of days required from the tetrad formation to the pollen dispersion was about 15 days. 4) From the artificial germination test, the first pollen germination was observed 57sim;7 days before the pollen dispersion. Thereafter, the germination percentage increased rapidly with pollen development and attained the maximum point at the time of pollen dispersion. From the above results, the most favorable time for pollen collection is considered to be the time of natural pollen dispersion. It seems to be difficult to extract pollen before the natural dispersion for artificial pollination. © 1968, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007920710

The latter type of fruit is seedless, as is the former, and the stimulus for its development is provided by the wasps ovipositing in the flower ovaries and by the subsequent activity of the wasp larvae within. In order to ascertain the reason for the absence of seeds, controlled pollination experiments were conducted. These experiments, and also systematic observations on the sequence of flowering generations throughout the year, have yielded information on seed?setting and the interrelations between the sycomore and its wasps.

The frequency of successful self?pollination in individual plants of these races varies from zero to 100%, and is positively correlated with the average number of seeds in self?pollinated siliquas. Eleven races of L. crassa and three races of L. alabaimca are adapted to self?pollination and are described as self?compatible, although self?pollinations succeed 2% less frequently than cross?pollinations. Self?pollinated siliquas of these races contain an average of 12% fewer seeds than cross?pollinated siliquas; this is probably an expression of cryptic self?incompatibility and not the result of the exposure of seed lethals on inbreeding. There is, therefore, no absolute distinction between self?incompatibility and self?compatibility in Leavemcorthia. The growth of pollen tubes is compared in successful and unsuccessful pollinations of the same type, in self? and cross?pollinations of the same individuals, and in self?incompatible and self?compatible races. Pollen grains react with the stigma even in unsuccessful pollinations and some pollen grains are inhibited in successful pollinations. In both self?incompatible and self?compatible races, the average number of emptied pollen grains on the stigmata of successful pollinations (an estimate of the number of pollen tubes in the styles) is similar after self? and cross?pollinations. But the average number of emptied pollen grains is lower in self?incompatible races than in self?compatible races. The results are interpreted in terms of the response of pollen grains to an essential growth substance supplied by the stigma. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell.

The chemicals were sprayed on young flowers which were emasculated just before anthesis and the flowers cut two weeks after treatment were used for observations. NAA and 2, 4-D, especially the latter, produce the parthenocarpic caryopses efficiently but unexpectedly at any concentration of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 50.0 ppm of gibberellin failed to promote the growth of the ovary wall parthenocarpically. Above results indicate that in rice plants the effective growth substances to induce the parthenocarpy may be auxins and not gibberellins when they are applied at the stage of anthesis. Several workers have reported on the effectiveness of gibberellins in stimulating parthenocarpy in various plants. The reason why gibberellin does not display the same effect on the rice plants may be an interesting problem to be resolved in the near future. Furthermore, it was found that even in the control plots (emasculated and sprayed with distilled water) the parthenocarpic caryopses were observed frequently in two varieties used, especially in Tokaiasahi, the latest maturing variety of all. This indicates that in rice plants there is possibility to induce the parthenocarpy without the pollination process and that in some varieties there seems to be enough endogenous auxin in the ovary at the stage of anthesis to promote the growth of the ovary wall by itself. The result previously reported by the writer that frequent parthenocarpic caryopses can be induced by gibberellin treated at the stage of young panicle primordium differentiation should be considered to be resulted not with the direct but the auxin-mediated effect of gibberellin during the pistillate organ development with or without pollination. Also, on the prevailing phenomenon of parthenocarpy in rice plants caused by an unfavourable low temperature, the endogenous auxin should be considered to be an important factor stimulating the ovary wall growth with or without pollination process. © 1968, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

Salmon's nucleus was placed by repeated backcrosses into the three alien cytoplasms of Aegilops caudata, Ae. ovata and Triticum timopheevi, and the occurrence of haploids and twins was investigated in the three nucleus-substitution lines (indicated by (caudata)-Salmon, (ovata)-Salmon and (timopheevi)-Salmon) and a normal line of Salmon. Both haploids and twins were frequently found only in (caudata)-Salmon; Ae. caudata cytoplasm was evidently different in this regard from the other cytoplasms employed. 2. In (caudata)-Salmon, parthenogenetic embryos were found in 29.8 per cent of ovules, which remained non-pollinated and were fixed six to nine days after emasculation, while 29.4 per cent of plants obtained from pollination delayed for five to nine days after emasculation were haploid. This fact indicates that haploid formation in this material is mainly due to haploid parthenogenesis of the egg cell. 3. Frequency of twin seedlings was on the average 6.5 per cent, most of them being of haplo-diplo type. Embryological studies of non-pollinated and delayed pollinated ovules as well as cytological and morphological studies of twin seedlings revealed that parthenogenetic development of the egg cell, followed by fertilization of one of the synergids is the main mechanism of the formation of twin embryos; fertilization of a synergid was taking place in about 24 per cent of ovules, whose egg cell had developed parthenogenetically. © 1968, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Many larvae collected on April 22 from the male flower of Populus maximowiczii, were reared by the writers in an outside unheated insectary at Kuriyama, Hokkaido. The larvae are yellow to pale orange in colour. Full-grown larvae leave the male flowers, and descend to the soil at the beginning of May. Usually pupation occurs within 7 or 8 days after the larvae have descended to the ground. The first adults emerged on May 14, 1966 in the insectary. The larvae which are probably pollen eaters occur on the male aments of Populus maximowiczii, lowering the density of pollen in the open pollination.

In each of the 7 pairs, self-pollinations of the control and M1 plants and both reciprocal crosses were performed 5 times. Data were obtained on pollen fertility (by a staining test), seed set, seed germination and number of seedlings per fruit. The female and the male gametes of an M1 plant were both found to produce sterility when crossed to a control plant. Comparison between the two reciprocal crosses showed that the average contribution of M1 egg cells to the total amount of sterility of the 7 M1 plants was no larger than that due to the corresponding pollen grains. The fact that the M1 pollen grains, despite their numerical superiority, determine a sterility effect no lower than that induced by the M1 egg cells, is explained by a greater ability of the female gametes to tolerate the genetic damage induced from the mutagenic treatment. © 1967.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49949134001

A high percentage of pod set was induced with all treatments using 2,4-D, dicamba, and IAA-IBA syrup. Only the highest concentration of NAA yielded similar results. Limited set resulted from treatments with Gibrel. The application of 0.1 mg of 2,4-D in lanolin paste around the base of the calyx resulted in pods that, although weighing less, were similar in size to those from hand-pollinated flowers. Repeated applications with 0.1% of 2,4-D in lanolin paste and the removal of all unopened buds after four pods had set in the raceme had little influence on pod size. Dicamba and 2,4-D were translocated from the treated flower to buds in the same raceme, inducing these to set fruit. Dicamba was translocated also from one raceme to another. Growth curves of parthenocarpic and seeded pods were of the sigmoid type. Ovaries of flowers treated with 0.1 mg of 2,4-D grew at their maximum rate during the first week after treatment while those of pollinated flowers reached this peak three weeks after treatment.

At 4000R no seedlings survived beyond 1 yr of age. At the end of 2 yr, approximately 30 per cent of the seedlings from seed given 1000 R survived as compared to the control. A decrease in LD50 exposure was noted as the seedlings aged; 2.25 R at 40 days, 1710 R at 130 days and 700 R at 14 months. The LD50 determined from the survival response curves was found to be linear over the first two growing seasons permitting prediction of the dosage that would result in 50 percent plant survival at any point in the first 2 yr. Cone development and yield of X2 seed/cone following self-pollination were reduced in the irradiated trees as compared to the controls. Seed germination, however, was higher in the seed from trees grown from the 1000 R irradiated seed than from the controls, suggesting an apparent stimulation of seed viability. Survival in the X1 generation and the quantity and quality of X2 seed produced on X1 trees showed that the reproductive capacity was reduced by seed X-irradiation at 1000 R to slightly over 10 percent in cross-pollinated X2 seed production, and to less than 5 percent after self-pollination.

In order to make a comparison between the observed and predicted response to selection for increased grain yield, a mating design was imposed on the original Iowa Ideal variety. Ninety-six half-sib families containing 384 full-sib families were developed and evaluated in three environments. Estimates of additive and total genetic variances were obtained for grain yield and eight other traits. For all traits, the estimates indicated that the greatest proportion of the total genetic variance was due to additive effects; this was under the assumption of no epistasis. The estimates for yield indicated that approximate 80% of the total genetic variance was additive. This would indicate that some form of intra-population selection should be effective, initially, for increasing the frequency of favorable factors determining yield. Additive genetic, genotypic, and phenotypic correlations showed that ear length was the most important component of yield in the Iowa Ideal variety. The initial evaluation of the original and three reconstituted populations, formed by compositing equal quantities of seed from individually selected ears, was made in 1965. The observed progress for increased grain yield was less than the predicted on the basis of the variance component estimates. For a selection intensity of 7.5% in each cycle of selection, observed progress for increased grain yield was 1.5% per cycle or year. Either the estimates of additive genetic variance were over-estimated, or the individual plant selection techniques were not precise enough to properly identify the higher-yielding genotypes in the selection program. © 1967 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250516067

It is suggested that a number of traits which appear to a greater degree in ""elite"" lines than in those resulting from non-selective inbreeding could be the result of selection for genes or chromosomal segments derived from the introgression of maize and teosinte. Yet lines exhibiting maximum teosinte influence would not likely survive the screening imposed by visual selection. Evidence is presented which suggests that visual selection as practiced during inbreeding has little, if any, direct influence on yield in hybrid combinations. With respect to the inheritance of combining ability, results from these experiments support the assumption that high × high general combiners, on the average, tend to be higher yielding than any other set of combinations of high, medium, or low general combiners. It is, however, difficult to account for the relatively high yields of high × low general combiners on the basis of additive gene action alone. It is suggested that in material as heterogeneous as open pollinated Corn Belt varieties, as much genetic diversity can come from within varieties as from between varieties, particularly if the varieties themselves have undergone extensive introgression during the course of their evolution. © 1967 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250511360

Sea-grasses are aquatic angiosperms which are completely adapted to life in the marine environment. They belong to 2 families, the Potamogetonaceae with 9 marine genera and the Hydrocharitaceae with 3 marine genera. 2. All sea-grasses satisfy the following indispensable conditions for a successful existence in the sea: (a) high salt tolerance, (b) ability to grow when fully submerged, (c) well-developed rhizomes, (d) hydrophilous pollination, and (e) sufficient competitive power in the marine environment. 3. Plant taxa which fulfill the first 4 conditions excellently, but have a reduced competition capacity, are unable to establish themselves successfully in the marine environment and are restricted to poikilohaline environments, such as brackish waters and continental salt waters. Moreover, some of these taxa occur in instable fresh-water environments. 4. Within the group of the sea-grasses 6 different growth-forms can be distinguished: parvozosterids, magnozosterids, syringodiids, enhalids, halophilids and amphibolids. 5. The growth-forms are linked with the environmental conditions: they show a distinct horizontal zonation and in the succession series they follow each other in a fixed sequence. 6. The structure of the communities is also dependent on the dominating growthforms. The communities of parvozosterids and halophilids are very simple in structure. The magnozosterid vegetations show some differentiation. In the enhalid and amphibolid communities a marked stratification occurs, as an upper layer, characterized by photophilous epiphytes on the leaves, and a lower layer with sciophilous epiphytes on the rhizomes can be distinguished. 7. Sea-grass communities alter the physical environment by stabilizing the bottom, slackening the water movements and increasing the sedimentation. 8.

This degeneration is marked by the swelling and darkening of the organelle membranes, the collapse of the vacuoles, and the disappearance of the plasma membrane. Striking chemical changes accompany the structural degeneration. 2. The pollen tube grows into the degenerating synergid through the filiform apparatus. The tube ceases growth while the tip is still in the synergid. A pore develops on the chalazal side of the tube in a subterminal position. 3.

None of the discharge leaves the synergid except the sperm nuclei which enter the egg or central cell directly from the synergid.

Kenaf, grown for its bast fiber and also under investigation as a source of paper pulp, is fast-growing and well adapted to mechanical harvesting, but susceptible to root-knot nematodes. Roselle, also grown for its bast fiber, is slower growing, not well adapted to mechanical harvesting, but certain varieties are resistant to root-knot nematodes. Five hybrid plants were produced from the pollination of 4,445 flowers of kenaf with pollen from roselle; no hybrid plants were produced from 2,655 pollinations made in the reciprocal direction. One line of roselle was the parent of 3 of the 5 hybrids; one line of kenaf was the parent of 2 of these 3. The F1 hybrids were triploid, and varied in vigor, growth habit and vegetative morphology, but had similar flowers. Two of the F1 hybrids showed high pollen fertility, apparently as a result of restitution at first meiotic division leading to unreduced spores. These two hybrids each produced a small amount of seed, which gave rise to an F2 population of 22 plants. The F2 plants vary in vigor but are morphologically uniform, have thick leaves with mosaic sectors, and are presumably spontaneous allohexaploids. The theoretical possibilities of increasing the percentage of recovery of the F1 interspecific hybrids and of developing a synthesized hybrid variety useful for bast fiber and paper pulp are discussed. © 1967 H.

The red varieties had a significantly better survival than the white varieties. In the first season, single plant selections were made from the varieties having both the highest percentage of winter survival and the best agronomic characters. Although some of the progenies derived from these selected plants by self-pollination showed a small increase in winter survival as compared with their parent varieties when both were grown in the second season, no plants of these progenies were sufficiently hardy to remain marketable after moderate frost. It was concluded that none of the varieties tested showed any promise as a source of winter hardiness to be used in a breeding programme, and that selection for one generation from within these varieties did not improve winter hardiness to a useful extent. © 1967 H.

False-underground hives were much less costly to set out than underground hives and attracted many more queens of surface-nesting and versatile species, as well as underground-nesting species, than did surface hives. Apparently the surface-nesting species will accept a nest that is entered through an upward-sloping tunnel but not one that must be reached through a downward-sloping tunnel; underground-nesting species require a tunnel but are not influenced by the direction of its slope.

Don was studied. Five seed groups, namely, selfed seed lots of naturally (TG-5) or gibberellin induced flowers (BG-5) of a tree, G-5, and naturally set flowers (C-5) of another tree, C-5, and TG-5×C-5, and open pollinated seeds of TG-5, were irradiated with acute gamma rays (3,000 R/day) of 6,000, 12,000 and 15,000 R in the gamma field of the Institute of Radiation Breeding. The selfed seeds from gibberellin induced flowers had less viability in the control and after gamma ray treatment they showed further retardation in germinability. On the other hand, open pollinated seeds from TG-5 showed the highest resistance to the radiation. Hybrid seeds between two trees showed intermediate germination percentage between those of open pollinated seeds and selfed seeds of artificially induced flowers, and a slightly higher value than those of selfed seeds of both of their parents, indicating a heterotic effect of the hybrid seeds on the radiosensitivity. With those germination percentage resulted from the irradiated seeds, genetical and physiological share on the radiosensitivity was estimated, and the genetical portion was dominant over the physiological in 12,000 and 15,000 R exposure. The tree, G-5, proved to have a recessive gene producing seedlings with light green cotyledon in 3 : 1 ratio after selfing in both naturally or gibberellin induced flowers. The selfed seeds (BG-5) after gibberellin treatment were irradiated with gamma rays to examine their segregation ratio, and biased ratios favouring lower percentage of the variants were noted. It was thought that the genetical composition of a seed population may be slightly changed in the X1 population by selective damage of the radiation on seeds with some special genotypes. Abnormality in cell division expressed by percentage of cells with Chromosomal bridge increased linearly with the intensity of gamma exposure. © 1967, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

When protected, pollen viability on female inflorescences is good up to 6 days, after which it declines. The majority of the pollen remains below the canopy, especially at bunch level. Results of quantitative evaluation of pollen dispersal showed that atmospheric pollen density is very variable and is governed by numerous factors. There is a marked diurnal variation, with highest pollen density during the afternoon and a negligible amount during the night and early morning. Rain causes an immediate drop in concentration, but pollen densities were influenced more by the number of days on which rain was recorded than by total rainfall. A relationship exists between pollen density, the number of male inflorescences in the vicinity, and rainfall, but the effects of relative humidity, sunshine and wind are obscure. Whilst pollen density drops rapidly within a short distance from the inflorescence, there is a significant dispersal over greater distances than previously thought. © 1967, Cambridge University Press.

Honeybees were no more constant to purple-coloured florets than to yellow, but the larger number visiting the former resulted in a higher percentage of non-hybrid progeny from purple-flowered plants when these were grown in association with yellow-flowered plants. Side-collectors of nectar tripped a higher percentage of standardless mutants (2·6%) than normal florets (0·8%) in the field, but this percentage is too low to be practical for commercial pollination of alfalfa.

The proportion of foragers that collected pollen and the amount of pollen collected increased with the amount of brood present. Bees foraged less from colonies deprived of brood and many former pollen-gatherers changed to collecting nectar only.2.The smell of brood alone and contact with bees tending the brood were each partly responsible for foragers collecting pollen, but access to the brood was the most important factor. When the brood was inaccessible, foraging decreased and many pollen-gatherers collected nectar only.3.Although brood of all stages stimulated pollen collection, in some circumstances larvae were more effective than pupae.4.Absence of a queen, with or without brood, increased nectar collection and decreased pollen collection but did not affect the number of foragers.5.Giving pollen to a colony decreased its pollen collection and increased its nectar collection, but giving carbohydrate did not influence foraging.6.These results are discussed in relation to using colonies more efficiently for pollination. © 1967.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014047353

The occurrence and extent of seed?transmission depended on both the virus and the host plant. In many progenies more than 10%, and in some 100%, of seedlings were infected.

Oenothera berteriana is a complex heterozygote species with genome complexes named B and 1. Egg and sperm cells were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate. Thereafter self-pollination was carried out. Because both genomes may be mutated by the mutagen, the genetic constitution of the M1-mutants was termed B? and l?, respectively. These mutants were crossed to plants which carry in the pollen either the B or 1 complex. Because there are no homozygous forms, crossing of B?.l? × B yields B.1? plants, crossing of B?.1? × 1 only B?.1 plants. Thus it was possible to compare the EMS sensitivity of the genomes. It was found that the genome complex 1 is considerably more sensitive to EMS than is the genome complex B. This agrees with the findings after X-irradiation. It could be shown by the experiments with X-rays that the different sensitivity of the two genomes is caused by a different chromosome mutation rate; aberrations are more often induced in chromosomes of the l-complex than in chromosomes of the B-complex. This higher sensitivity of the 1-genome for X-rays and ethyl methanesulfonate is presumably caused by small, scarcely visible, deficiencies. Translocations cannot account for this phenomenon, since they do not appear after ethyl methanesulfonate treatment in Oenothera berteriana. The translocations which often can be found after X-irradiation are, however, important for the appearance of trisomic plants in the X2-generation. For the frequency of non-disjunction is raised by these translocated chromosomes. Since ethyl methanesulfonate does not cause translocations, there are no trisomic plants in the M2-generation. © 1967.",ÄMS; Äthylmethansulfonat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014145229

Robertson1, and Peterson and Wernsman2 later described this technique in detail. In outline, the technique uses the deficient plants that result when pollen carrying an A-B translocation is used in a cross. These plants are deficient for the portion of the chromosome translocated to the B centromere. By using an mbred incorporating an A-B translocation as a male parent in a cross to a different inbred, some of the F1 plants will be deficient (hemizygous) for the translocated portion of the A genome. If these deficient plants are used as females in a backcross to the inbred A-B translocation line, deficient plants again will be produced. A series of such backcrosses, choosing deficient plants each generation, will result ultimately in a line that has been converted to the background of the recurrent parent except for that portion of the chromosome that is translocated to the B centromere. Since deficient (hemizygous) plants were chosen for pollination each generation, this portion of the chromosome will have had no opportunity to pair with the corresponding chromosomal segment of the recurrent parent and, therefore, will be transferred intact from the inbred used as a female parent in the F1 cross. © 1967 by the American Genetics Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962992634

The relationship of this group of species to other members of the genus, such as A. gracilis Benth., is considered. Despite widespread evidence of hybridization and introgression, the three maritime species (A. latifolia Eschsch., A. maritima Nutt. ex S. Wats., and A. umbellata Lam.) maintain their distinctness. Most of the taxonomic segregants in this group have been based on what appear to be hybrid or introgressed individuals, many of which closely resemble members of a series of artificial hybrids made in the greenhouse. The chromosome number of all three species is estimated as 2 n = ca. 46. The species are shown to differ markedly in ecological preference: A. latifolia competing successfully on stable areas of dunes from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to Santa Barbara Co., California; A. maritima being the major foredune former along the strand from San Luis Obispo Co., California, south to Nayarit, Mexico; and A. umbellata occurring on more stable dunes from San Luis Obispo to San Diego Co., California, and sporadically north and south of this area. The latter species is pollinated chiefly by nocturnal insects and is fragrant in the evening, whereas the other two have diurnal flowers. One widespread and two rarer, more northern subspecies of A. umbellata are recognized in the taxonomic revision, while the other two species are not subdivided taxonomically. © 1967, The New York Botanical Garden.

Selfing of the Kuma-Sugi was also made to analyse recessive genes on chlorophyll variations as well as self-fertility and growth of the progeny. Though no big difference in percentage of matured cones after pollination of each pollen was observed, low seed weight per cone and low 1,000-seed-weight were correlated with the inferior cross-fertility expressed by the germination percentage of the seeds. The selfed seeds had about 1% germinability, and the seeds pollinated with Urasebaru pollen showed the same degree of germinability indicating low cross-fertility with Kuma-Sugi. About 35% germination was secured in the seeds pollinated with Obiaka, Kumotôshi, Iwao-Sugi and C-1 showing high cross-fertility, and pollen parents of Sanbu-Sugi and Aya-Sugi were revealed to be intermediate in the trait. Almost no correlation was noted between the mean seedling height of a sowing row (40 cm), where 100 seeds were sown, and the seedling density in the row, and the mean seedling height differed largely by various pollen parents. Especially, in the germinating-boxes (0.55×0.40×0.25 m3) for the test, the seedlings with the pollen parents of Iwao-Sugi, Sanbu-Sugi and C-1 exhibited better height growth, and they had shorter mean germination period and 50% (of the seeds germinated) germination day than those of the other cross-combination. Most of the seeds were distributed to the Tohoku Forest Tree Breeding Station (Morioka) and the Kanto Forest Tree Breeding Station (Mito) to grow seedlings in their respective nurseries. The mean seedling heights for each pollen parent in 3 nurseries in Morioka, Mito and Ohmiya (Ibaraki) had significant correlation with those in the germinating-boxes except for Ohmiya (Fig. 2.). This might mean that no special interaction existed between the seedling heights and several climatical and pedological factors in these places. In Kuma-Sugi, two single recessive genes which were responsible to produce seedlings with light green cotyledon (complete lethal) and with white primary leaves (incomplete lethal) were detected. Theoretically, the segregation ratio of 9 (normal): 3 (white primary leaves): 3 (light green cotyledon): 1 (light green cotyledon with white primary leaves) is expected after selfing, but, owing to the death of the seedlings showing light green cotyledon before their development of the primary leaves, the doubly homozygous seedlings for the recessive genes are scored only on light green cotyledon. So, observed segregation ratio was 9 (normal): 3 (white primary leaves): 4 (light green cotyledon). Phenotypically similar recessive genes for light green seedlings detected in a Sugi (No. G-5) and in a cutting variety. Kumotôshi. were proved to be different from the gene of Kuma-Sugi. © 1967, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011125865

From these figures a crossover rate of about 8.7% for the distance between Wx and the Ga factor, found by the senior author, can be calculated. A similar procedure for the repulsion phase Ga wx/gaWx (originally and independently found by Schwartz and Salamini) leads to an estimate of about 13% as a c.o. distance between Wx and ga (555 ears with a large excess of wx, 152 with 25%wx kernels, 105 ears with no wx, and 5 ears with a great deficiency of wx). The same factor was located between Wx and Bz, at about 2/3 of the Wx-Bz distance from Wx. Selfed ears of plants Ga sh C/ga Sh c give an excess of sh (about 36.3%), and a deficiency of c (15.3%). If ga gametes are assumed to be non functional (as indicated by other results), these data suggest that ga is about 27 c.o. units from sh, and 31 from c. A distance of the same order of magnitude from sh is determined from ears of selfed plants of genotype Ga Sh/ga sh which show 12%sh kernels. An additional chromosome 9 marker, closely linked to ga, is an albino seedling factor (w). The data indicate that the albino factor is closer to Ga than wx; they also permit to estimate the c.o. value between wx and w (about 2±0.2%). If ga-gametes do not function, the percentage of w seedlings (about 2%) doubled (4%) provides an estimate of the c.o. value between w and ga. The distance wx-w was also obtained as variable between 0 and 7 c.o. units.

In addition, pollen treated as above was stored dry for 1 day before pollination. The major problem was to evaluate the effects of X-rays on the frequency of mutations in hydrated pollen. Here, response was measured using these 5 criteria: (1) seed set, (2) R1 seed germination, (3) R1 phenotypic changes, (4) R1 pollen fertility and (5) R2 mutations from R1 plants. The data on seed set supported the hypothesis that: (a) Seed set was decreased with an increase in dose when pollen was treated at 25 °C. However, seed set was generally higher when pollen was treated at 0 °C. (b) Treated dry pollen set less seed than moist pollen. There were only slight differences in seed set due to moisture per se but hydrated pollen treated at 25°C for1/2 hr and at 0 °C for 3 hr gave the best seed set. In general, the LD50 based on average seed set for dry and hydrated pollen was not the same for 25 and 0 °C. (c) Pollen stored in hydrated condition produced less seed than non-stored hydrated pollen. Dry pollen treatments were shown to reduce seed germination of the R1 In general, the percent seed germination of the R1 derived from treated dry pollen was lower than that from irradiated hydrated pollen. Pollen treated at 0 °C yielded R1 seed that germinated better than R1 seed derived from pollen treated at 25 °C. Among the recovered R1 seedlings with phenotypic changes, morphological off-types occurred more frequently than chlorophyll and B types. A high percentage of these types, however, were not recovered in the R2 generation. At 25 °C, treated dry pollen and treated moist pollen yielded the same total percentage of R1 seedling off-types. On the other hand, differences in R1 types were shown at 0 °C. That is, pollen treated dry yielded more off-types in the R1 than pollen humidified for 1/2 hr at 0 °C. The phenotypically normal R1 plants were classified for pollen fertility. The data from both 25 and 0 °C treatments indicated that pollen fertility of the R1 plants decreased as a result of dry pollen irradiation. In addition, pollen fertility was shown to decrease with an increase in X-ray exposure at both 25 and 0 °C. Finally, the percentage of R2 families that segregated for mutations was relatively high after dry pollen treatments at 25 °C.

At all the exposures studied the pollen was capable of germinating on the stigmas and the tubes were able to grow down to and penetrate the embryo sacs. In the pollen tube mitoses the following abnormalities were seen: chromosome stickiness, bridges and fragments. After exposures of 1-5 kR two sperm nuclei of equal or unequal size were formed, and these were not accompanied by fragments or connected by bridges. After exposures of 10-50 kR the sperm chromatin was highly variable and the following types were seen: undivided generative nuclei, two sperm nuclei of equal or unequal size with or without extra nuclear fragments and free or connected by bridges. After exposures of 150-500 kR undivided generative nuclei with or without nuclear fragments were found. The same types of nuclei were found in pollen tubes that had entered the embryo sac and their fusion with the female nuclei could be observed. Largely as a consequence of the differences in type of the male chromatin, the following different types of fertilization were observed, (a) Both the egg nucleus and the polar nuclei are fertilized by sperm chromatin from one or two pollen tubes, (b) Fertilization of only the egg nucleus or only the polar nuclei occurs, the other of these two kinds of female nuclei remaining unfertilized. The following types were observed with respect to nuclear fusion, (a) A normal fusion as in untreated material (1-500 kR).

Larger (probably fertilized) ovules matured into seeds, whereas smaller (probably unfertilized ovules) dried into scales. Besides the incompatibility barrier in sweet potato, which inhibits pollen-germination, a physiological or mechanical barrier between stigma and style is hypothesized. Pollen tube growth is not appreciably inhibited within the style. A third barrier between stylar penetration and mature seed development is postulated but not identified.

High organ specificity (leaves, unpollinated styles, pollen) was observed, along with a high content of free tryptophane and proline in the pollen. In unpollinated styles slow protein synthesis takes place during the first 24 hour period after their removal from the plant. After cross pollination a slight decrease in net protein content is seen which is due to the presence of penetrating pollen tubes. An increase noted in the concentration of amide containing groups can be linked to protein and amino acid degradation. In the first 12 - 18 hrs. after self pollination protein synthesis stops abruptly, to be resumed again slowly after 20 hrs. This change does not correspond to an alteration in free amino acid concentration. In pollinated styles the amount of free amino acids from protein degradation is much higher than the actual increase of amino acid concentration, especially after selfing. This must mean that the amino acids resulting from protein hydrolysis are used up as an energy supplying substrate. There is evidence for the existence of two different amino acid pools in the style: a storage pool to serve as source of oxygen for respiration, and another small pool which provides amino acids for protein synthesis. In a style penetrated by growing pollen tubes evidence of compartmenting and metabolic channeling has been obtained, thus variation in the free amino acid pool is the physiological expression of pollen tube growth. The striking increase of the tryptophane concentration, especially after outbreeding, seems to be linked to the metabolism of growth hormones of the indole group. The specific influence of incompatible pollen tubes on the amino acid pools is discussed in connection with recent theories on the physiological mechanism of gametophytic incompatibility and the formation of allosteric molecules as genetic regulators of inhibitor synthesis. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005767510

Three species of Gramineae were used for obeservations on the behavior of the tube nucleus and sperm nuclei in germinating pollen grains of Triticum aestivum, Oryza officinalis and Zea mays. 2. In general all three species follow the same pattern in the behavior of the three nuclei. 3. Normal pollen grains contain one tube nucleus and two sperm nuclei which usually lie on the side of the grain opposite to the one containing the germ pore. 4. Germination of the pollen grains on the stigma starts after 3-5 minutes. 5. Two sperms enter the pollen tube and the tube nucleus follows. 6. In wheat, the tube nucleus remains frequently in the pollen grain, while it almost always emigrates in Oryza and Zea. 7. Empty pollen grains could be observed in wheat 30 minutes after pollination. 8. Germination of the pollen grains is not uniform. Even after 24 hours we found pollen grains at five different stages of germination. 9. The regular sequence in the movement of male and vegetative nuclei is rarely disturbed. 10. It is likely that male gametes are transported passively by the cytoplasmic stream to the pollen tube during germination, since they lie nearer to the germ pore than to the tube nucleus. 11. It is suggested that autonomous movement of male gametes may act as auxiliary agent in transportation. 12. The tube nucleus seems to be intimately connected with the cytoplasm and is located far from the germ pore. This may be the main reason why the tube nucleus enters the pollen tube later than the sperm nuclei. 13. The movements of the vegetative and generative nuclei during pollen formation are given in detail based on an old investigation by the senior author. 14. The behavior of nuclei during gametogenesis follows a definite course, indicating autonomy in the movements of the vegetative as well as the generative nuclei. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27144488539

To answer this question, a short time after pollination pollen grains of the self-incompatible Cruciferae species Arabis arenosa and Brassica nigra were transferred onto a second stigma with other incompatibility genes and their behavior observed. The pollen grains were used under the following pollination conditions: I. crossing ? crossing (control), II. selfing ? crossing, III. selfing ? selfing (control), IV. crossing ? selfing. While the two controls indicated that the reaction of pollen is not changed by the mode of transfer, penetration of the pollen tubes into the second stigma (selfing) could be observed in combination IV. This result suggests an irreversible activation of pollen cutinase by the first stigma (crossing). Because under favourable conditions only short contact of the pollen grain with the stigma is necessary for the activation of cutinase, we suppose that the reaction which induces activity of cutinase takes place between specific structures situated in the wall of pollen grain and papilla. The question whether activation and blockage of activation of the cutinase system is dependent on S-alleles is discussed in connection with the concept of Sampson (1962) on ""species-area""- and the ""S-allele-area""-combination between pollen and stigma. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007365971

The top five, the middle four, and the bottom six laminae accounted, respectively, for 26 per cent, 42 per cent, and 32 per cent of the leaf area duration (D) of the laminae after flowering; the estimated contributions of the three groups to dry-matter production by the laminae after flowering were about 40 per cent, 35-50 per cent, and 5-25 per cent, respectively. The sheaths provided about one-fifth of the total leaf area and probably contributed about one-fifth, and laminae four-fifths, of the total dry matter produced after flowering. The contribution from photosynthesis by the ear was negligible, presumably because its surface area was only 2 per cent of that of the leaves. Leaf efficiency (dry matter produced per unit area) decreased greatly from the top to the base of the shoot. When laminae were removed, the grain received a larger fraction of the dry matter accumulated after flowering, less dry matter remained in the stem, and the photosynthetic efficiency of the remaining leaves was apparently increased.When alternate laminae were removed at the time of silking (half-defoliation) D was decreased by 40 per cent, and the subsequent production of dry matter decreased nearly proportionately, so that net assimilation rate (E) was not affected but grain dry weight was decreased by only 32 per cent. At the final harvest, the grain of half-defoliated plants constituted 80 per cent of the dry matter accumulated after flowering, compared with 65 per cent for intact plants. Stem weight decreased from two weeks after flowering in half-defoliated plants, but remained nearly constant in intact plants. When pollination was prevented and no grains formed, E during the first month after flowering was unaffected; the dry matter that would have passed into the grain accumulated in the stem and husks, not in the leaves.The decrease in stem weight caused by defoliation suggests that previously stored dry matter was moved to the grain. That such movement is possible was shown by keeping prematurely harvested shoots in the dark for two weeks with their cut ends in water; the dry weight of the grain increased and that of the stem, laminae, husks, and core decreased. Nevertheless, dry-matter production after flowering was more than sufficient for grain growth, and previous photosynthesis probably contributed little to the grain. © 1966 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745168271

Within the unpollinated, ripe style of Hippeastrum a pO2 gradient occurs. In the upper part, possibly with a little increase in the stigmatic branches, a very high oxygen tension is found; in the lower part, about 5 mm from the ovary, a sudden decrease occurs. In the ovary itself the oxygen tension is extremely low. After pollination, passage of the mass of pollen tube tips can be followed by a fairly sharp drop of the oxygen tension, which shifts down the style with progressive growth. This oxygen tension depression seems to be sharply limited to the region of pollen tube tips and the amount of decrease is dependent on the growth rate of the tubes. After passage of the pollen the original high level of oxygen tension is not fully restored in the upper style. This suggests that the metabolic activity of the pollen tube is strongly linked with the metabolic condition in the style. It seems that tubes grow most of their way to the egg under aerobic conditions; only at the base of the style, just before entering into the ovary, does the pollen have to switch over to an anaerobic pathway. For most of the style oxygen tension does not form a tropic gradient for tube growth. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-8544232686

Of 99 parent plants originally selected from three different non-inbred varieties only eight were represented in the I4 generation, by which time individual inbred lines were virtually true breeding for characters of commercial importance. An F1 hybrid named Avoncross, produced by crossing unrelated selected inbred lines, has given consistently good yields of high quality sprouts in trials grown during several seasons. In most of these trials Avoncross gave the greatest marketable yield as compared with various control varieties and its superiority was significant at the 5% level of probability. A further F1 hybrid, as yet un-named, has also given promising results in recent trials. Genetic male sterility was found in the material but did not provide an economic method for the production of F1 hybrid seed. The method developed for the field production of F1 hybrid seed relies on natural crossing between partially sib-compatible inbred lines. The partial sib-compatibility makes it possible to multiply the parent inbred lines by using natural sib-pollination in the field, but leads to the presence of sibs in the F1 hybrid seed produced by natural crossing. The percentage of sibs in field crops of the F1 hybrid established from such seed, however, was acceptably low because the majority of the sib-seedlings initially present could be rejected, on the basis of their smaller size, at the time of transplanting from the seedbed to the field. Experimental seed production, both of parent inbred lines and of the F1 hybrid Avoncross, indicated that commercial production of F1 hybrid seed in this manner was likely to be economically feasible. © 1966 H.

The short-tongued bumble bee (Bombus terrestris L.) was of much less value as a pollinator than were long-tongued bumble bees or honey bees. Crops were pollinated as effectively by honey bees as by the two main species of long-tongued bumble bees. In general, very low honey bee densities, expressed as bees per 10,000 flowers, were associated with heavy competition from other nectar sources. Expressed as bees per 10,000 flowers, average concentrations of both honey bees and long-tongued bumble bees were significantly higher for crops with pollination values of 69% or more than they were for crops with values of less than 69%. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007595093

Low concentrations occur along some shores probably due to dilution by terrigenous sediment and winnowing from coarse sediments but high concentrations build-up immediately beyond zones of coarse sediments offshore. Some palynomorphs diminish in number with greater distance from shore (e.g., total spores and pollen, grass, Cheno-Ams, composites, Zea) whereas others become selectively increased in relative frequencies offshore (e.g., pine, mangrove) or in absolute frequency (e.g., dinoflagellates, O sp-1, an unknown entity). Cuticles and tracheids delineate shorelines and deltas and a striking parallelism between absolute frequency of dinoflagellates and relative frequency of fungi deserves further study. Dispersal of pollen and spores by streams and water currents (and in areas of upwelling and through submarine canyons to offshore deeps as submarine fans) appears to be far more important than wind distribution for the Gulf of California area. © 1966.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000395491

It was established that the most frequent families and possibly offending allergens were: (1) Gramineae sp. with a defined pollination in November, December, and part of January; (2) herbaceous plants and some weeds whose pollination is similar to the gramineae, but with an interval in June and August; and (3) trees of which the most frequent is the Acacia, which is used for ornamentation in Bogota. Its greatest pollination is in June, July, and part of August, with a recurrence in December.

A special technique of controlled flowering, emasculation, and pollination was used to effect the hybridization. Hybrid plants were grown in undefoliated swards and assessed for cumulative growth, variation in the reproductive phase, tillering, and summer survival. The combining abilities of the parents were estimated for these characters. Hybrids between Mediterranean and Northern European parents were able to respond to summer showers at a time when Mediterranean material was still summer dormant and Northern European material severely affected by dry summer conditions. This out-of-season growth was reflected in the higher yields of the hybrids in the autumn after the main start to the growing season. During midwinter when the Mediterranean material was growing actively the growth of Northern European material ceased and some combinations of Mediterranean and Northern European parents ceased growing. The cessation of growth was attributed to winter dormancy. Plant survival during the summer was 97% for the purely Mediterranean families, 88% for Mediterranean x Northern European families, and 59% for the purely Northern European families. Some of the Mediterranean x Northern European families survived as well as the best Mediterranean families. The potential agricultural value of the Mediterranean x Northern European hybrids and a possible breeding programme with them are discussed. © 1966 CSIRO.

Sixty-five plants of the natural intergeneric hybrid Festuca loliaceaCurt. from ten different populations were studied for morphology. Of the 55 analysed for chromosome number 24 were diploids and the rest triploids. 2. Seven diploid and eight triploid plants were investigated for chromosome behaviour in meiosis from the microsporocytes. Chromosome associations at pachytene, M I and ana I revealed cytologically detectable structural differences involving inversions, duplications, deficiencies and translocations in the parental genomes. Two triploids were asynaptic. Abnormal chromosome segregation, lagging of univalents, bivalents and trivalents, precocious division of the laggards, formation of chromatin bridges and fragments were observed at ana I. A high percentage of the microspores at tetrad stage had micronuclei; degeneration of microspores was seen to occur soon after this stage. 3. Pollen fertility for the diploids ranged from 0 to 11.9 per cent and that for the triploids less than 1 per cent to 27.9 per cent. In the triploid with two interchanges, it was the highest, being 93.3 per cent. Seed set was obtained only on open-pollination with the ryegrass parent. The back-cross plants included aneuploids with 2n=19, 20, 22 and 25 chromosomes, along with 2n=14 and 21 types. 4.

Observations on insects visiting pansy fields grown in the Netherlands for seed production made it clear that bumble-bees (Bombus spp.) and moths of Plusia gamma were the only efficient pollinators, as pansy pollen could be found on the proboscis immediately after visiting the flowers. Photographs (Fig. 2) show that the tongues of the pollinating bumble-bees are long enough to reach the nectar in the spur. Studies on the behaviour of the pollinators proved that the visiting habit shows a remarkable constancy throughout the season, as the number of flowers visited per plant did not increase with increasing numbers of flowers per plant. In about 60 per cent of the cases only one flower per plant was visited, regardless of the species of the insect. If a pollinator leaves a flower, in 40 to 45 per cent of cases it visits another flower of the same plant, while in the other cases it flies to neighbouring plants, or plants farther away. At 40 per cent of the visits self-pollination may occur between two flowers of the same plant, if no pollen of former visits is still present on the proboscis. No interspecific difference in visiting behaviour was found. Pollinating insects when undisturbed cover rather short distances.

Therefore, the developing fruit of Aesculus woerlitzensis Koehne has been investigated from pollination to maturity. The fluid, or liquid endosperm, which contains the growth-promoting substances is produced in a large vesicle which forms at the chalazal tip of the embryo sac. As the vesicle grows, it encroaches upon the nucellus and, when the embryo develops, one of its cotyledons penetrates into the vesicle of the embryo sac where it grows and absorbs the contents. The embryo, which has only a vestigial suspensor, reaches the vesicle by growing along the neck of the long curved embryo sac. The cotyledon which first penetrates the vesicle grows into a massive structure; the other remains small. The tip of the cotyledon seems to function as an absorbing surface, for the endosperm with which it comes into contact disorganizes. Fertilization and the presence of a viable embryo at the micropylar end of the embryo sac therefore sets in train a number of other events. These are the extensive development of the nucellus at the chalazal end of the embryo sac, the swelling of the vesicle and the formation of a free nuclear and some cellular endosperm, and the disorganization of the nucellus as it is encroached upon by the vesiculate embryo sac. Attention is directed to the organization of the nucellus in the vicinity of the embryo sac. Files or richly protoplasmic nucellar cells(hypostase) which converge upon the chalazal tip of the embryo sac suggest a principal route by which the vesicle may be nourished. Special attention is drawn to the very different sizes of cells, their nuclei and nucleoli, in the different parts of the nucellus. The growth and development of the embryo has also been traced from the zygote to the mature seed. The nutritive role of the veaiculate embryo sac, and the supply of growthstimulating substances, through the function of a cotyledon as an absorbing organ, are now seen as important features of the development of the Aesulus embryo in the ovule. Many outstanding problems still remain. The sequential events that follow fertilization in the different interdependent regions (nucellus, embryo sac, cotyledon, &c.) are here described, but not casually explained. © 1965 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954384635

The growth response of maize endosperm excised from immature kernels was studied in vitro, using White's medium supplemented with yeast extract. The endosperm tissue excised 9 days post-pollination generally gave best growth. 2. Of four inbred strains (two of starchy, one of waxy, and one of sugary type endosperm) of maize tested, callus tissue was formed only in the endosperm explants from the starchy strains (S41 and S42). The excised endosperm tissues of the F1 kernels obtained by the reciprocal crosses between S41 and S42 showed a better growth in vitro than those of either of the inbred parents. Histological observations of the endosperm in vivo failed to reveal any developmental or cytological differences between the F1 endosperm and the endosperms of the parental strains. 3. Among the callus tissues obtained, only those from the strain S42 and S41×S42 have been cultured successfully for three years, while other cultures ceased to grow within a few months. 4. Progeny tests of the S41×S42 hybrid suggested that the two strains could be different in two or more genetic factors concerning the callus formation in the endosperm explant, although the phenotypic expression is influenced by environmental and nutritional factors. Furthermore, the genetic study of the waxy strain S43 suggested that it possesses a genetic factor for inhibiting callus formation. 5. None of indole-3-acetic acid, kinetin, and crude extracts of established tissue cultures gave a growth promoting effect on excised endosperm tissues, whereas the amino acid components of yeast extract were found to be essential for the callus formation in the explants. © 1965, The Genetics Society of Japan.

This necesitated a pollen survey in making diagnosis of pollinosis. Therefore the pollen counts were carried out in Tokyo during 1964 and in Nikko from March to May in 1963 and 1964. Vaseline-coated slides were exposed to air for 24 hours. The results obtained were illustrated in the figures. Three pollinating seasons were observed in Tokyo. Tree season was recognised in February-May, grass season in May-November, and ragweed season in August-Septeber. Predominant pollens were Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar), Chamaecyparis obtusa, Pinaceae, Ambrosia elatior and Digitaria adscendens. In Nikko, tree season was recognised in March-May and predominant pollens were Cryptomeria japonica, Betulaceae and Pinus densiflora. The highest peak of Japanese cedar pollen count was observed in eary April with a maximum count of 70 grains in Nikko. Effects of humidity on dispersal of Japanese cedar pollen were observed. It was shown that there was a correlation between humidity and dispersal of pollens. Some clinical observations on antigenicity of pollens were carried out. b Pollen counts as a factor in the development of Japanese cedar pollinosis was studied. Some reasons for absence of pollinosis in Japan were discussed. A reason might be attributed to the lack of investigations on pollinosis in Japan.

Tolerance to CSSV was much higher in the T17 progeny than in Amelonado. Transmission rates of CMLV were much lower than of CSSV both to the T17 cuttings and to the Amelonado beans, Conditions at the time of infestation clearly affected the transmission rates. No evidence of variation in susceptibility to infection with CMLV was found in the T17 progeny.

In 1963, in the district of Nikko and its neighbourhood, the authors happened to meet 21 cases with allergic symptoms in nasal cavity, pharynx and conjunctiva, which often appear only in spring season. Based on various examinations, the authors confirm that these cases are pollinosis sensitized with Japanese cedar (Cryptameria japonica D. Don.) pollen. And this disease is named Japanese Cedar Pollinosis Cryptomeria japonica is a staple forest-tree and is found only in Japan. Its pollination in the vicinity of Nikko and Tokyo is seen from March to April. From 1963 to 1965, the total of numbers of patients reached 28 cases. The number of the patients increases most at the beginning of April, around when, the number of Japanese cedar pollens dispersed in the air increases most. The results investigated into allergens in these cases are as follows ; Prick test with Japanese cedar pollen showed positive results in 78.6% of the total of 28 cases.

Analysis of pollen from the proboscidial fossa showed that corbicular pollens alone do not give a reliable indication of the constancy of bees. The number of pollen species found in the corbiculae depended on the type of foraging area; this number varied between some Bombus species; possible reasons for this are discussed. Evidence is given that pollen-gathering bees may collect only nectar from some flowers during one trip, and that bees may be less constant between than within trips. Some nectar gatherers carried pollen in their fossae, and may therefore be of some importance in pollination. © 1965 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040450576

Effect of some activators and inhibitors and the activity of succinic dehydrogenase have been studied. There appears to be an intimate correlation between respiration and the anatomical changes in the ovule. There is an increased oxygen uptake during or immediately preceding the events of (a) pollination, (b) divisions of the endosperm nuclei, (c) cell wall formation in the endosperm, and (d) elongation of cotyledons. The activity of succinic dehydrogenase follows a curve essentially similar to that of oxygen uptake. The low intensity of respiration during certain period of development appears not to be due to exhaustion of endogenous substrates. Endogenous substrates do, however, appear to be limiting on the days when maximum respiration occurs since added sugar does significantly enhance oxygen uptake. The results with two inhibitors, iodoacetate and fluoroacetate, suggest the operation of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle during the earlier phase of seed development when the rate of growth is highest. © 1965 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0013679138

The rhythms of flowering, pollen presentation, stigma opening and nectar secretion were investigated and the amount and concentration of the nectar measured. The flower sizes and insect sizes were compared, and proved that Bombus lucorum workers and queens, and B. agrorum workers and queens, were unable to reach the bottom of the corolla tube of Digitalis lutea. Bombus lucorum chiefly chose this species as nectar seeped along the lower side of the corolla to heights which it could reach (see addendum). The other species had no mechanical barrier to full exploitation of the nectar by B. lucorum and B. agrorum. B. agrorum preferentially worked Digitalis ambigua in early summer and D. lanata later. This paper describes observations made over two seasons, in both natural and glasshouse conditions. The full significance of much of the data cannot yet be evaluated but a tentative assessment of the significance of bee visits for pollination and hybridization is given.

These characters have probably developed by way of many, small, additive mutations. Such adaptive and diagnostic characters as the presence or absence of spurs, straight or curved spurs, positioning of the flowers, either nodding or erect, and the flower pigmentation are dependent on one or only few pairs of allelomorphs. These characters of apparently basic importance in the choice of pollinators, have originated as a result of single mutations, with big phenotypic effects. If in the ancestral, spurless form of Aquilegia such a morphological change arose, as the introduction of a spur, this could have given the beginning to a new line of evolution. Such a single mutation has presumably caused the immediate formation of a flower type isolated from the rest of the population by its different pollination mechanism. The pollinators selective for the different mutations played in the evolution of the genus Aquilegia a decisive role. The original ancestral form, which gave a beginning to the whole genus, was a form similar to the relic taxon A. ecalcarata now growing in Asia. On the basils of knowledge about the evolution of the pollination mechanisms, the geographic distribution of the taxa of the genus Aquilegia and on the basis of the results of a progeny analysis, it can be assumed that from the distinguished complexes of species within this genus, the most primitive is the ecalcarata complex. Nearest 'to it in affinity appear to be the taxa of the vulgaris and alpina complexes, whereas 'the complexes canadensis amd caerulea are much less related to it, but appear to be closely related to each other.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983395674

From embryo growth analyses it was observed that, in most cases, the irradiations did not slow down the embryo growth rate, but rather increased it over control values, depending on the stages irradiated and the exposure administered. It was found that the increase in embryo size was related to a greater number of cells. However, a retardation in the rate of embryo development occurred in practically every treatment between the eighth and eleventh day after pollination. Clear differences have been found between the zygote irradiations delivered in 16 and 4 hr; the former generally induced a greater damage to the developing embryo than the latter.

These plants show no obvious phenotypic differences from their 14 chromosome sibs. Three types of meiotic pairing were found amongst 7 monosomic strains: 4 bivalents+chain of 4+univalent, 3 bivalents+chain of 4+chain of 3, and 2 bivalents+one heteromorphic rod bivalent+ring of 4+chain of 3. All are basically translocation heterozygotes of a peculiar kind composed of two genomes, one with 6, the other with 7 chromosomes. Both genomes can be transmitted through pollen and eggs, but because of the nature of the meiotic divisions, gametes with 6 chromosomes are in functional excess. Self-pollination of 5 of the monosomic strains does not give 12 chromosome ""nullisomic"" progeny. The nullisomics produced by the other 2 strains are weaker and later flowering than their 13 or 14 chromosome sibs, and are partially or completely sterile. The 6 chromosome genomes are hence usually inviable when homozygous. Crosses of the monosomics to a standard cytological strain, and intercrosses between monosomic strains, have allowed analysis of the end arrangements of chromosomes. Six different 7-chromosome genomes and 3 different 6-chromosome genomes have been identified. The translocation scheme proposed to account for the origin of the 6-chromosome genomes involves partition of most of the genetic material of one chromosome amongst two others plus the loss of a small centromere-bearing chromosome. This loss accounts for the lethality of the 6-genomes when homozygous. The fact that vigorous, healthy nullisomics are formed whenever two monosomics of different geographical origin are crossed indicates that the 3 monosomic genomes have had an independent origin, since they obviously complement one another's genetic deficiencies. The hybrid nullisomics are fairly fertile, and if formed in nature might serve as the starting point for a new race or species with a reduced basic chromosome number. © 1964 Martinus Nijhoff.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250602845

However, the material developed appeared not to be good enough in practice. Therefore the project has been tackled once more, since through the present shortage of labour in the areas of cultivation the growing of caraway might present difficulties. Studies concerning its flower biology confirmed that caraway can be easily inbred so that a breeding programme can be simplified considerably.

M. as a forest tree by increasing the rate of growth, improving wood quality, and increasing resistance to damage by fire. Improvement may be accomplished in three ways:(1) provenance trials (to determine the best place to collect seed for afforestation in a given location), (2) selection of individual trees within the chosen provenance, and (3) hybrids with species with greater resistance to fire and the ability to grow on poor sites. The major part of the work has been the provenance trials which show continuous genetic variation with altitude on the south eastern side of Mount Erica, Victoria. Seed for the trials was collected in October 1959 from 68 trees on Mount Erica. with an average of 10 trees at each of seven altitudes from 1200 feet to 3250 feet. Studies were made of capsule size, germination, cotyledon area, and growth of seedlings in the nursery. Sixty-four open pollinated progenies were planted in a cubic lattice design in the Strzelecki Ranges at 1650 feet, and some smaller trials were planted at other places. Field measurements at two years of age and again at three years confirmed the trend shown in the nursery that seedlings from higher altitudes grew more slowly. Leaf shape also varied with altitude but survival of seedlings did not. A study of the relation of nursery measurements to field measurements showed promise of a technique for culling the slowest growing progenies in the nursery without the need for field planting all the progenies. An examination of growth rates of progenies from a given altitude showed that large dominant trees rarely produced the fastest growing seedlings, consequently trees selected for breeding should not be simply the largest individuals but rather the parents which give the best progeny in nursery and field trials. Experiments were commenced on the value for forestry of hybrids of E. regnans and some observations were made on seed production. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945596871

S. A., Canada and Japan. Analysis has been made of several factors. which might be concerned with the frequency of monosomics. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Contrary to the expectation, over-all frequency of monosomics in self-pollinated progenies was lower than in cross-pollinated ones. This tendency was most pronounced in monosomics of homoeologous group 1. Poorer viability of monosomic embryos of pure monosomic lines than that of hybrids was assumed to be the cause. 2. In general, frequencies of monosomics observed in America and Japan were the same. However, mono-5 A showed an extremely high transmission rate of monosomic condition in Japan. 3. The monosomic frequency significantly differed among 21 monosomic lines. Mono-6 B showed the lowest frequency (57.3%) and mono-5 A the highest (81.9%). Frequencies of the other monosomics were intermediate. 4. Monosomics belonging to the same homoeologous group showed in general similar frequencies. Homoeologous group 1 (79.5% except mono-1 B), 6 (77.8% except mono-6 B) and 3 (76.3%) are characterized by high and group 2 (67.1%) by low transmission rate. The other three groups had an intermediate frequency. 5. Three monosomics showed a deviation in the frequency from those of the two other monosomics belonging to the same homoeologous group. The frequencies of mono-1 B and -6 B were low and that of mono-5 A was high. Low frequencies of the former two are probably correlated to the localization of the nucleolus-organizing region on chromosomes 1 B and 6 B. High frequency of mono-5 A might be related to the speltoid character, for which chromosome 5 A is responsible. 6. High correlation was found between the frequency of monosomics and both seed-setting percentage and germination rate. No correlation was detected between the former and either chromosome length, frequency of pollen tetrads with micronuclei or frequency of chromosome-deficient male gametes. This result indicates that the transmission rate of monosomic condition is mainly determined by the viability of monosomic embryos. © 1964, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Self-compatibility tests were made in an air-conditioned greenhouse using the decapitation technique. Sixty-three percent of the plants were female fertile and 77% were male fertile.

Development of the floral parts occurs in acropetal succession. The wall of the anther is composed of three layers of cells. The tapetum is of secretory type with binucleate cells. The endothecial layer develops fibrous thickenings and with the epidermis forms the mature anther wall. The pollen grains are polycolporate, three?celled at the time of shedding and the majority of them germinate in situ. The ovary is superior and bilocular with a single anatropous bitegmic ovule in each locule. The embryo?sac develops according to the Polygonum type. The flowers are autogamous and the process of pollination is described. The endosperm is free nuclear to begin with but later becomes cellular. The embryo development follows the Asterad type as in other members of Polygalaceae. Most of the endosperm is used up by the growing embryo. The two?layered seed?coat is organized by the outer integument of the ovule. The present observations are discussed with other relevant literature. Copyright © 1964, Wiley Blackwell.

In a valley of the hilly neighborhood of Misima, a spontaneous polyhaploid plant (2n=21) of the species was found. It was smaller than the hexaploid strains, but its tillering was very vigorous. In natural condition it yielded two seeds which were assumed to have been produced by pollination with the pollen of hexaploid plants growing in its proximity. The two seeds gave two plants, one a monosomic (2n=41) and the other a disomic (2n=42). Pollen fertility of the polyhaploid, the monosomic and the disomic was 0.001, 28.5 and 78.5%, and seed fertility was 0, 53.3 and 76.6%, respectively. The polyhaploid was crossed by the disomic and by two hexaploid strains, and the crossing success amounted to 0.7-1.6/. As to chromosome pairing at MI of PMCs, the polyhaploid showed 21I in 84% and 1II+19I in 14% of 442 cells observed. In the majority of cells chromosome pairing in the monosomic was 20II+1I. From the result it is concluded that Ag. tsukushiense var. transiens is an allohexaploid whose genome constitution comprises three different genomes. Summarizing the cytological studies of polyhaploids in Agropyron, the types of polyploidy in this genus are assumed to be various and complex. © 1964, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Rapid development of cones began at March of the next year, three months before fertilization (Fig. 1), and non-pollinated cones (parthenocarpy) also developed at the same time (Fig. 4). Rapid development of cones did not occur as the result of fertilization, but seemed to be closely connected with winter bud development. Physical characterization and nitrogen distribution of cones after fertilization are given in Figs. 5~8. Nitrogen of cone scales increased to the middle of July, and then decreased as the formation of seeds proceeded (Fig. 7). Cone scales seemed to be the reserve tissues of nutritive substances transferred from leaves and branches to seeds. Cone scale development began before seed formation, but declined by the deficiency of sound seed yields (Fig. 10). Cone scales however developed even in case of non-pollination (Fig. 11), so cone drop and cone scale development seemed to be induced by the effect of other factors different from fertilization and seed formation. © 1964, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

Geology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States","Information about modern pollen deposition is needed to interpret fluctuations in the postglacial pollen record in mountain regions. Thirty-five samples of surficial water-laid sediment and moss were collected in the vicinity of Durango and Silverton, Colorado, from sites ranging between 6850 and 12,600 feet above sea level. The regional differences in pollen concentration are not clearly shown when, as is the common practice, the pollen taxa are expressed as percentages of the total pollen at each site. Various site factors can obscure existing trends. Pollen concentrations in surface samples are most easily compared by examining ratios determined by the frequencies of only two pollen types in the sample. The effect of other pollen is thus excluded. Three ratios are examined utilizing combinations of pine (Pinus), spruce (Picea), oak (Quercus), and sage-brush or wormwood (Artemisia) pollen. These taxa are easily identified and comprise the bulk of the pollen in the samples. The ratios Picea/Pinus, Artemisia/Quercus, and Pinus/Quercus exhibit linear trends when plotted against elevation on semilogarithmic paper; their relations to elevation can be approximated by exponential functions. Several factors affect the value of a ratio. For example, the Picea/Pinus ratio depends upon: (1) elevation (and the control that the moisture and temperature regime exerts on vegetation); (2) density of the surrounding forests; (3) size of the basin in which the pollen accumulates; and (4) statistical variation associated with random counting errors. The highest values of Artemisia pollen, released late in the flowering season, were found in sediments of cirque lakes above timber line. The cirque lakes remain frozen until midsummer, overflow with meltwater until late in the pollination season, and then become standing bodies of water until the fall freeze. The cirque lake sediments are deficient in early-season pollen. The logarithm of certain pollen ratios may be correlated with elevation because environmental factors associated with elevation control the distribution of the plants in mountain regions. If the elevations of the vegetation zones varied in the past because of different climatic conditions, the ratios of the taxa at any one site would be expected to change and indicate an ""apparent elevation"" different from the present. Study of the apparent changes in elevation of a site in the Animas Valley region, based on variations in the pollen ratios of its post-glacial sediments, may provide evidence of past climate fluctuation. © 1963, The Geological Society of America, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000190794

It was found that the mutant, besides the abnormal subdivision of leaf, deviates from the normal type by having taller stems and a greater assimilating leaf surface. Significant difference between the two types in yield could not be established. In a seed progeny of the subdivided-leaf mutant after open pollination, twenty-nine out of forty-nine seedlings showed subdivision of leaf. It was concluded that the mutation, which caused the leaf subdivision, embraces the subepidermal layer; but the question whether the subdivided-leaf mutant is a monochlamyde or a dichlamyde chimaera could not be answered. The anatomic and genetic response of the subdivided-leaf mutant to ionizing radiation was studied in an X-ray experiment. Fifty tuber-halves were treated with a dose of 4,000 r at the advanced stage of germination while the corresponding tuber-halves served as controls. Forty plants of the X-irradiated plants emerged. Five of these plants exhibited from one to three normal shoots. Moreover, in one instance, a few leaves were observed one half of which were subdivided and the other normal. Tubers from 24 vX1 plants were obtained and planted in the following year. Two plants, which had normal shoots in the vX1 generation, produced normal plants in the vX2 generation; and one plant, which had subdivided leaves in the vX1 generation, produced a vX2 plant bearing three normal shoots and two shoots with subdivided leaves. On the basis of this experiment it was stated that X-ray treatment is an easy and efficient method for disclosing the periclinal structure of somatic mutants in potatoes. In the vX2 generation, five aberrant types occurred all of which maintained the subdivided-leaf character distinctly in combination with the new induced character. This frequency of induced aberrations is in accordance with those previously recorded in the normal type of the variety. © 1963.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749218323

It appears from this comparison that the most primitive floral patterns, derived from the radiate symmetrical arrangement of cycad leaves, evolved during the early Mesozoic era on various cycadeoid plants. The phaneranthous plants, the differentiation of primitive floral patterns took place by a recombination of sporophylls and certain cauline leaves into showy flowers, whereas aphananthous plants retained their less showy sporophylls in the foreground. Later on, these elementary flower patterns were transmitted to the early angiosperms and subsequently continued to evolve and specialize in higher flowering plants. From the review of paleontological material and other available evidence, it appears that the pre-Cretaceous era initiated the formation of phaneranthous flower types. Three main type-classes: amorphic, haplomorphic (paleomorphic), and actinomorphic, have been successively differentiated during this long era which might have lasted about 100 million years or more. It is assumed that the beginning of insect pollination and the evolution of phaneranthous flower types might have originated in the Middle Triassic period with flowers like Sturianthus, some 200 million years ago. For about 80 million years, these insects were associated mainly with the Bennettitales; for the next 60 million years, with the Bennettitales and early angiosperms; and, during the last 60 millions, they worked12 mainly with the angiosperms.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33947482590

During the Mankato phase that followed, the Des Moines lobe advanced to within a few miles of the sites. The region today is in a mixed-oak forest, with a maplebasswood forest 15 miles to the west and a re-entrant of the prairie on the sand plain south of the moraine. The general limit of coniferous trees is about 50 miles northeast of the sites, although outliers, especially of Pinus strobus, may be found along the Mississippi Valley a few miles to the east. One sediment core 12-13 m long from each site was analyzed for pollen content at 5-25-cm intervals. Diagrams based on percentage of total pollen (trees, shrubs, wind-pollinated herbs) show essentially identical sequences at the two sites, starting with the late-glacial phase of ice retreat. The diagrams have been subdivided into pollen zones according to the A-B-C sequence introduced by Deevey for New England. The late-glacial pollen record starts at Kirchner Marsh with a short Picea-Cyperaceae-Gramineae phase (Zone K), believed to represent a spruce parkland. Its C-14 date of 13,270 BP and the stratigraphy indicate a pre-Two Creeks and post- Gary correlation. Apparently the Kirchner site did not become established as a lake until this time owing to persistence of dead ice in the moraine. The absence of pollen of specific tundra indicators and the presence of pollen of such thermophilous plants as Fraxinus, Quercus, Corylus, Ambrosia, Humulus, and Typha latifolia imply that the climate was cool rather than cold. Zone A-a, which follows, correlates with the Two Creeks interstade. It is marked by the dominance of Picea, with appreciable percentages of Fraxinus and Ambrosia and with minor amounts of other thermophilous plants and the normal boreal associates of spruce like Betula, Larix, and Salix. Zone A-b, starting 12,050 C-14 years ago, correlates with the Valders ice advance. It is represented at both Kirchner and Carlson and shows the withdrawal of Fraxinus and Ambrosia and the slight rise of Artemisia. Except for the absence of pine in the late-glacial assemblage the vegetation implied by these three zones seems to have its closest modern counterpart in the southern fringe of the Boreal Forest of the Riding Mountain region of southwest Manitoba. It is concluded that pine did not migrate southward with the spruce during the Wisconsin glaciation, at least in the western Great Lakes region, and was thus eliminated from this region. During the lateglacial phases of ice retreat, herbs and spruce pioneered on the deglaciated terrain; pine did not follow until the destruction of the spruce forest at the end of the late-glacial phase. Zone B introduces postglacial time. It represents the time of rapid Vegetational succession following the deterioration of the spruce forest. Simultaneous maxima of Betula, Alnus, Fraxinus, and Abies occurred 10,230 years ago at Kirchner Marsh. These were followed rapidly by a Pinus maximum and then a rise of Ulmus, Quercus, and other deciduous types, dated as 9300 years ago at the correlative site of Madeha. This succession may represent differential rates of migration from refuges south and east of Minnesota. Deciduous trees dominate the C Zones. Zone C-a shows Ulmus and Ostrya /Carpinus followed by Quercus; it probably represents principally a mesic maple-basswood forest changing to oak. Zone C-b represents the advance of prairie into the region at the expense of the oak woodland or savanna. The large and abrupt fluctuations in the curves for Ambrosia-type and Chenopodiineae, especially at the Carlson site, may record encroachment of annual weeds onto intermittently dried lake bottoms. C-14 dates place Zone C-b between 7100 and 5100 years ago. In Zone C-c the Quercus again dominates until the abrupt increase in Ambrosiatype and Chenopodiineae that marks the time of forest clearance and land settlement 50-75 years ago. © 1963, The Geological Society of America, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000690503

In young endosperms of Trillium and Paris, the mitoses were synchronised. A comparison of the number of mitoses, determined from the number of nuclei, which had taken place in the first 5 weeks after controlled pollination within and between 10 species of Trillium and 2 of Paris, revealed that the rate of endosperm development varied according to the relationship of the plants used. 2. (i) Trillium species were self-sterile, although, in a few cases, slowly developing endosperms formed and later degenerated. (ii) Within species cross-pollinations of Trillium plants gave rise to rapidly growing regular endosperms in which at least 8 synchronised mitoses had occurred in 5 weeks. (iii) After inter-specific cross-pollination, endosperms developed more slowly and frequently showed nuclear abnormalities. These were particularly frequent in endosperms formed by crossing the Japanese T. kamtschaticum with the American T. grandiflorum. No viable hybrid seed was formed. 3. The results of reciprocal crosses between the more distantly related Trillium species differed, but in most cases the endosperm was more retarded than after crossing closely related species. 4. Mitotic abnormalities, which were not restricted to the most slowly developing hybrid Trillium endosperms, included bridges, acentric fragments, lagging chromosomes, ""stickiness"", irregular disjunction, micronuclei, giant polymorphic nuclei, and aneuploidy. 5. After crosses within and between Trillium species, 5 wholly or partially aneuploid endosperms were observed. In each case, one maternal chromosome, either B, C, D, or E but not the large A chromosome, was missing or extra. 6. Paris quadrifolia was self- and cross-fertile. When hybridised with Trillium grandiflorum or T. cernuum, it produced no viable seed but when used as the female parent it formed endosperm which, in spite of nuclear abnormalities, developed fairly rapidly for a few weeks. The reciprocal crosses resulted in very little endosperm production. 7. Differences in the rate of development between reciprocal crosses of distantly related species indicate a strong chromosomal control. Failure to form normal endosperms is due to the interacting influence of the paternal genome introduced by the foreign pollen. The degree of interaction depends on how dissimilar the two genomes are and how strongly the male parent is represented in the hybrid nuclei. When the paternal genome is greatly outnumbered by the maternal ones, as in Paris quadrifolia × Trillium (PPPPT) endosperms, development is more rapid than when both are equally represented, as in Trillium x Paris quadrifolia (TTPP) endosperms. © 1963 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006842939

All three cauliflower types set similar amounts of seed upon artificial self-pollination, but the autumn and winter cauliflowers exhibited a ""facultative self-incompatibility"" by their ability to set more seed following mixed-pollination with self and Brussels sprout pollen. The percentage of hybrids in the progenies from the mixedpollinations were-summer cauliflowers 18.2, autumn cauliflowers 57.1, and winter cauliflowers 71.9. These results were similar to those found after natural cross-pollination. Calculations of the percentage of hybrid seeds in each quarter of the siliqua showed that the ratio of hybrid: self seeds was the same in all quarters of the siliqua, indicating that restrictions of pollen tube growth in these cauliflower types is confined to the stigmatic surface. It is suggested that the annual type summer cauliflowers were derived from biennial types by constant selection of a small number of plants for uniformity and quality which has led to self-compatibility as a correlated response. It is also suggested that under similar intense selection self-compatibility may possibly be attained in the autumn and winter types. © 1963 H Veenman En Zonen N.

Regular twice weekly sprays with various concentrations of 2-naphthoxyacetic acid at concentrations between 50 and 5oop.p.m. were also combined with the maleic hydrazide treatments. Observations were made on the development and final weight of all fruits, and values obtained for the percentages of achenes in which there were viable embryos at maturity. Achenes treated with maleic hydrazide at various intervals were examined to determine the effects of the treatment on the development of the embryo, endosperm, and nucellus.

Viability decreased as drying time increased but viable grains were obtained in greater numbers after two days than after drying for a single day. Germination of pollen in vitro was better at 30° C and 35° C than at other temperatures tried; media with high gelatine concentrations (30%) seemed superior to those with less gelatine. For normal breeding purposes storage of pollen for two or three months is adequate. At low temperature, reliable storage in sealed ampoules for at least this period was obtained after further drying pollen over silica gel. Some samples retained good viability for considerably longer. Most samples stored over silica gel were still viable after 5 months, though viability was low. Over damp CaCl2 considerable reduction in viability occurred during the first month but there was little further reduction at least up to 7 months after collection, and all samples were still viable after 18 months. Freeze-dried pollen in ampoules under vacuum had up to 40% viability after storage for one year. At room temperature, viability of pollen kept at controlled humidities over sulphuric acid solutions, though retained for longer periods than in an uncontrolled atmosphere, was only reliably maintained for about three weeks; some samples remained viable for longer periods. Freeze-drying was found to greatly increase the longevity of pollen kept at room temperature; freeze-dried pollen used in a trial shipment to New Guinea retained viability for four months and was successfully used in a number of controlled pollinations. © 1963 H.

With a variety of Potentilla species as pollen plants, crossing experiments yield progenies, which, except for the occasional aberrant, are uniform and resemble the female parent in morphology. Embryological preparations show meiosis to be suppressed in all topodemes. In all except one topodeme, the majority of unreduced embryo sacs are diplosporous in origin, in the other they are predominantly aposporous. Although the egg cell is capable of autonomous parthenogenetic development, functional seed is never formed without previous pollination. The conclusion to be drawn from embryology and crossing experiments is therefore that the seed produced is almost completely pseudogamous, thereby reproducing faithfully the genotype of the parent. The topodeme from Fleam Dyke, Cambridge, differed from the others investigated in a number of important respects. These included chromosome number, male sterility, the origin of unreduced embryo sacs and the precocious development of parthenogenetic embryos. Copyright © 1963, Wiley Blackwell.

Purely vegetative spread seems to be very restricted, and populations consist of discrete individuals, presumably established from seed. The mechanisms involved in reproduction by seed have been investigated in three Scottish topodemes. Crosses between P. crantzii as female parent and P. tabernaemontani, P. arenaria and P. aurea as pollen plants yielded progenies which were quite uniform and which resembled P. crantzii morphologically. The mechanism of maternal inheritance in representatives of these topodemes has been elucidated cytologically. Plants from Ben Lawers and Inchnadamph differed significantly in their embryology from P. tabernaemontani previously investigated. Female meiosis was observed in all stages, but the products degenerated without exception and unreduced embryo sacs arose by diplospory. In the third topodeme from Creag an Dail, there was no sign of meiosis beyond the synapsis stage and embryo?sacs were aposporous in origin. No plants produced seed without prior pollination. Although, in emasculated flowers, the autonomous division of the egg cell formed embryos, endosperm was always lacking. The continued development of embryos is dependent on endosperm and consequently no mature seed is produced. One chromosome count in endosperm after pollination suggests that endosperm formation is the result of a genuine fertilization rather than merely stimulation by the pollen.

The endosperm was free nuclear up to 17-18 days after pollination and then became cellular. 3. The endosperm showed, especially at the free nuclear stage, a significant disparity in the size of its nuclei. The ranges in length and breadth of nuclei in 18 day old endosperm were 27.28 to 153.00 microns and 20.40 to 68.00 microns, respectively. 4. Endopolyploidy, aneuploidy, multipolarity of spindles, chromosomal bridges and nuclear fusions were responsible for the variation present in the size and shape of endosperm nuclei. 5. The normal cytological constitution of the endosperm was determined as triploid with 3n=33 chromosomes. 6. A study of the nucleolar numbers and chromosome counts of the endosperm and root tip nuclei has revealed that the number of nucleoli per nucleus cannot be used as an indicator of polyploidy in Amaryllis belladonna. 7. Breakdown of the endosperm was possibly caused by the cumulative effect of mitotic aberrations which were apparent in the form of bridges, multipolarity of spindles, polyploidy and aneuploidy. The frequency of the occurrence of mitotic abnormalities was found to be significantly higher in the collapsing endosperm. © 1963, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

New cytological data are presented for Embothrium (South American), Beauprea (New Caledonian), and 15 Australian genera which are mostly tropical or subtropical and with morphological characters considered primitive. Beauprea, Buckinghamia, Opisthiolepis, Embothrium, Oreocallis, and Strangea have 2n = 22 and this number is also confirmed for Stenocarpus and Lomatia. Hollandaea, Darlingia, Cardwellia, Carnarvonia, Helicia, Hicksbeachia, Gevuina, Musgravea, and Austromuellera have 2n = 28. In all these cases the chromosomes are comparable in size with those previously described in Grevillea and other genera. Placospermum has 2n=14 and its chromosomes are many times larger, comparable with those which have been reported in Persoonia. The palaeobotanical evidence is discussed, but does not throw much light on the detailed phylogeny or on the origin of the family, although it suggests that Proteaceae were well developed in the Upper Cretaceous period. From comparative morphology and cytology, together with considerations of distribution, ecology, and other factors, the characters of the ancestral Proto-Proteaceae are postulated and an evolutionary scheme of probable relationships of subfamilies, tribes, and genera is put forward, but formal taxonomic rearrangement is deferred for a later publication. Morphological features of the ovule and seed and of floral orientation are discussed. The characters and probable evolutionary trends within each individual group are dealt with in detail and form the basis of a number of proposed rearrangements in the taxonomic system. Placospermum is considered to combine many primitive morphological and cytological features, and it is excluded from both the subfamilies Proteoideae and Grevilleoideae, being thought to represent an early offshoot before the differentiation of those groups. The Proteoideae are probably polyphyletic but the Grevilleoideae represent a more close-knit assemblage. Within the subfamilies certain groups consist of clearly allied genera and appear to be monophyletic. These constitute the majority of the formally recognized tribes, viz. Proteeae (here including Synaphea and Conospermum), Grevilleeae (here restricted to Finschia, Grevillea, and Hakea), Musgraveeae (Musgravea, Austromuellera), and Banksieae. The tribe Embothrieae, here restricted to those genera of the Grevilleoideae with n=11, shows considerable morphological diversity but is accepted for the present. It is shown that Strangea should be removed from the Grevilleeae and placed in the Embothrieae near Stenocarpus, with which it shares distinctive seed and inflorescence characters. Some isolated genera, viz. Orites (Grevilleoideae) and in particular Franklandia (Proteoideae), show marked specialization in many features and may be given tribal status. The other two tribes recognized, Persoonieae (in the Proteoideae) and Macadamieae (in the Grevilleoideae), consist of genera which, although advanced in certain respects, preserve numerous primitive features. Each of these tribes comprises a number of groups and individual genera which appear to be the result of evolutionary lines that have been independent from a very early stage. The African genus Brabeium, formerly placed in Persoonieae, is shown to be related to Macadamia. There remain certain genera, viz. Dilobeia (Proteoideae) and also Hollandaea, Knightia, Darlingia, Cardwellia, and Carnarvonia (Grevilleoideae), for which no formal grouping is at present suggested. The frequent independence of trends of specialization in individual characters is stressed, and the relationship of zygomorphy and other floral and inflorescence specializations to pollination by higher insects and birds is discussed. The primitive condition of the inflorescence is considered to have been essentially racemose, not a thyrse as recently suggested. Racemose inflorescences are found in many Proteoideae but the apparent raceme in Grevilleoideae is thought to be a reduced panicle. The phytogeography of the family is briefly discussed. There is evidence indicating a tropical origin, and therefore suggestions of southern connections between Australia and Africa are discounted, though they may have occurred between Australia and South America. Stress is placed on the need for an understanding of evolution within the family as a prerequisite to the development of theories on its position among the Angiosperms and on its historical phytogeography. © 1963 CSIRO.

Infected plants produced approximately twice as many inflorescences as uninfected plants at each concentration, but the addition of zinc decreased the number produced. Leaf?bronzing typical of the phyllody syndrome was greater in infected plants and increased with higher concentration, but necrotic spotting attributable to zinc toxicity was more marked in uninfected plants. Zinc at 20 p.p.m. was generally toxic. The dry weight of shoot and root decreased at the higher levels of zinc, and at a lower level with infected than with uninfected plants. Zinc content of root and shoot increased with greater concentrations in the culture solution, being higher in the roots of infected plants than of uninfected ones but less in the shoots.

Usually the bees have previously flown about freely in the open air and may have gathered pollen from the same plant species. Now the question arises whether the bees can contaminate with this pollen plants with which they are enclosed in an isolation cage. In this connection a number of experiments were undertaken to find out how long bees are loaded with germinable pollen. It appeared that the risk of contamination was practically eliminated by keeping the bees in a house or empty isolation cage for 12 hours. © 1962 H.

No pollination occurred in cages which excluded bees.

An adjustment for relative humidity may be necessary in order to compare readings widely separated in time or location. Where conditions are relatively constant from day to day, it may be sufficient to measure the nectar sugar concentration and relative humidity at the same hour each day.

A review of previous theoretical studies on partly self-pollinated plant populations was set out first. Then, the writers' computations were reported which dealt with the effects of seed dormancy and vegetative propagation on population structure, and the change in frequency of a gene controlling selfing probability. It was pointed out that the breeding system of the Perennis type of wild rice, which is partly cross-pollinated and capable of propagating vegetatively, and has seeds dormant for a long period, would be quite suitable for accumulating genetic variation in its populations. It was also suggested that selfing genes can increase by themselves unless counteracted by another force favoring heterozygotes. Therefore, if the habitat assumes conditions of cultivated fields and homozygous plants become relatively advantageous, the populations will tend toward selfing. © 1962, The Genetics Society of Japan.

The set % of pod in the plants with artifical pollination was higher than that in the plants with natural pollination in the victorial lawm, owing to the structure of flower. 4. The set % of pod in the plants with open pollination was higher than that in the artificially self pollinated plants. This was owing to the structure of flower and the highly developed abscission layers. 5. When the lateral shoot was put off the set % of pod in the main stem was high, though the number of pod was small. 6.

Cytological and embryological studies have shown that the chromosome number is 2n = 20, and that the embryo sac develops normally. Sterility is due to an incompatibility system which prevents the growth of pollen tubes into the style.A self-fertile selection has been made in which fertilization occurs 4 hr after anthesis. Fertility probably arose by mutation of an incompatibility allele. The sterile plants will readily produce seed when pollinated by clones of the fertile plant.Because P. yaguaronense possesses a sexual method of reproduction and an incompatibility system, it could be useful in future breeding work within the genus Paspalum, which contains a number of apomictic species. © 1962 CSIRO.

These have resulted not because of the microsecond arithmetic speed but because of the ability to manipulate symbols: to read, write, store, compare, and replace symbols and to follow different courses of action according to differences between symbols. Thus, language in a general sense is a common aspect of these new applications. Programmers have been extending the usefulness of computers through the evolutionary development of most artfully conceived languages. Recently, mathematicians and logicians have been proving theorems about formal languages, while linguists have been discovering laws that humans instinctively observe whenever they use natural language. Fruitful cross pollination among such endeavors now promises greatly accelerated progress in determining whether symbol manipulation is for information processing applications what numerical analysis is for arithmetic applications. This paper first reviews the evolution of programming languages from the early days when all programming was done in machine languages, through symbolic coding systems, interpreters, assemblers, generators, and compilers, to the recently developed list processing languages. Then the applications of these languages to game playing, problem solving, theorem proving, and behavior and biological modeling have been described briefly. Finally, in anticipation of extending the capability of computers to accept, use and generate natural languages, the paper concludes with an introduction to some of the contemporary work on formal language theory, including a discussion of six families of abstract languages and their practical implementation.

The trigeneric hybridization was more successful when T. vulgare × H. villosa F1 was crossed as the female to S. cereale than when the cross was made in the other direction. This situation is the same as that found in Emmer wheat-Haynaldia-Secale hybridization. 3. 55 grains of trigeneric triple F1 were sown, of which 15 grains germinated and 4 mature plants were obtained. The percentage of the number of mature triple F1 plants to the number of pollinated florets was 0.137. 4. The number of somatic chromosomes varied from 31 ~ 36 among 10 plants of TvCHRF1 (Table 1). The somatic chromosome number of eu-trigeneric triple F1 hybrids was 35. This number is the same as the sum of the gametic chromosome numbers of the three parents, T. vulgare (21), H. villosa (7) and S. cereale (7). In these trigeneric triple F1's, 7 out of the 31~ somatic chromosomes were introduced from S. cereale and the remaining 24~ 29 from TvCHF1, 2n=28). 5. The triple F1 hybrids, whose meiosis in PMC's was studied, were classified into the following 3 groups according to their somatic chromosome numbers: (a) A group having 2n=35 chromosomes: 6 individuals were included in this group, of which only one matured. At the MI of meiosis 1~7 bivalents were observed (Figs. 6~13). The frequency of the bivalents in PMC's is shown in Table 3. Almost all the bivalents consisted of 2 elements of equal size, but in a few cases heteromorphic pairs were observed. 4II appeared to be the mode (Table 3). Most of the bivalents were stick-shaped, but some of them were ring-shaped. Trivalents of V-shape were observed in addition to bivalents at MI (75 trivalents in 1, 000 PMC's) and tetravalents of N-shape were observed only in 2 cases among 1, 000 PMC's. (b) A group having 2n=31 chromosomes: 2 individuals were included in this group. At the MI of meiosis of PMC's 0~5 and 0~6 bivalents were observed with the mode of 0II (Figs. 14~19). The frequency of bivalents is shown in Table 3. Stick-shaped bivalents were commonly observed in both individuals, while ring-shaped ones were only rarely found in No. 1 individual (9 ring-shaped among 621 bivalents). Heteromorphic bivalents were also observed only in a few cases. Trivalents of V-shape were observed in rare occasions, but no tetravalents were found. (c) A group having 2n=32 chromosomes: only 1 individual was included in this group. At the MI of meiosis of PMC's 0~5 bivalents were observed (Figs. 20~24). Frequency of the bivalents is shown in Table 3, in which 0II was the mode. Almost all the bivalents were stick-shaped. Trivalents of V-shape were rarely observed, but no tetravalents were found. 6. Although a few bivalents might have been consisting of chromosomes of R or V genomes, most of the bivalents observed in the triple F1's seem to have been formed by autosyndesis between the chromosomes of AB or ABD genomes of T. vulgare used as the grandparent, according to the results of cytological investigations in F1's between Triticum and Haynaldia by Kostoff (1937), between Haynaldia and Secale by Nakajima (1951, '59), between Triticum and Secale by Nakajima (1952, '54, '56, '57, '58, '60) and between Aegilops squarrosa and Haynaldia villosa by Zennyozi (1961). © 1962, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Station, Morioka, Japan","1) A variety of wheat, Shirahada, showed an abnormal meiotic behavior, chromosome-mosaics. In every plant selected at random there were to be seen aneuploid PMC's such as hypo- or hyper- cells mixed together with euploid ones in the same anther-loculus. Especially the hypo- cells with less than 2n chromosome number were frequently noticed. Such aberrant PMC's are usually characterized by a relatively large number of unpaired chromosomes. 2) In euploid PMC's there were often observed one or two pairs of univalents while multivalent chromosomes such as trivalent or tetravalent were rarely discovered. On an average about 18% of aneuploid PMC's observed had such irregularities. Laggards and bridges were also frequently observed in both 1st and 2nd anaphase, especially so in 1st division. 3) An upset in mitosis which was induced by gene-controlled spindle abnormalities just before meiosis seems to be the probable cause of the origin of these hypo- and hyper-cells. 4) As a result of such irregularities in the meiotic division, there appeared frequently in the progenies various types of aneuploids, especially monosomics (2n=41). In the self-pollinated progenies of a plant with the lowest seed fertility, a series of aneuploids having 2n=39, 40 and 41 chromosome numbers were found together with euploids (2n=42). © 1962, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Norin 35 of paddy rice, grown in square pots, were used for this purpose. The plants were exposed to an artificial wind with varying velocities (9, 12, and 15 metres per second) for five hours on different days (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days before flowering) as shown in Table 1. 1. Strong wind at 15 days before flowering resulted in abnormal anthers of smaller than the standard anther or of irregular form (Figure 1 and Table 2). The time of this treatment seemed to be the iniation or early developing stage of anthers and it is a little earlier than the sensitive stage when the tapatum cells of anther occur in the case of cool air and cold water treatments which had been reported by Sakai (1937 and 1947) and Shimazaki (1949). 2. Abortive pollens also were the result when plants were exposed to wind at 15 days before flowering, especially at 15 metres per second as shown in Table 2. But the abortive pollens were comparatively less than the values which were imaginated from both of atrophied spikelets (Tsuboi and Hitaka; 1962) and abnormal anthers. 3. Regarding pollination and germination of pollen grains in spikelets which bloomed under normal conditions, as in the case of plants used as standard, significant differences were not found between those of treated and untreated plants (Table 3). 4. During the few days following the wind treatments, many spikelets were found to have accelerated blooming as an after effect of the treatments (Table 4), and such spikelets did not at all receive pollen grains or received only very few pollen grains on the stigmas, thereby resulting sterile kernels (Table 5). However, the pollination and pollen germination in the spikelets which bloomed at the normal times did not differ so much from those of standard plants. 5. Wind treatments before the heading or flowering stage resulted in the occurrence of discoloured dead and empty grains and in the reduction of the proportion in the formation of complete grains. The most harmful effect on ripening was recognized when the spikelets were exposed to wind just at the flowering date, as reported already by many investigators Matsuo (1942), Togari (1940), Tsuboi and Hitaka (1958) and etc. (Table 6). 6. The colour of the glumes changed from normal to brown or grey when the plants were exposed to strong winds at the flowering stage, because the spikelets received physical bruises or rubs and physiological dessication by the wind treatments. The grains in discoloured glumes became coloured under the drying conditions caused by the kernels not being locked perfectly by the inner and outer glumes, as suggested by Tsuboi (1961) and may be easily attacked by fungus as reported by Matsuo (1942). Influence of discoloured glumes on the occurrence of coloured grains was about 3.5 times larger in the case of discoloured grey than in the case of discoloured brown (Table 7). © 1962, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Stamen pattern is useful for studying the Pomoideae and Prunoideae, and strawberries. It may sometimes be used as an additional diagnostic character. The role of polyploidy as it affects the distribution of cultivated apples and cherries in Britain is considered in relation to other factors, such as fertility and frost damage. The genic and environmental relations of flowering time in raspberry, and the genetics of the raspberry plant wild in Britain are stated. There is no recognisable cline of the biometrical characters. The more important biometrical characters used in raspberry breeding are evaluated: seedlings with the best general biometrical assessment usually prove to be the higher yielders. Variation in apomictic blackberries has been investigated, especially concerning auto-segregation, and the term subsexual reproduction illustrated. The vigour of apomictic progenies, termed pseudo-gamous heterosis, depends on the pollen parent. Correlated responses follow the intense selection of an apomictic species: selection for prickle intensity produces a change in leaf shape reminiscent of other species closely related taxonomically. The pollination milieu of blackberries has also been examined. Graphical analyses are considered as useful visual aids when attempting to assess segregations in sexualapomictic progenies. The distribution of blackberries in Britain may have been influenced by the extent of previous glaciation: the greatest diversity of Rubus species is in south-east England, adjacent to the ice-free Continent. Attention is drawn to the practical values of these discoveries. © 1962 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250947292

As a result, many dwarf strains yield homogeneous progenies and they can be used with advantage for identifying the most pre-potent males1.

Therefore we tried to determine the activity of an enzyme preparation from Penicillium spinulosum Thom, on cutin preparations of several sources and especially on stigma cutin isolated from about 10,000 stigmata of black mustard by shaking with pectinase solution following the method in ref. 4, and treatment with ethanol.

From this it is clear that cutin from mustard stigma is attacked more than material from the pistil of Petunia and much more than cutin from leaves and fruits. The breakdown is measured by titration of the enzymically liberated fatty acids following a new method5. The differences in enzymic decomposition of cutin should depend on a specific state or a special composition of the high-polymeric, reticular substrate.

Consequently, natural selection acting through heterozygote advantage and differential competing ability has often sufficient plasticity in the genetic composition to mould into better adaptive types. Whether fitness and agronomic productivity of a bulk population are improved simultaneously would depend upon the relationship between the two genetic systems governing them. In case of a linear correlation such as one observed in the barley material studied, the bulk method seems to be quite promising, particularly in view of the great economy in cost and labour involved in the entire program. Another important feature is, at least on theoretical grounds, the greater stability in the performance of a mixed population owing to a wider adaptive base against different environments, or such adverse factors as a coevolving group of some pathogenic races. However, it appears that progress under natural selection is perhaps too slow and therefore, artificial selection might also be resorted to at suitable stages in the bulk program on the basis of usual testing and evaluating procedures. Isolation of superior familial lines by the F10 or F15 generation followed by their separate bulk propagation might prove an efficient scheme. © 1961 H.

It is suggested that one of the functions of pollination, or fertilization, is to remove this inhibition and make the tissues susceptible to stimulation by growth substances produced either by the parent plant or the fertilized carpels.Receptacles in which pollination is confined to a single carpel swell only around the point of insertion of that carpel, and no swelling occurs beneath neighbouring unfertilized carpels. Likewise, after treatment of the plant with gibberellic acid swelling of fruit tissue occurred only at the base and did not extend into areas occupied by unfertilized carpels.Parthenocarpic fruits were produced in two ways; both depended on the sup-pression of carpel development on the receptacle. In one case, modification of the plants' environment resulted in the production of leafy bracts in place of carpels. In the other, carpel development was specifically inhibited by applications of maleic hydrazide at the time of carpel formation.When carpels were only partially suppressed swelling occurred only in areas either free of carpels or occupied by fertilized carpels, never in areas occupied by unfertilized carpels. © 1961 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745749244

On the first day after pollination the amount of these sugars in the apical style parts was higher in non-pollinated flowers, while on the other hand, in most cases it was lower in the basal sections and ovaries than in the corresponding parts of pollinated flowers. During the next two days there was a greater loss of both carbohydrates where pollination, particularly allogamy, occurred, so that after the third day the glucose and fructose level was highest in the non-pollinated pistils and lowest after compatible pollination. This decrease was most pronounced in the ovaries even though the compatible tubes had not yet penetrated into them. In experiments in which the flowers were left on plants cultivated under field conditions, a decrease in the glucose and fructose content of their pistils had not occurred even 80 hours after compatible pollination. From these facts the following conclusions can be drawn: The growth of the tubes through the styles causes an increased inflow of carbohydrates into the whole pistils. Both compatible and incompatible tubes use sugars from the style tissue. Both these phenomena are more intense after allogamy than in the case of incompatible autogamy. In view of the fact that compatible tubes grew normally through the styles even with a lowered glucose and fructose level, an absolute rise in the content of these sugars in the pistils is not necessary for tube growth. The proportion of glucose/fructose in pollinated styles changes in favour of glucose. The value of this quotient rises both in the apical and basal style parts mainly, however, after compatible pollination. This phenomena is in agreement with the previous hypothesis (TUPý 1959, 1960), according to which, in the respiratory process, pollen tubes consume mainly sucrose and from this, primarily its fructofuranose component. © 1961 Institute of Experimental Botany.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52449136177

This has been demonstrated in the cases of alanine, valine, leucine-isoleucine, serine, threonine, ?-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, glutamic acid and proline. These changes take place mainly in the parts of the style where the pollen tubes are present. The most marked changes are an increase in the level of ?-aminobutyric acid and alanine and a decrease in glutamic acid. The intensity of these processes is much greater following compatible pollination than in the case of incompatible autogamy. On the assumption that the main course of ?-aminobutyric acid and alanine katabolism takes place by transamination with ?-ketoglutaric acid, the basic nature of the above changes is explained as being due to a relative deficiency of the latter acid. Alongside a reduction in the level of sugars an accumulation of asparagine takes place in pollinated styles. The rise in its level is considerably more rapid in cross-pollinated than in self-pollinated styles. If accumulation of asparagine is a result of more intensive consumption of proteins during respiration when there is a scarcity of sugars, it follows from the above results as from previous work (TUPý 1961), that pollen tubes use substrates from the style tissues for respiration and that this process is limited in the case of incompatible inhibition. At the time when the pollen tubes are growing through the styles, the levels of ?-aminobutyric acid and alanine are already rising in the ovaries of pollinated flowers. This increase is quantitatively in direct ratio to the rate of pollen tube growth, which depends on the compatible or incompatible character of the pollination. © 1961 Institute of Experimental Botany.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-52449136377

Two methods of recording insect pollination in relation to the numbers of seed set per head of clover were explored in 1955. In 1956 and 1957 recording of actual crops of seed was continued. Certain species of humble?bees are important in the production of singlecut red clover seed, and in the production of doublecut red clover seed in 1956, although another factor, possibly honey?bees, was dominant in 1957. There was no indication that robbing was associated with a lower seed set; on the contrary in 1957 it was associated with a higher set, possibly because it attracted honey?bees to the crop. The data showed that the numbers of the different species of humble?bees varied, but gave no indication of the relative effectiveness of the various species in pollination. Those present in greatest numbers were of most value for pollinating red clover. Pests and diseases likely to reduce seed set were found to be negligible during 1955, 1956 and 1957.

These fruits set few plump and viable seeds, but some small and empty seeds were obtained in numbers clearly inversely proportional to the amount of irradiation doses. Only six plump seeds were obtained in 537 fruits fertilized with irradiated pollen grains and five of them germinated. All of them had the normal number of chromosomes (2n = 24) of L. pimpinellifolium. No difference on biological effects between X- and gamma-irradiation was recognized in the present experiment. © 1961, The Genetics Society of Japan.

The pollen is then transferred to the ear shoot in a manner to thoroughly pollinate the silks and left until harvest time. This method can be replaced by using a tube to connect the tassel bag and the ear shoot, so that as the silks emerge they will be pollinated immediately. As the wind blows, the pollen will sift down to the silks, and instead of small selfed ears one will obtain very large selfed ears. Also, another advantage is that when the tassel bag and the tube are in place, one need not visit the plant again until harvest time. © 1961 by the American Genetics Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960610680

It appears that the early evolution of the flowers of the Bennettitales is similar to the evolutionary sequence of angiosperms, and that the same type classes are represented in both plant groups. Beginning with amorphic flower types, which are represented only in the Bennettitales, the floral evolution is continued as a parallel trend in both plant groups, until the angiosperms, after the extinction of the first group, became the sole carriers of this evolutionary trend. To explain this phenomenon, a new theory of transmissibility of flower types from one plant group to another was elaborated, which proposes the mediation of pollinating insects in initiating and conducting certain parallel evolutionary trends in several plant groups.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008133972

Results and discussion are summarized as follows: About 5 to 6 days after flowering, a radial arrangement of starch tissue which mainly consisted of thin cells became clear to be seen. And the thin cells especially along the dorso-ventral diameter remained thin and sometimes opaque through the entire ripening period. The radial tissue was well-arranged in the common kernels, whereas polygonal large-cells enclosing a bundle of thin-cells were observed in the white-core kernels. The progress of translucentization of starch tissue of white-core varieties was somewhat sluggish in early stages of ripening. Generally the growth of kernel was rather rapid on its abdominal side in early ripening stage except for several days after pollination and on its dorsal side in the later stages. The ventral side of the kernel of white core variety showed the better growth, especially at the sarly stage of the kernel development, compared with that of common variety. It is considered that vigorous developent of ventral side causes more but thinner cells in that side and thinner cells in the opposite side, resulting in the formation of inavcive tissues of thin cells along the dorso-ventral diameter, and censequently the occurrence of white core in those tissues. © 1960, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

Where emasculation is difficult, the number of flowers pollinated is often not sufficient to ensure a successful cross. In addition, numerous other complications such as mechanical damage to the carpels and petioles, deleterious effects of bagging, and protection of bagged portions of the plant against the elements under field conditions, all operate against the possibility of a successful cross. The polycross technique minimizes most of these problems; however, a more serious problem often arises in using this techniquethat of distinguishing the true hybrids in segregating populations. A useful method for recognizing true hybrids from selfs among polycross progeny has been noted recently in a cross between an annual and a perennial species of the genus AIopecurus. The characteristics of these grasses were sufficiently distinct to assume that hybrid plants could be recognized in a polycross progeny. The first years growth of the polycross seed taken from the annual parent revealed no obvious hybrids. However, hybrid seed was apparently present as the second growing season revealed that the first winter had removed all of the parental annual plants, leaving only a few perennial plants. These few plants closely resembled the annual parent, with the exception of being perennial. In this particular cross hybridity was further confirmed since the parents differed in chromosome number and the hybrids carried the expected intermediate number. © 1960 by the American Genetics Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960575719

During an early period (3~5 days after flowering) the ovary retains the ability of fertilization. In natural conditions, however, there is little additional pollination on the stigma of reopen floret, and besides, the fertility of the pistil is lost since the 5~6th day. Therefore, all of the reopen florets do not produce grains. The properties of the reopen floret obtained by the present experiments are able to be utilized for early surveying the empty flower percentage caused by failure of fertilization. © 1960, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

Br. ex Mirb.) belongs to the 1-year life cycle type of podocarp. Ripe seeds are shed 12-13 months after pollination. There is a single gynospore mother cell in a well-defined tapetum, and the inner spore of a linear tetrad is functional. Pollen tubes make contact with the developing female pro- thallus before the stage of free nuclear division is complete. They continue to grow downwards between it and the nucellus. There are several superficial arche- gonia, some of which may be enveloped by a common jacket layer. They are of intermediate length, and develop along the line of contact between the pollen tube and prothallus. The gynospore layer membrane remains thin at this point. Five free mitoses of the zygote nucleus take place, the first two in the mid archegonial area. The proembryonic nuclei become tiered with a low number in the embryonic layer. The embryonic cells have the usual binucleate phase followed by tetrad formation. Simple polyembryony is common, and though fission may occur it is not general. © 1960 CSIRO.

The results of daily observations were summarised as follows : During 10~8 days before flowering (for short b. f.? in the rest), embryo sac gave rise to-8 nucleate stage through 3 times of nuclear division comprising a micropylar and central quartet (Figs. 1-5). Then of 8 nuclei, 3 at the micropylar end gave rise to the egg apparatus ; 3 at the chalazal side of the central quartet gave rise to antipodal cells ; and remaining 2, one from each quartet migrated into the micropylar vacuole without cell membrane formation, and gathered to form the polar nuclei. 2 synergid cells started protrution in their charazal sides next day (7 days b. f.), and maturated by 2 days b. f., thus they became slightly senile on flowering day. The egg cell entered into growing at 6 days b. f. and continued its growth till flowering day. 2 polar nuclei getting-closer mutually were located near the egg apparatus by 3~2 days b. f. In mature embryo sac they were in close contact with each other, however, never fused prior to fertilization. Very interesting observations were obtained in the development of antipodal cells. Immediately after the formation of 3 antipodal cells, they entered into cell division to fill up the chalazal vacuole (Figs. 7~10). These additional cell divisions proceeded 4 times and resulted in about 40 cells which occupied the chalazal half space of the embryo sac by 4~3 days b. f. (Fig. 14). After the 2 nd division, one of the antipodal cells which was located at the chalazal pole showed a singularity and divided to form a haustrium composed of some special shaped cells at 6~5 days. b. f. (Figs. 10~14). The antipodal haustrium was short-lived and degenerated after the 4th or the last division of other antipodal cells and the contiguous antipodal cells also begun to degenerate continuously. However, antipodal cells in micropylar side increased in their size accompanying; with rapid enlargement of the embryo sac that occurred from 2~1 days b. f. (Fig. 16). on the flowering day, antipodal complex was situated in somewhat lateral side of the embryo sac, and consisted of 12~17 large, mature cells (Fig. 17). The number of the antipodal cells had little-relation with the varietal and environmental differences but varied with the age of the embryo sac remarkably (Table 2). Based upon these observations, the authors think that the antipodal cells. contribute to the growing of the embryo sac during before flowering. By 2 days b. f. the embryo sac came to obtain the ability to fertilize, however, its subsequent. development was somewhat incomplete. On the day before flowering the embryo sac was able to give rise to normal seed if artificially pollinated, although its anthers were not yet mature. © 1960, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

Morus species (mulberry) and Fraxinus velutina (Arizona ash) are found to be the most important tree pollinators contaminating the air in the spring. Franseria species (false ragweeds) and Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass) are heavy pollinators that reach anthesis in the spring and shed pollen sporadically through the summer and fall. (Contrary to popular belief, only one grass-Bermuda-was found to shed great enough concentrations of pollen to be considered significantly important as a general allergen.) Amaranthus palmeri (careless weed) and Atriplex species (saltbush) are heavy contributors to the atmospheric pollen in the summer and fall months, the careless weed being the most important. Finally, the fungous spores are found in the air year round, with spores of Alternaria species the most prevalent. 4. 4.

Namely, in spite of the fertilization taking place completely, on account of the starch accumulated in the vegetative parts being incapable of translocating for fruiting, the ovares can not develop. When the pollinated ovaries are plucked in the early fruiting stage the rest of the other young pollinated ovaries begin to develop. When the ovaries are not plucked, they make it a rule to fructify according to a certain definite order, and, when they reach a certain number, the other ovaries do not grow to fructify, even if they are pollinated. If we periodically pluck the ovaries which have begun to fructify, the percentage of fruiting or that of an immature ear of wheat is not much different from that of the ovaries, which are not plucked at all. But the number of the ovaries, which have begum to develop for friting, decreases in proportion to the number of the plucked ovaries. Through the observation on the starch in the stem which was done to prove the fact stated above, it has made clear that the grains of starch grow in proportion to the growth of the vegetative parts, and have a tendency to be layers. The sum-total of stocked starch increases as the plant grows and the sum of starch in the stem never diminishes in any growth-stages. These phenomena prove that the invertion and the transformation of carbohydrates take place very slowly in buckwheat, so it is most indesirable for the crops in which only their fruited grains are aimed at harvesting for actual use. © 1960, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

The origin of the disease is unknown, but evidence suggests that it was not present in the orchards prior to 1957. The seasonal development and symptoms of the disease are described in detail. Fire?blight attacked trees only during the growing season; infection began in the blossoms, particularly summer blossoms, and spread into the branches forming cankers, in many of which the pathogen remained viable during the winter 19578. In the orchards examined there was a higher incidence of new infections by July 1958 on trees attacked the previous year than on those which were then healthy, and this is discussed in relation to overwintering sources of inoculum. The distribution of the disease in orchards during 1957 and 1958 was consistent with spread by pollinating insects rather than rain. The outstanding susceptibility of the variety Laxton's Superb in all localities was attributed partly to its tendency to produce abundant secondary blossom. Inoculations of blossoms, fruits, shoots and branches showed it also to have less inherent resistance than the varieties Williams's Bon Chrétien and Conference, neither of which has been seriously affected in the field. The progress of symptoms following inoculation of pear and infection experiments with apple, Cotoneaster sp., Pyracantha sp., and other hosts, are described. A comparison of climatic conditions favouring the disease in the U.S.A., i.e. high temperatures and high humidity, with meteorological records at East Malling, suggests that epidemic infection of spring blossom would be exceptional in this country.

An array of suitably prepared microscope slides arranged concentrically around the ragweed plot was used to determine the deposition of pollen during a ten-day period.

(2) Artificial pseudo-compatibility - caused by mechanical (e.g. washing, shaving, wounding or amputation of stigma; bud pollination), chemical (e.g. treatment with hormones) and environmental (e.g. growing plants in cold temperature conditions or selfing during the end of flowering season) treatment of plants or flowers. And (3) Genetics pseudo-compatibility - caused by the modifier genes (major or polygenic), or the mutated S alleles, or may be the result of inappropriate combination of S alleles with respect to the dominance relationship in the pollen and the style. The last is possible only in the sporophytic system and in the gametophytic system with 2 series of S alleles. It has been suggested that, in nature, pseudo-compatibility in the homomorphic sporophytic species is largely environmental whereas that in the gametophytic species it is largely genetic (mostly S allele mutations). Artificial pseudo-compatibility can be obtained in both gametophytic and sporophytic species without any relation to incompatibility systems. The nature of mutations of the S allele which cause pseudo-compatibility has been discussed in detail. The available information from different species has been critically examined in relation to: (1) conventional crossing-over; (2) unequal crossing-over; (3) sub-chromatid breakage; and (4) ""complementary"" and ""independent"" mutations. It is suggested that 4 kinds of mutations may be involved: (1) loss (deletion) mutations; (2) non-loss mutations involving crossing-over between ? and ? parts of 2 different S alleles resulting in a composite allele of which the 2 parts are not complementary in reaction e.g. S2?2?, S4?4? ? S4?2?, S2?4? (3) non loss mutations involving crossing-over which result in recombination between the male elements from 2 different S alleles producing a new pollen specificity; and (4) non-loss mutations of a constructive nature bringing about qualitative changes (genuine mutation). Generally mutations of only one of the 2 alleles present in a plant are obtained. This has been suggested to be due to the inviability of the pollen which contains that recombination product of crossing-over between the elements of S alleles which is devoid of pollen growth part. Only pollen with the reciprocal recombination product, having pollen growth part of the S allele (here occurring in double dose), are functional. It has been concluded that the large number of S alleles occurring in the multiallelic type of incompatibility system evolved de novo rather than from mutations of one allele into another.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008006998

Silow1 reviewed the early usage of this term and proposed the term 'voluntarily self-sterile' to describe Lotus plants that fail to set seed when isolated from insects and 'artificially self-sterile' when they still fail to set self-seed following artificial self-pollination. He observed that several Lotus species in isolation set more self-seed following artificial self-pollination than the same plants without artificial self-pollination. This difference can be accounted for by the presence of a stigmatic membrane which prevents germination and growth of any pollen. This membrane is ruptured by artificial self-pollination or by insect pollination of the flower, after which pollen can germinate and grow. The presence of a stigmatic membrane was observed by Elliott2 in L. tenuis and by Giles3 in L. corniculatus. Giles3 was unable to observe any difference in germination between self- and cross-pollen once the membrane ruptured. The presence of a similar membrane was observed by me4 in several other Lotus species. This membrane can account for the observed voluntary self-sterility and for differences between voluntary and artificial self-sterility, but it does not account for artificial self-sterility. © 1959 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345046590

He mentions that this result apparently seemed to contradict the somewhat accepted view that albinism is due to recessive genes as was claimed by Torres for the Szinkom mandarin. Several other workers, Patel2 in the case of the coconut, Bull3 in the case of the African oil palm, Posnette and Cropley4 in the case of the strawberry, Rick et al.5 in the case of the tomato, also believed that the cause of albinism was due to certain disturbed genetical factors brought together by cross-pollination. Some botanists have attributed the lack of chlorophyll to infection with an unknown disease. Pretreating citrus seeds with disinfectants such as 'Ceresan' and 'Agrosan' resulted in the production of seedlings which were nearly all green. Albino avocado seedlings were shown by Wallace and Drake6 to result both from seeds originating from off bloom or late set fruit as well as from matured fruits. Tager and Cameron7 on the other hand, found that albinism could be eliminated in citrus seedlings by the removal of seed-coats before sowing, indicating that the inhibitor of chlorophyll formation resided in the seed coats. Furtado2 has mentioned coconut seedlings exhibiting complete shoot albinism, attributing this to some internal factor and chlorosis due to lack of ferrugenous products in the endosperm. © 1959 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36949089713

An insufficient pollination may take place in the centre of too closely planted beds. 4. Bees do not improve fruit setting in Jucunda. 5. Usually the development of good anthers in Jucunda is not abundant, which means that the quantity of pollen produced is not large. 6. The quality of the pollen, expressed as a percentage of morphologically good pollen, of the bad clone JK3 was sometimes a little lower than that of the good clones of Jucunda. 7.

From an experience embracing more than 5,000 tests over a period of more than five years, we are convinced that eye tests with the same powdered inhalant allergens (including pollens and atmospheric molds) that are employed in scratch tests are safe, practical, and useful adjuncts to the skin testing procedure. 2. 2. With proper precautions, tests with all the important inhalants can be completed in a relatively short time, either simultaneously with or independently of skin testing, and can act as a check on the latter. 3. 3. Untoward reactions were infrequent. They can be prevented in all patients by the early removal of the instilled allergens in positive reactors and by the use of an appropriate ophthalmic decongestant. 4. 4. Complete eye tests performed in more than thirty nonsensitive control patients were entirely negative to all inhalant allergens. This proved that the test materials per se were not irritating and would not induce nonspecific positive reactions. 5. 5. Positive reactions were more frequent with those inhalant allergens having a correspondingly high incidence of positive skin test reactions. 6. 6. The clinical usefulness of eye tests was evaluated in relation to skin tests with the same allergens and to the patient's history of clinical sensitiveness. The results of this evaluation indicated that the eye test was especially helpful in the following situations: 6.1. (a) To determine the presence or absence of clinical sensitivity in patients with positive skin tests but negative or doubtful clinical history. This information proved helpful in therapeutic management, especially in patients with positive skin tests to house dust, animal dander, or pollens with overlapping pollination periods (for example, trees and grasses). 6.2. (b) As a means of uncovering unsuspected etiological factors in patients with negative skin tests and indefinite clinical histories. The occurrence of positive eye tests in such patients suggests the possible additional utilization of complete eye tests with common inhalant allergens in those patients with vague clinical histories and undetermined etiology. 6.3. (c) To affirm the nonclinical nature of positive skin tests in patients with negative clinical histories in whom the eye tests also were negative. © 1959.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250808072

The so-called open pollination of a female plant in a commercial or trial field can therefore only be carried out out by a very limited number of male plants. Comparison of the yield from selected female plants with the yield of those groups of pollinators which belong to these female plants shows that the variations in the production of spears are about equally large. From this it was concluded that the father plants have as large an effect as the mother plants on the characters of progenies of open-pollinated female plants. Therefore assessment of the genetical value of open-pollinated mother plants on the basis of a progeny test is considered to be unreliable. © 1959 H.

Dosages upto 9600 r were found to enhance the rate of growth of pollen tubers per unit time. Advantage was taken of this observation to overcome the incompatibility normally found in the cross N. tabacum x N. rustica as a result of the inadequate growth of rustica pollen tubes in tabacum style. Thus, when rustica pollen exposed to 4800 r and 9600 r of X-rays were used to pollinate tabacum, fertilization resulting in the formation of viable hybrid seeds occurred. In the cross N. rustica×N. tabacum there is partial seed failure as a result of the hyperplastic development of the nucellar and endothelial cells. However, when X-rayed tabacum pollen were used in the cross, seed development registered a marked improvement. Since there is now evidence for suggesting that the contents of even those pollen tubes which do not participate in fertilization have some role to play in the development of the seed, it seems likely that radiation-induced biochemical changes in pollen may prove advantageous when conditions for seed development are abnormal as in instances of somatoplastic sterility. Besides such indirect biochemical effects, irradiation of pollen may also lead to genetic changes resulting in the inactivation of zygotic lethals. Thus, there is much scope for investigating the use of radiation to overcome inter-specific and inter-generic cross-incompatibility barriers. © 1959 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347194353

This phenomenon was by no means new and has since been of more or less frequent occurrence. In the present paper a survey is given of the possible causes of a poor fruit set in strawberries in general; in a second article the investigations of the Jucunda variety will be dealt with. External causes of poor fruit setting are spring frost during the blooming period; damage caused to flowers by parasites, either insects, mites or fungi; unfavourable weather conditions during flowering; in growing under glass insufficient air circulation and insufficient pollination by bees due to keeping the frames closed too much; insufficient pollination in overcrowded beds; and unfavourable structure of the soil. However, these external factors can be eliminated to some extent by cultural measures. Therefore a more serious problem is presented by sterility or incomplete fruit setting, which is very complicated and determined genetically. Genetically, two types of strawberries can be distinguished: the all-female type, which is heterozygous for the sex factor, and the more or less hermaphrodite-male type, which is homozygous for that factor. In this latter group all kinds of intermediate forms are encountered between the all-male type with entirely sterile pistils and the almost entirely female type with only very few stamens. A good variety should have both well-developed stamens and entirely fertile pistils. Besides a fairly large number of varieties of which the stamens are well- or fairly well-developed and which have a high to moderate percentage of good pollen, there are A good variety should have both well-developed stamens and entirely fertile pistils. Besides a fairly large number of varieties of which the stamens are well- or fairly well-developed and which have a high to moderate percentage of good pollen, there are some varieties of which the stamens are usually much less developed and which produce only a low percentage of good pollen. Pistil-sterility is reflected on the one hand in all pistils of one or more of the later flowers of the inflorescence failing to set, owing to which the receptacle does not swell and berries are not developed. This phenomenon is regularly encountered in seedlings. On the other hand a certain number of the pistils of a flower may fail to set, resulting in malformed fruits. © 1959 Dr. H.

The effect of gibberellin on flower formation was larger at high concentrations than at low ones; spraying with gibberellin of high concentrations above 50 ppm promoted flower formation remarkably. In one-year-old seedlings, the formation of female flowers was promoted by sprays with gibberellin of high concentrations, but the number of seedlings which bore only male flowers was more at low concentrations. Generally speaking, the flower formation induced by spray with gibberellin was more promotive in old trees than in young seedling, especially the formation of female flowers seems to be increased in old trees by spray of gibberellin at low concentrations. The most effective season for foliar spraying with gibberellin to induce the flower formation seems to be from the end of June to the latter part of July. Spraying with gibberellin after the middle part of August inhibited the formation of male flowers in comparison with female ones. Spraying with potassium indoleacetate, sodium alpha-naphthaleneacetate, 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate, and maleic hydrazide did not induce flowering. The pollen grains collected from male flowers borne by spray with gibberellin were morphologically normal, and their germination showed as good percentage as that of un-treated control. Therefore, forest geneticists will definitely be able to use such pollens for artificial pollination. © 1959, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008131986

These are, ecological preferences of the various races, self-pollination and seed failure after pollinations involving races with different chromosome number. Some races are ecologically isolated, and on this basis the entire complex can be divided into three categories, Evidently there is a greater possibility of hybrids being formed among the races occupying the same habitat. However, out-crossing is prevented because of the obligate self-pollination in this complex. Only one type of hybrid (3×) arises in nature or has been obtained after crossing the various natural entities. In nature this hybrid arises through the production of protogynous flowers by the diploid, because such flowers are cross-pollinated by flies with the pollen of the tetraploid. Due to the malfunction of endosperm, all the other expected and unexpected hybrids among parents differing in chromosome number fail. This results in the production of only small, deformed and shrivelled seeds, which are ordinarily inviable. The barrier to crossability fails when homoploid races, irrespective of their genomic constitution, are crossed. The triploid hybrid does not break the isolation between its parents, because it is so sterile that it has given rise to a new race, hexaploid, which again is isolated from its progenitors.

Blue- and white- flowering varieties were planted in concrete frame located in the field of the Hokkaido National Agricultural Experiment Station. The flax flowers expected to open at next morning were castrated, and then a group was uncaged to expose insect visit, the second group was artificially pollinated next morning and the third was caged soon after the castration with ordinary fly screen. Natural crossing were estimated by number of blue flowered F1 plants in white flower variety planted alternately with dominant blue flower variety in 3 cm × 3 cm. The results are summarized as follows: 1) In uncaged plot, 34.3% and 31.7% of castrated flowers grew capsule in blue- and white-flower variety respectively. If there were no injury caused by castration, more capsule will grow. By following formula the possibility of capsule setting was estimated as 45.2% and 41.0% respectively. 2) In caged plot, 9.0% and 3.8% of castrated flowers grew capsule. The capsule setting in caged plot was very fewer than in uncaged plot. These results show pollens which fertilize the castrated flower are mainly brought by insects. 3) Daily capsule setting of castrated flower was very variable, 3.8%-77.5%. The flowers which opened under low temperature about 18°C, grew a few capsule by few insect visit. 4) Natural crossing were 27.94%, 5.38% and 1.62% at original mother plants, capsules and progeny seeds basis. Crossed capsules had 1.3croseed seeds of 4.4 grown seeds in average. In conclusion, to flax flower many foreign pollens are supplied by insects, but natural crossing are relatively low because the flower is pollinated preferentially by her own pollen. © 1959, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

(1) Many sterile flowers were found after the treatment, especially among flowers bloomed on the day of the treatment. (2) The number of pollination and germination of flowers bloomed on the day of the treatment varies widely, but, on the other hand, we recognized little difference between those of untreated flowers and flowers bloomed after the day of the treatment. (3) It was found that flowers, bloomed just before or just after the beginning of the wind treatment, were unpollinaied or if not, pollinated only a little, and it is considered that the fact was one of the causes of the occurrence of sterile flowers. Among flowers bloomed in the late half stage of the treatment, on the contrary, there were many pollinated extremely, and, although these show the low percentage of germination, it is considered not to be the direct cause of the sterility, because they have many germinated pollens. (4) As the causes of being unpollinated or polinated only a little, it is considered that blooming of flwors was hastened by the wind, nevertheless the dehiscence of anthers did not follow close to the blooming of flowers.

In addition, direct combine harvesting was compared with the tripod method. With the exception of the first year, which suggested certain advantages in seed production on light soil, the results obtained were not conclusive because of damage to the seed crop on light soil. The previous finding, that the best yield and quality of seed are secured from the first growth, were confirmed. It was shown that the aftermath could be cut in the autumn without a significant effect on the yield of seed, or persistency of the stand in subsequent years, and that the total yield of fodder was higher on heavy than on light soil. Direct combine harvesting of a seed crop after pre?harvest desiccation (4.8 lb. of D.N.O.C. in 30 gal. of water per acre), proved to be a satisfactory harvesting method when facilities for drying the seed were available. Observations on pollinating insects suggested that honey bees were mainly responsible for the amount of seed set. Copyright © 1959, Wiley Blackwell.

It is generally agreed that these pigments serve a useful purpose in attracting animal visitors, and therefore their presence has selective value; but while this may explain their production and maintenance in some angiosperms, it does not account for their original establishment in the plant kingdom. For carotenoids similar to those commonly found in flowers and fruits occur in all lower groups of plants, and anthocyanins (flavonoids) are found both in mosses1 and in ferns 2.

Viability seemed least affected when the pollens were dried at 90° F. for 2 1/2, 3, 4, or 6 hours. Pollens cultured on agar media separately containing fourteen concentrations of sucrose responded best to 14-16 per cent sucrose. One and 2 per cent concentrations of each of four commercial agars in the culture medium showed that there were no significant differences in germination on the two percentages, but germination on U.S.P. No. 1 shredded agar was highest. Germination of pollens cultured separately at seven temperatures (from 40° to 100° F.) was highest at 60° F., whereas the humidity was almost at the saturation point. U.S.P. No. 1 agar was adjusted to seven different pH levels. The germination was highest, among those levels, at pH 5.2. Germination percentages of potato pollens can, therefore, be expected to give an indication that a pollen is living; but the erratic reaction of potato pollen to artificial media make these percentages necessarily not reliable in regard to the actual potency of a pollen at any one time, particularly in view of that potency in pollination. © 1958 Springer.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951500248

During an investigation into the cause of this phenomenon, a number of floral-biological data have been collected which are valuable both for the seed production and breeding of this crop. 1. The distribution of male flowers and bisexual flowers. Both in the wild carrot and in 2 cultivated varieties the tendency to produce male flowers was encountered. In all forms tested the percentage of male flowers was practically negligible in the main umbel and was found to increase regularly in umbels of higher order. There were, however, clear differences in the mean percentage between the forms tested. Presumably the tendency to produce male flowers is determined genetically, but it may also be affected by the environment. 2. The occurrence of male sterility. This character, which was encountered in the wild carrot and in one cultivated variety, manifested itself in all plants tested by the fact that the filaments remained unrolled and the anthers did not dehisce. This character may prove highly valuable in the production of hybrid varieties. 3. Reduced seed set not due to bugs. In the field bugs often cause a reduction in the seed yield. From experiments made in bug-free rooms it was shown that a sufficient cross-pollination may ensure a high production of carrot seed. But even in this case an optimal seed set was not obtained. © 1958 H. Veenman en Zonen.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3543004261

High temperature, measured in degree-hours above 70°F., for a period from 48 hours before the flower opened until 72 hours after it had opened, caused a greater reduction in fruit set than did high temperature on any one day.

But the ovary at its young stage involves several ovules, ranging 2-4. In this experiment, some embryological observations were carried out, using two-ovuled ovaries, to know the causes concerned about formation of one-seeded pod. The results obtained are summarised as follows: 1) When classified by the ovule number in ovary, 81.5 % of 363 ovaries examined were two-ovuled ovaries as shown in Fig. 1. 2) When the ovaries are classified by numbers of fertilized ovules involved, 17.4% of them contained only one fertilized ovule as shown in Fig. 2. Out of them, 8.7 % contained one normal but non-fertilized ovule, the remained 8.7 % contained one abnormal ovule in which the embryo-sac was not normally formed. Those ovaries should grow into one-seeded pods. 3) Meanwhile, 77.3 % were the ovaries containing two fertilized ovules. In this case, however, the two fertilized ovules never develop evenly, but one of them was arrested in its growth and degenerated without exception. The degeneration of fertilized ovule began from about 4th day after pollination, and one-seeded pods were confirmed on about 7 th day. 4) As to the position of normal seeds in the pods, so far as this experiment is concerned, the seed-setting was found more highly at the apical (stylar) position of the ovary than at the basal as shown in Fig. 3. 5) As to the one-seeded pod formation in 3- and 4-ovuled ovaries, the main cause was the degeneration of fertilized ovules as in the case of two-ovuled ovaries. © 1958, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

After multiplication some genotypes will come to the fore, others will decrease in number or even disappear. Adaptation of iso-homozygotes (pure lines of self-fertilizing plants) or of clones (e.g. potato varieties) is based on the ability of the phenotype to be modified, therefore on the physiological response of the genotype on the milieu. Apart from sporadically occurring mutants, spontaneous cross pollination with other genotypes or admixtures (with other genotypes), the environment does not affect the genotype of iso-homozygotes or clones. This adaptation, as a consequence of the ability of modification of course also holds for populations of cultivated plants. The same principle is valid for parasites and micro-organisms. The breeder therefore should strive after the creation of genotypes that prevent the adaptation of parasites. In the case of leguminous crops, however, he should attempt to develop genotypes that profit from symbiosis with useful root bacteria. In all breeding procedures the adaptability of the selections will be of the utmost importance. The breeder will try to get a clear perception of the adaptability of his selections and on these grounds he will choose his selections for inclusion in trials set op for cultural value. © 1957 H.

Two systems of selection which provide such data have been introduced at the Cambridge Plant Breeding Institute. In one, known as the F2 progeny method of selection, the progenies of selected F2 plants are grown in yield trials without further selection during F4, F5 and F6 after which single plant selections are made within the more promising progenies. In the other system, known as the pedigree trial method of selection, normal pedigree selection is carried out in F2 and F3. In the F4 generation single plants are selected from the better families for continued pedigree selection and within each of these families the remaining plants are bulked to give grain for a yield trial in the following year. This process is repeated in F5 and F6, the grain for trial being in each case obtained from the progeny rows and not from the preceding trial. The use of these methods is illustrated by reference to wheat hybrids grown at Cambridge, and the data obtained is shown to be useful in comparing the value of different parental combinations as well as in assessing the relative merits of the selections within each cross. © 1957 H.

It is also capable of yielding a fair crop of about 80 fruits annually (unaided by hand-pollination) which can considerably be raised by making cross-pollination possible between it and A. squamosa. This can be arranged by growing a few plants of A. squamosa along with the plants of hybrid No. 2 in the same plantation. The poor setting of fruits generally observed in all hybrids confirm the observations of P. J. Wester that the flowers of atemoyas require to be cross-pollinated for setting a successful crop. According to Wester's investigations carried out in Florida, U.S.A., the flowers of annonas are protogynous and entomophilous, i.e., the pistils of the flowers are receptive before the anthers have developed ripe pollen, cross-pollination being therefore necessary and some outside agency like insects being required to effect it. To overcome this problem of cross-pollination, adequate provision for keeping a sufficient number of bee-hives should be made for the mixed plantations of Atemoyas and A. squamosa, that may be planted in future. As the progeny raised from seed would not breed true to type, No. 2 hybrid should be further propagated either by layering or by inarch-grafting on the root-stocks of A. squamosa or A. cherimolia. © 1957 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951503163

Its retardation begins at germination, and heading delays for about two weeks as compared with normal Emmer wheats. The degree of retardation is more striking in the group sown at unusual seasons than in those at the normal conditions, and varies with the different strains used as pollinators. On the other hand, ovata plants with durum cytoplasm have also shown a delayed heading over one week, in spite of having a normal pollen production. 2) Male-sterile Emmer plants possess a considerably lower culm than normal plants. The difference in plant height between normal and male-sterile plants is distinguishable clearly and varies with the time of sowing, showing a greater difference in the later sowing than in the earlier sowing. 3) A conspicuous chlorophyll variegation of whitish dots and stripes appears in male-sterile durum strains. Its appearance varies with the growing stages, showing a maximum symptom during the winter season. In some Emmer strains with ovata cytoplasm, no variegated leaves were observed. Reciprocally substituted plants consisting of ovata genomes and durum cytoplasm do not show any chlorophyll veriega-tion, having normal pollen production. © 1957, The Genetics Society of Japan.

The number of bivalents, for ToriSaF1 up to 3 and for TSpeSmF1 up to 7, may be chiefly due to the autosyndesis of chromosomes of AB (ToriSaF1) or ABD (TSpeSmF1) genomes. In these bivalents of TSpeSmF1, however, bivalents produced by conjugation of the chromosomes of S. montanum may have been involved. 7. In these F1, the formation of equatorial plate in heterotypic metaphase of PMC's was observed in some individuals, in addition to the normal Frtype division commonly observed in the wheat-rye F1 hybrids.

Nuts from three different trees have been analysed and differences between these in rates of maturation (as indicated by appearance of the endosperm) can be directly correlated with changes in character of the oil present.Amounts of reducing sugars, sucrose, and starch in the developing endosperm have also been followed, but these carbohydrates are present throughout in low concentration, and it is assumed that translocation from the rest of the plant to the developing kernel must account for the major part of storage material.The mature kernel contains in its fat an unusual mixture of eight different saturated fatty acids. The major such component is lauric acid (46·1 to 49·5 per cent.) and there are present two common unsaturated acids, oleic (15·7 to 16·5 per cent.) and linoleic acid (0·7 to 3·1 per cent.). At the earliest stage examined (10 weeks after pollination) all these acids are.present but in altered proportions, unsaturated acids forming a larger fraction (36·5 to 81·2 per cent., according to the tree investigated), and lauric acid (1·4 to 8·5 per cent.) a smaller.The results suggest that young kernels contain a small quantity of a largely unsaturated 'protoplasmic' fat, and that at a certain stage in development some physiological change in the tissue results in the formation, in large quantities, of a new, highly saturated storage fat. No fatty acid interconversions could be demonstrated although there is some suggestion that oleic acid behaves anomalously.There is evidence that free fatty acids are not accumulated prior to esterification. © 1956 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006788490

A study of transverse sections of stems revealed considerable difference between the fiber bundles of diploid and tetraploid strains the latter being commercially inferior to diploid. There was a conspicuous difference in the reciprocal crosses of tetraploids presumably due to the incompatible genetical constitution of the female parent. Crosses between 2n and 4n plants showed that they were highly incompatible - an economic character of great significance for it ensures the purity of the tetraploid strains. Cytological studies showed that about 47 per cent of the tetraploid plants were aneuploids. Meiotic studies revealed various irregularities at different stages of first and second divisions. Of the aneuploids, only 58-chromosome plants produced a few seeds. The following factors seemed to be jointly responsible for sterility in tetraploid linseed: - (1) Meiotic abnormalities in pollen mother cells were common. (2) The majority of embryo-sacs (70 per cent) failed to attain a fully mature, 8-nucleate stage at the time of fertilization. (3) In some tetraploid plants (about 10 per cent) there was considerable sterility presumably as a result of the defective mode of anther dehiscence which made self-pollination difficult. (4) Of the apparently fertile pollen grains 13.8 per cent failed to germinate. (5) Of the total number of pollen tubes only 11.1 per cent were of the normal type (diploid - 25 per cent), compared with 88.9 per cent of abnormal types of pollen tubes, many of which burst or aborted during their way down the style. Thus only 8-9 per cent of the pollen grains on the stigma were fully capable of effecting fertilization. The failure of some pollen grains to germinate and considerable abnormality in pollen tube growth indicated that partial self-incompatibility may have been in operation. A hypothesis explaining the occurrance of such partial self-incompatibility in autotetraploids was proposed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33947467038

Pods were observed to be specially liable to wilt at two stages in their development. These periods were called 'first wilt' and 'second wilt' respectively.First wilt reaches its peak at 7 weeks after pollination and is shown to cease as cell walls are laid down in the endosperm. Second wilt reaches its peak at 10 weeks from pollination and declines in response to greatly increased pod metabolism. Pods which wilt during second wilt have larger embryos and smaller pod stalks than comparable healthy pods.It is postulated that both types of wilt arise as a result of a lack of hormones produced by the endosperm, causing a decrease in the uptake of water and food materials and thereby bringing on wilt.This theory is discussed with reference to previous work and to the possible use of growth substances as a control measure. © 1956 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17744362417

Research showed that in swollen seedlings the eelworms had multiplied (susceptible plants) whereas this is not the case in non-swollen plants with a stunted growth and brown stripes (resistant plants). The increase of eelworms in greatly swollen plants of Roosendaal red clover took place at a greater speed than in slightly swollen plants. In healthy-looking plants mostly no or few eelworms had invaded. It seems that these plants have escaped a degree of infection necessary to judge their resistance. It appeared that varieties of red clover which are susceptible or resistant to stem eelworms of a given origin from the Netherlands were susceptible or resistant in about the same degree to eelworms derived from a quite different part of this country. A good conformity between laboratory and field resistance was found. If in spring bumble-bee boxes are hung in trees according to the method described, in about 10 to 20% of the boxes a good bumble-bee nest is found in the beginning of July. These populations are suitable to use for the crossing of clover plants in cages. Inside the cages seed production per plant was generally much lower than outside. By intercrossing resistant plants of Dutch local varieties and selection in the progenies, fairly resistant families were obtained within some years. © 1956 H.

Bulbosan (trichlorotrinitrobenzene) is an effective chemical means of control. Between 1945 and 1954 this German fungicide could not be supplied, and, as a result, the need for resistant varieties became very great. Before 1920 scab-resistance in pickling cucumbers was already known to Dutch growers. Selection started around 1920 on the initiative of W. G. v. d. Kroft and resulted in scab-resistant pickling cucumbers of which Baarlose Nietplekker VI is still widely grown. In 1948 G. W. v. d. Helm (Exp. Garden at Sloten) started breeding a scab-resistant yellow slicing cucumber destined for gardeners in the neigh-bourhood of Amsterdam. The resistant variety Highmoor was used as one parent. In 1954 the yellow variety Vios and the white variety Mabro were introduced. In 1952 G. W. v. d. Helm at the Exp. Garden Sloten, and J. M. Andeweg at the Institute of Horticultural Plant Breeding, Wageningen, simultaneously started breeding green scab-resistant frame cucumbers, using Highmoor as the resistant parent. In 1955 the experimental garden at Sloten introduced the scab-resistant green slicing cucumbers Amato and Proso, while in 1956 the Institute of Horticultural Plant Breeding introduced the scab-resistant green slicing cucumber Esvier. In 1953 seed of 2 first-backcross populations was supplied by the Institute to seed growers. At present intensive breeding for scab-resistance is also being carried out by a number of Dutch seed growers. Scab-resistance depends on one dominant gene; and young plants can readily be tested for resistance. Consequently a backcross scheme can easily be carried out. Rapid breeding is possible because at least 2 cultures can be carried out yearly. If necessary, cuttings of promising plants can be taken. Before and after artificial pollination the flowers can be tied up with raffia. It is simpler, however, to pinch the flowers with a special stainless clip as originally used for grafting cucumbers. The uniform fruit colour of the Dutch green frame slicing cucumbers is a recessive character; the fruit length of the Dutch varieties is dominant. © 1956 H.

In the present report; the suitable seed harvesting times were studied with 13 gramineae grasses, and researches were made with orchard grass on tillering which has close relations with seed yield. (I) The average period from heading to harvesting stage of typical 13 grasses imported to Japan, were roughly classified into 3 grades as follows ; 1) less than 30 days ; 2) about 40 days ; 3) about 50 days or more. (II) There are found three peaks in the whole years curve of tillering of orchard grass, namely those in March, June, and Octover. In the first year, the largest part of the seed yield of orchard grass are obtained from the tillers of 1st, 2nd and 3rd orders, and the highest yield was from those of 2nd order. In the 2nd year, the major part of the yield was from the tillers of 4th, 5th and 6th orders, the 5th giving the highest yield. As to the fruitful tiller percentage, that of fall-midwinter tillers was relatively high, while it fell acutely in early spring tillers. Many of the main stems of orchard grass stopped growing in the midway. Even in those which headed and ripened, the seed yield was very small. From the comparison of the length of the tillering periods in the first year with that in the 2nd year, the latter was greatly found remarkably shorter making seed production technically more efficient. © 1956, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

The differences in the length of styles has nothing to do in the failure of crossing rotundifolia female (2n=40) with vinifera male (2n=38), since the pollen tubes of vinifera penetrate the entire style and in some cases the ovules of rotundifolia pistils in the duration of time as control. The absence of swelling of the ovaries even four days after cross-pollination with vinifera and secondly the abscisson of pollinated as well as non-pollinated pistils at about the same time suggests that fertilization does not occur. The complete failure of crossing, therefore, must reside in the cytoplasm of either embryo-sac or/and maternal tissue surrounding the embryo-sac. © 1956, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

But the ovary involves two ovules at its young stage. Experiments were undertaken to know of the causes concerned in formation of one-seeded pods from two-ovuled ovaries. Using plants of the variety Mammoth as materials, all their flowers were artificially cross-pollinated and examined through the paraffin method. The results obtained from three years' studies were as follows : I. At the time of flowering, (1) 30&sim;50 % of ovaries contained one normal and one abnormal ovules each, in the latter the embryo-sac being not normally formed ; (2) 6&sim;10 % contained two abnormal ovules in each ; and (3) the rest 40&sim;60 % contained two normal ovules. The ovaries of the case (1) should develop into one-seeded pods provided that the normal one of the ovules are fertilized. II. Even if the ovaries involve two normal ovules, as in the case (3), they might produce one-seeded pods when one of the two is not fertilized. By observation made at 48 hours after pollination, it was confirmed that (4) 20.8 % of them corresponded to above-mentioned case of one seeded pod formation. (5) The remaining 18.3 % were the ovaries consisting of two ovules both of which were non-fertilized ; while (6) 60.8 % were the ovaries containing two fertilized ovules. III. In the case (6), however, when observed on the tenth day after pollination, the two fertilized ovules never developed evenly, but one of them was arrested in its growth and degenerated without exception, so far as this experiment was concerned, and thus the ovaries grew into one-seeded pods. The degeneration was found to begin within five days after pollination. © 1956, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024277959

In this experiment, some embryological observations were carried out, using four-ovuled ovaries, on the process of above-mentioned one seed formation and abortion, and the results obtained were summarized as follows : (1) The abortion of ovules is partially due to fertilization failure. Namely, 27.0 % of ovules observed were not fertilized. Out of them ; 22.0 % were abnormal ovules in which the embryo-sac was not normally formed, and the remained 5.0 % were normal but non-fertilized ovules. Therefore, the main cause for non-fertilization is owing to embryo-sac failure. (2) When the ovaries are classified by numbers of fertilized ovules involved, 12.0 % of them contained only one fertilized ovule and these ovaries should grow into one-seeded pods. The remained 88.0 % were the ovaries consisting of more than two fertilized ovules, especially, 38.0 % were the ovaries in which all ovules were fertilized. Nevertheless, when observed on the 10th day after pollination, 97.4 % were the ovaries in which more than two fertilized ovules never developed evenly and all but one were arrested their growth, and consequently they grew into one-seeded pods. (3) The degeneration of fertilized ovules began from about 5th day after pollination, and one-seeded pods were confirmed on about 7th day. (4) As to the position of normal seeds in the pods, there was a marked tendency that the seed-setting increased from the stylar (apical) end toward the basal end of the ovary. So far as this experiment is concerned, 85.7 % were the pods in which either basal or subsequent ovule developed into normal seed. © 1956, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

They were present in only a few instances on the flowering heads of hay plants (wind pollinated) but on almost all the flowers of garden plants (insect pollinated). Although cereal crops are wind pollinated, coli?aerogenes organisms were found on about one?third of the grains examined. The question of their origin on grain is discussed. In a series of paired samples of soil and of the foliage of the covering vegetation, coli?aerogenes organisms were present in most of the soil samples, but were absent from the foliage except where animal contamination was possible, as in the case of grazed pasture. With foliage samples unlikely to have been contaminated by animals, most of the coli?aerogenes organisms isolated were A. cloacae, but with grazed pasture E. coli predominated, indicating contamination by grazing animals. The coli?aerogenes floras of garden flowers and cereal grains corresponded closely, consisting in each case largely of A. cloacae. Copyright © 1956, Wiley Blackwell.

Average hybridization was 17%, ranging from 5 to 32% in different flower samples. End plants were 25% outcrossed and those within the row were 15%, the difference being partly due to intra-pollination within the row. Terminal flowers were 19% outcrossed but lateral flowers only 16%; flowers on south-facing inflorescences had 20% and those facing north 15%. These differences were statistically significant. 3. Average first-year germination was 45%, with a range from 18 to 66% in different fruit samples. End plants had 50% germination and plants within the row had 44%; terminal fruits had 42% and laterals 49%. These differences were statistically significant. South and north facing fruits had similar germinations. 4.

Completely negative results were obtained in limited attempts to intercross Lolium perenne with Arrhenatherum avenaceum, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Bromus eretus and Dactylis glomerata. 2. The results of intercrossing L. perenne with Bromus asper and with Lepturus cylindricus must also be regarded as negative. 3. One seedling was obtained by intercrossing L. perenne and Glyceria fluitans, but this plant produced no inflorescences and its constitution is not known. 4. Established Fb1 hybrid plants were obtained when L. perenne was pollinated by Fesluca gigantea, but seeds from the reciprocal cross failed to germinate. 5. The anthers of the L. perenne-F. gigantea Fp1 hybrids were non-dehiscent, and in limited tests the ovaries did not respond to pollination by either parent species. 6. Additional crosses between L. perenne and F. arundinacea confirmed results previously reported. With F. arundinacea as the pistillate parent the seeds produced failed to germinate. 7. The anthers of the L. perenne-F. arundinacea Fp1 hybrids were non-dehiscent, but one plant gave established progeny when pollinated by either F. arundinacea or by L. perenne. 8. The single backcross plant obtained by the pollination of the Fp1 hybrid by F. arundinacea was highly sterile and gave no progeny. 9. The backcross plants obtained by pollinating the L. perenne-F. arundinacea Fp1 hybrid with L. perenne pollen were highly sterile, but one of them, the 22-chromosome plant 23-bE-7/1, gave established progeny when pollinated by either F. arundinacea or by L. perenne. 10. The single plant obtained by the pollination of plant 23-bE-7/1 with F. arundinacea gave no progeny. 11. Plant 23-bE-7/l was also successfully intercrossed with an artificially produced but unrelated triploid hybrid derivative, plant 56-bE-2. 12. Plants 23-bE-7/1 and 56-bE-2 and their common derivatives have been discussed elsewhere in another connexion (Jenkin, 1955f). 13. Some of the derivatives of plant 23-bE-7/1 backcrossed to L. perenne were used for further breeding, and both the cytological and pollen-fertility data given by Peto (1933) have been used in discussing the results. 14. The plants of the third generation (second backcross to L. perenne) varied considerably both in type and in vigour, although in no case was the influence of F. arundinacea ancestry strongly evident. Some were morphologically indistinguishable from L. perenne. 15. Some of the least 'normal' (on L. perenne standards) were not studied by Peto and therefore his results, 2 n=14 to 2 n=18, do not necessarily represent the group as a whole. 16. Plants of the third generation with 14, 17 and 18 chromosomes respectively were successfully intercrossed with F. arundinacea; plants with 15, 17 and 18 chromosomes were also successfully intercrossed with L. perenne, while 14- and 15-chromosome plants when intercrossed gave established progeny. 17. Plants of the fourth generation (third backcross to L. perenne) were, with a few exceptions, indistinguishable morphologically from L. perenne. The plants of this generation examined by Peto were of three chromosome types, 2 n=16 (one plant, derived from an 18-chromosome parent); 2 n=15 (six plants) and 2 n=14 (seventeen plants). 18. With repeated backcrossing to L. perenne there was a progressive return towards this species in both morphology and chromosome numbers. 19. There was also a return towards full fertility, but there were exceptional cases where chromosome numbers and fertility did not correspond. 20. It is concluded that natural intercrossing of L. perenne and F. arundinacea may cause a temporary disturbance of a plant population but that it has no appreciable permanent effect unless exceptional circumstances arise. © 1955 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0642359014

Negative results have been recorded for the following crosses: Bromus asper ? x Brachypodium sylvaticum ?, Brachypodium sylvaticum ? x Bromus asper ?, Avena pratensis ? x Bromus erectus ?, Bromus erectus ? x Festuca arundinacea ?, Lolium loliaceum ? x Lepturus cylindricus ?. 2. The tests for all these crosses were limited so that the negative results can only show that the species pairs concerned are not readily interfertile. 3. No fully established Fb1 hybrids were obtained when L. temulentum was pollinated by a L. rigidum s.a. plant (which would be classifiable as L. multiflorum Lam.), but a single mature plant was produced when the cross was made in the opposite direction. 4. These results are in line with those obtained when L. temulentum and L. rigidum Gaud. were intercrossed, but differ from those given by L. temulentum intercrossed with L. italicum or L. perenne. 5. The Fb1 hybrid from the cross L. rigidum s.a.? x L. temulentum ?, plant 666-bE-1, was effectively pollen-sterile but gave established progeny when used as the pistillate parent in backcrosses to either parental type. 6. From the backcross to the L. rigidum s.a. parental line, four plants were obtained, all of which could be used as either pistillate or pollen parents, although at least one of them still showed evidence of hybridity. 7. Another of the four backcross plants behaved as a normal L. rigidum s.a. plant of the parental line and had inherited the 'brittle-stem' character carried by this line as a simple monohybrid recessive. 8. The results obtained by intercrossing L. italicum with F. pratensis were in line with those previously reported for L. perenne with F. pratensis, but in the present case no fully mature Fb1 hybrid plants were obtained. 9. Germinable seeds but no established plants resulted from the pollination of L. rigidum s.a. by F. pratensis. 10. Caryopses were produced when F. pratensis and L. temulentum were intercrossed in either direction, and one seed made an abortive attempt to germinate. 11. Caryopses were also produced when F. pratensis was pollinated by L. loliaceum but none of these seeds germinated. 12. When L. loliaceum was pollinated by F. pratensis, seed-setting, seed germination and Fb1 hybrid plant establishment were all relatively high as compared with other crosses in which Lolium species were pollinated by F. pratensis. 13. Considering the extreme morphological and other differences between L. loliaceum (a diploid) and F. arundinacea (a hexaploid) the positive results obtained in seed-setting, seed germination and Fb1 hybrid plant establishment when L. loliaceum was used as the pistillate parent were remarkable. 14. In the discussion it is concluded that while it may be assumed that a degree of intercompatibility between two species sufficient to produce definite caryopses is indicative of phylogenetic relationship, the measure of this relationship is not directly represented by the relative ease with which established Fp1 hybrids can be produced. © 1955 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0642359006

It is now shown that F. gigantea can be similarly intercrossed with F. pratensis (2 n = 14) to give established F1 hybrids irrespective of the direction in which the cross is made. 5. The fertility of the F. gigantea- F. pratensis F1 hybrids is very low, but as pistillate parents they have produced second-generation plants by backcrossing to either parent species. 6. Established third-generation plants were obtained by further backcrossing the (F. gigantea- F. pratensis) ×F. gigantea second-generation plants to either F. gigantea or F. pratensis. 7. The second-generation plants (F. gigantea- F. pratensis) ×F. pratensis failed to give third-generation plants when backcrossed to either original parental species, but caryopses were produced when F. pratensis was the pollinator. 8. Evidently, normal fertility is not easily regained by backcrossing to the parental species so that intercrossing between F. gigantea and F. pratensis in nature would be expected to have little permanent effect upon a natural population. © 1955 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0642297697

Several new discoveries and observations about pollinating insects revealed to some extent the mystery of the evolution of flower types. The deciphering of the definite signs and codes of communication among social insects and the interpretation of a well developed sign language of bees belong to the most remarkable achievements of modern biology indeed. Besides its revolutionary impulse in the field of animal behavior these discoveries helped to solve several problems in the evolution of flowering plants. An attempt is made in this article to classify the existing main flower types according to their evolutionary tendency from primitive ? simple ? radiate ? protected ? zygomorphic flowers (Fig. 2) In this assortment of flower types is reflected the historical development of flowering plants since their early beginning in Cretaceous period till their domination in the recent world vegetation (Fig 3). In this evolution of flower types is mirrored further the progressive evolvement of numerous senses of the pollinating insects. The pollinators of the Middle Mesozoicum were surrounded by primitive flower types and could distinguish but some primitive colors like white, yellow and green. Two different methods of classification of flowering plants are used in this study. A typological assortment of flowers according to their ecological characteristics (Fig. 2-3) is co-ordinated with the taxonomic classification of phylogenetic groups (Fig. 4-5). The evolution of angiosperms can be studied more successfully, if both the typological and taxonomic trends of this groups are analyzed. © 1956 E. J. Brill.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342656328

The importance of male sterility as a means of breeding heterosis varieties is indicated and the advantages attached to the use of MS, and the problems arising from it, are discussed. It is contented that the rarely occuring types of plasmatically inherited MS offer good possibilities of utilization in the case of cross fertilized plants. The procedure to be adopted in using this type of MS is described in considerable detail in § 5 and 8. It is regretable that, in self-fertilized field crops under conditions of natural pollination, the small seed set obtained presents serious difficulties in breeding hybrids on a scale which is commercially justified. In horticulture, however, where artificial pollination can be made to pay, hybrids have already been created with the aid of MS types possessing a monofactorial recessive system of inheritance and have been put on the market. The procedure adopted is described in § 9. A survey is given of the results already obtained with MS in tomato, onion, sugar beet and maize, and it is anticipated that important increases in yield may also be obtained in other cross fertilized plants and self-fertilized horticultural crops with the aid of MS. © 1954 H.

S. Department of Agriculture in 1909 and is continuing. In the period 1925-49 more than 6,000 hybrids were grown. About 40 percent of the total possible number of combinations of crosses between the L3 soecies of Casta have been made successfully, indicating the close relationship existing between the species.The period of receptivity of chestnut stigmas was determined as beginning a few days after the staminate catkins began to blossom, reaching its highest degree about 12 days later, and extending nearly three weeks. Pollinations made in the morning were more effective than those made in the afternoon. Attempts to obtain viable seed by self-pollinating pistillate flowers whose styles were clipped off failed; however, viable seed was obtained by cross- pollination. Tests designed to prevent insects from visiting flowering twigs on which all staminate flowers had been emasculated showed that chestnut is wind-pollinated. Exposed pollen on anthers is at first tacky, but air currents soon dry the pollen and, together with the movements of insects feeding on the pollen and nectar of the catkins, it is dislodged and is airborne.Inheritance of blight resistance probably is controlled by two pairs of genes. Early flower ing is dominant over late flowering. At Glenn Dale, MD, temperature departures from the mean for April, and occasionally for April and May, determine when flowering begins. Time of nut drop in chestnut is inherited without dominance. Time of flowering determines the time of nut drop. Size of nuts is inherited with incomplete dominance, tending to approach the nut size of the parent producing the smaller nuts. The everbearing character found in C. seguioii is inherited iii at least a 3 : 1 ratio in the second generation.First-generation hybrids from crossing a selection of C. mollissima with C. dentata appear promising for planting as forest-timber trees. On a poor site they have grown at the rate of 2.8 feet per year for 10 years. Their blight resistance is sufficient to warrant test ing them on forest sites.Scions of Japanese chestnut carrying the mutation ""spineless"" were grafted and later crossed with other Castauca species. The mutation ""cracked-bark,"" wherein the bark of chestnut trees begins to crack at the age of three or four years, was obtained in first- generation hybrids from a C. mollissimaC. dcntata cross. Stunted growth, a general drooping of the branches, and an increased susceptibility to blight and to winter injury are associated with cracked bark. An anomaly, ""naked chestnut,"" was observed in certain hy brids: the burrs stop developing at an early stage while the nuts continue normal develop ment, so that the green nuts are exposed. The anomaly occurs in certain years and probably is a nonheritable mutation.Chestnuts, chinkapins and hybrids graft readily, but are difficult to bud. Extensive investigations have failed to develop an efficient method of rooting cuttings. © 1954 AMERICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957211404

The results previously reported for crosses between Lolium italicum and L. perenne are summarized and some new data are added. These two species can interbreed freely to produce fertile progeny. 2. The results previously reported for crosses between L. italicum and wind-pollinating annual types are also summarized. 3. No effective barrier against free interbreeding was found in the above crosses, although the seed-germination results for crosses between L. italicum and L. rigidum Gaud. are lower than in intraspecific crosses. 4. The results for crosses between L. italicum and the three self-pollinating annual species L. loliaceum, L. remotum and L. temulentum are parallel with one another in type but different in detail. 5. In all three cases when L. italicum was used as the pollen parent, stimulation of the ovaries occurred, the caryopses being well developed in length, but with the exception of one doubtful case in the cross with L. loliaceum none of the seeds germinated. 6. When L. italicum was employed as the pistillate parent, seed-setting varied from an average of 25 % with L. temulentum to 60% with L. loliaceum. 7. In none of the crosses were the caryopses up to normal length for L. italicum, and with L. remotum they were particularly small. 8. Seed germination was exceptionally high with L. loliaceum as the pollen parent surprisingly high considering the poor caryopses with L. remotum as the pollen parent and moderately high with L. temulentum as the pollen parent. 9. The results of intercrossing L. italicum with the three self-pollinating annual species therefore differ strikingly according to the direction in which the crosses are made. 10. They also differ from those obtained when L. italicum is intercrossed with other wind-pollinating species and types. 11. The results for further breeding show that the F1 plants from crosses with the self-pollinating Lolium species were highly sterile. 12. A comparison of the results obtained by using L. rigidum and L. italicum with the self-pollinating annual Lolium species strongly supports the suggestion that although L. rigidum and L. italicum intercross readily, they are yet constitutionally different from one another.

The three have been found to be inter-fertile to the extent that the three possible hybrid types have been obtained as established plants. L. loliaceum stands clearly apart from the other two species in some of its breeding reactions. With either L. remotum or L. temulentum it gave reasonably good seed-setting and high seed germination, but the seedlings developed very abnormally apparently because of lack of co-ordination between the different plant parts. Apart from all other considerations, the fact that this was common to the hybrids with both L. remotum and L. temulentum brings these two species into a special class. In addition, these two species are easily intercrossed and the F1 hybrids develop normally up to pollen formation. It is suggested that failure at pollen formation is caused by gene combinations. This possibility is not entirely removed by the results obtained by using for breeding an odd line ('L. canadense') which could not definitely be placed in either L. remotum or L. temulentum. A barrier to normal full fertility undoubtedly exists between the two types, but divergence has not yet proceeded very far. The interaction of the three species with the normally wind-pollinated Lolium types is also reviewed. I wish to express my gratitude to Mr A. R.

The present account is concerned with the breeding interactions of annual, normally wind-pollinated types of Lolium. 2. The plants used were derived from widely separated geographical areas, and the seed samples which they represented were variously named by the senders. 3. On morphological characteristics the lots represented in the breeding work now described were eventually separated into two main groups: (1) Lots which could be classified as representing L. rigidum Gaud. (2) Lots which could not easily be referred to this species owing to morphological divergences but which still varied considerably one lot from another. 4. Some exceptional results were recorded, but these do not seem to be significant in relation to the intercompatibility of the Lolium types and groups involved. 5. The breeding interactions of plants within group (2) above (referred to in the paper as L. rigidum sens, ampl.) despite their morphological differences gave results consistent with those to be expected in intraspecific breeding. 6. Similar results were obtained by interbreeding plants of diverse sources of origin but classifiable as L. rigidum Gaud. 7. Finally, when plants of the two main divisions were intercrossed the results were again consistent with those obtainable in intraspecific breeding. 8. It is therefore concluded that despite geographical separation and morphological divergences there is no evidence of species differentiation as judged on the basis of inter-fertility in the normally wind-pollinated annual Lolium types. 9.

Lolium perenne has been successfully intercrossed with all the other Lolium types, L. rigidum sens. ampl., L. italicum, L. loliaceum, L. remotum and L. temulentum, to produce established F1 hybrid progeny. 2. The results show a sharp cleavage in the genus Lolium. 3. The wind-pollinating types, whether annual or non-annual, effectively interbreed quite freely, although apparently some slight difficulty arises at seed development and seed germination when either L. italicum or L. perenne is intercrossed with L. rigidum Gaud. 4. If, in nature, L. perenne intercrossed with any of the other wind-pollinating types, a mixed hybrid population could be created and maintained until the effect of habitat environment again caused a regrouping into ecotypes. 5. The results obtained by intercrossing L. perenne with each of the three self-pollinating annual Lolium species run approximately parallel but with some apparently significant differences. In all cases the F1 hybrids are highly but not completely female sterile. 6. A particularly interesting result was the production of triple-hybrid established plants by outcrossing the L. perenne-L. loliaceum F1 hybrid to the hexaploid Festuca arundinacea. 7. Backcross hybrids derived from the self-pollinating Lolium species showed little sign of having regained fertility, so that even if, by rare chance, L. perenne did intercross with any one of these three species under natural conditions, there would be little chance of maintaining a mixed population of hybrid derivatives.

The paper is concerned with results obtained when wind-pollinating annual Lolium types Were intercrossed with other Lolium species:L. italicum, L. perenne, L. loliaceum, L. remotum and L. temulentum. 2. Of these five other species, the first two are wind-pollinating and non-annual and the other three self-pollinating and annual. 3. The wind-pollinating annual types are considered in two groups: (a) Those classifiable as L. rigidum Gaud. (b) Those not classifiable as L. rigidum Gaud. 4. This distinction is not emphasized except in crosses with L. italicum and L. perenne. 5. The results obtained by intercrossing either L. italicum or L. perenne with plants of group 3 (b) (above) are of the same order as would be expected in intraspecific crosses. 6. The hybrid plants obtained under 5 (above) are fertile and interbreed freely with one another and with plants of the parental species. 7. Seed produced by intercrossing plants of group 3(a) (above) with either L. italicum or L. perenne have a lower germinating capacity than seed produced in intraspecific crosses, but established progeny are easily produced in both cases. 8. The hybrid plants produced under 7 (above) are fertile and again produce fertile progeny amongst themselves and with the parental species. 9. The slight barrier that may exist between L. rigidum Gaud. on the one hand and L. italicum and L. perenne on the other does not preclude free interbreeding between all the wind-pollinating types of Lolium. 10. The non-annual habit is nominally dominant in all cases, but its expression varies according to the perenniality of the non-annual parent. 11. Segregation for both annual and non-annual habit and for plant type occurs in F2 and in backcrosses, but the backcross causes a strong swing-over towards the pure species parental type. 12. A very strong interbreeding barrier exists between the wind-pollinating annual Lolium types and the self-pollinating annual Lolium species. 13. This is mainly shown in poor caryopsis development and almost complete failure of the seed to germinate. © 1954 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008237047

Genetical and environmental influences are considered as problems of adaptation. Cold tolerance, susceptibility to smut, and fungi attacking ripening grain are under genetical control, but modified by environmental conditions. Analysis of these factors helps to control these diseases. Strains differ in resistance to frit fly attacks, and this is modified by sowing time. Frit flies and wireworms, acting independently or together, may limit sweet corn growing in some areas, while aphids also attack some inbred lines. Various methods of insect control are suggested. Mice and birds eat seeds, and bird damage may also limit maize growing. An outline suggests genetical and non-genetical modes of future control for diseases and insect pests when adaptating sweet corn to new climatic and other factors. These include selection for and use of resistant strains, or control by sowing at specific times. © 1954 Martinus Nijhoff.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250608071

In the present investigation, cytological studies on the F1 plants, raised from Triticum sphaerococcum and Secale sereale, was carried out. 2. 160 flowers on 10 spikes of T. sphaerococcum (n=21) were pollinated with the pollen of S. cereale (n=7), and 46 grains were obtained. From these grains 5 F1 plants were raised. The percentage of the raised individuals to the number of all the pollinated flowers was 3.13 per cent. 3. The external characters of F, plants seem to have resemblance to the parents, although much more closely to the mother plant (T. sphaerococcum) than the intermediate of the parents (Photo. 1 and Table 1).4. The number of somatic chromosomes of F1 plants counted to be 28 (Fig. 1) and it corresponds to the sum of the reduced chromosome numbers of the parents. 5. At first maturation division in PMCs of the F1 plants, 0~4 bivalents and 28~20 univalents were observed (Figs. 2~8). The frequency of bivalents in PMCs was shown in Table 2, and the case of zero in the number of bivalents appeared to be the mode. These bivalents seem to be derived from synthesis between A and B or among A, B and D genomes of T. sphaerococcum which is the mother plant. As there seems to be no homology between A, B, D genomes of T. sphaerococcum and R genome of S. cereale, synthesis will not occur between their chromosomes. 6. At ana-telophase in heterotypic division of PMCs, the chromosomes were distributed to the opposite poles from 14:14 to 27:1.7. The anther of these F1 plants was not opened and pollen grains showed almost sterile, but on rare occasions, some anthers were opened and consequently a few seed (5 grains) were obtained in natural selfing. From these 5 grains one F2 plant was raised. © 1953, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934059348

The conclusions of my work are the following I° - It has been proved that Salvia longistyla is a typical short-day plant and that its critical point of reaction lies approssimately on the 14 hours, when the average night-temperature is about 18°C; the flowering does not succeed if the night-temperature is decidedly below 15°C. II° - The plant' requires short-day conditions not only for the formation of the flower buds, but also for the subsequent development, i. e. the full bloom; consequently the plant belongs to Eguchi's S. S. class (short day-plant for both the manifestations). III. - Under natural conditions, in our latitude, Salvia longistyla flowers only in Autumn, because only in this season we have suitable photoperiod and concomitantly suitable night-temperature. In Spring, though the day is short, the night-temperature is not sufficiently high; in Winter and in Spring, the flowering is possible only in a warm green-house, with a night-temperature of about 18°C. In orange green-houses Salvia longistyla can continue the flowering begun in Autumn; during Winter and Spring new blooms do not succeed, just because the night-temperature, in such green houses, is never sufficiently high. IV. - We can obtain fruiting only by artificial pollination (lack of natural pollination agency). V. - The basal branches do not flower even in optimal photo- and termoperiodical conditions (which allow apical flowering) on acount of a mechanism of correlative inhibition. VI. - The elongation of the internodes is relatively inhibited at a very long photoperiod, differently from what we observe in most plants. These prerogatives, verified in repeated experiments, are in perfect accordance with the characteristics of the ambient in which the plant is naturally diffused (Mexico). The altitude and latitude of the stations in which the plant has usually been found, have a short photoperiod all year long, and temperatures (also night-temperatures) costantly suitable for a good growth and bloom. The plants, in the natural ambient, are perennial and bushy. The pluri-annuality can be referred to the flowering inhibition of the lateral and basal branches, that takes place in a specimen and that keeps on for a long time, also after the full flowering of the principal axis. The basal shoots show a tendency to the vegetative growth, even though the external conditions are suitable to the flowering of the apical parts of the plant. Therefore we must attribute the pluriannuality of S. longistyla to this correlative flower-inhibiting mechanism. © 1953, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958344569

The present work dealing with the residual antumn habit has been designed to obtain an information on the mechanism of this functional weakness in flowering from the physiological point of view. When winter barley variety is sown in spring, provided completely with the necessary conditions for cancellation of autumn habit by chilling for more than 30 days at 1°C before sowing, the flowering takes place normally, resulting in fewer occurrences of sterility. However, if the necessary conditions are not given sufficiently, that is, duration of chilling is in the range of 20 to 30 days, the flowering delays for about 2 weeks compared with that of the completely verbalized, and sterility occurs in considerably high percentage as shown in Fig. 1. [graph] Moreover, when the chilling period is shortened to less than 20 days, the plants sown in spring fail to reach ear formation in that season and the formation of leaves and tillers is extremely promoted without setting any flowers, the plants remaining the ""rosette"" stage. As seen from this rosette phenomenon, it will be obvious that vegetative growth and reproductive growth belong respectively to the essentially different phases in plant growth : The former includes the leaf growth and tillering, while the letter includes elongation of culm after the ear formation and the growth of spike. In the early stages, as the reproductive organs involving culm and eat have little, if any, ability to produce carbohydrates and other materials necessary for their growth in quantity by themselves, the materials employed for their growth are drawn from the vegetative organs consisting of leaves and roots. © 1953, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

In the restoration backcrosses to Ae. ovata the process of restoring the ovata genomes to the ovata plasma has been accomplished in the course of three successive crosses. The final offspring were morphologically similar to Ae. ovata, had 14 bivalents at first metaphase and normal anthers filled with functional, good pollen. In the substitution backcrosses of Aegilotricum to T. durum, the three successive crosses resulted in durum plants with ovata plasma. They had at first metaphase 14 completely paired bivalents; the tetrad formation was normal but later all pollen was degenerating, and the small dry anthers contained empty pollen. However, the female organs were fully functional and seed setting by artificial pollination with durum or dicoccum pollen was normal. The male sterility was transmitted to the next generation by the mother. Similar pollen degeneration was observed in normal T. durum which have matured in winter after vernalization and long-day treatments. It is further to be noticed that durum plants with ovata plasma having extra chromosomes of Ae. ovata as univalents in addition to the 14 duram bivalents were only partially male-sterile.

Heterozygous rough clones were used as sources of contaminating pollen and homozygous recessive smooth clones as testers. 4.2 In the clonal fields the cross pollination rapidly decreased over the first 3 to 4 rows and after that only slowly. Simultaneousness of flowering often had a greater effect on the percentage of crossing than vicinity. In spite of differences in flowering time of one week the clones were fertilized on an average for 40% by the two adjacent clones and for 74% by the three neighbours on both sides. 4.3 It was demonstrated that in unreplicated clonal fields the various clones are pollinated by genotypically different pollen mixtures, whereas in polycross fields a genotypical homogeneous pollination may be obtained. Polycrossed progenies, therefore, make possible a much more reliable testing of the genotype of the clones than open pollinated progenies. 4.4 In two polycross fields differences in flowering time of more than one week and differences in pollen production disturbed seriously the homogeneousness of the pollination. There is need for more experimental evidence upon which the proper design of a polycross field may be based. © 1952 Kluwer Academic Publisher.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011353627

In D. annulatum and D. caricosum a period of two days elapses between complete emergence of panicles out of the boots and the commencement of anthesis thus allowing sufficient time to self and treat number of panicles at a time. In B. intermedia anthesis and dehiscence take place as the panicles emerge out of the boots and thus it is necessary to bag or treat the panicles immediately three or four days after the appearance of flag-leaf. A period of 11 days in D. annulatum and D. caricosum and 9 days in B. intermedia is required from the appearance of flag leaf to completion of anthesis.

In 1944 hybrid maize plantings occupied approximately 83 % of the maize acreage in the Corn Belt. The increase in yield resulting from the use of hybrid maize was estimated at 669,480,000 bushels in 1943. The production of hybrid seed involves four separate steps: (1) development of inbred lines and testing of these in hybrid combinations, (2) multiplication of seed of the component lines, (3) seed production of the foundation single crosses, and (4) production of double?crossed seed used for commercial planting. The earlier methods used in maize improvement included mass selection, varietal hybridization and ear?to?row selections. These methods were of limited value and are now of interest largely from a historical standpoint. Inbred lines are developed by self?fertilization accompanied by selection. Selection is practised for the various characters which are expressions of vigour. Positive and significant correlations have been reported between yields of the hybrids and yield, plant height, ear length, ear diameter, shelling percentage, number of ears per plant, leaf area, brace roots and root volume of the inbred parents. The final evaluation of an inbred line is determined by its performance in hybrid combinations. The top?cross or inbred?variety cross is commonly used for the preliminary evaluation. Subsequently the more promising lines are tested in single?cross combinations. Evidence has been presented indicating that combining ability of inbred lines is heritable. In new lines isolated from single crosses, a greater proportion of high?yielding combinations are obtained when the component lines are derived from unrelated parentage. Single?cross performance data may be used to predict the performance of double?crossed combinations. The most efficient method of estimation is based on the average performance of the four non?parental single?cross combinations. The order of pairing of the four component lines of a double cross may have a marked effect on variability and yield. In general the highest yielding double crosses are those that combine single crosses differing most widely in parentage. In the direct inbreeding of open?pollinated varieties the great majority of lines are discarded after preliminary testing. The remaining lines produce desirable hybrids, and these are used as source material for a new cycle of inbreeding and testing. These cyclical repetitions of inbreeding and testing are designated as cumulative selection. Second generation seed is sometimes used as parent stock in crossing fields. If genetic identity has been maintained double?crossed seed produced from F2 or F3 advanced generation single?cross stocks will produce yields which are essentially similar to the same double crosses produced from F1 single crosses. The use of F2seed for commercial planting invariably results in rather large decreases in yield. Synthetic varieties are advanced generations of the open?pollinated seed mixtures of a number of inbred lines or of hybrids among them. When the component lines are selected on the basis of combining ability yields of the resulting synthetics approximate yields of standard double?crossed combinations. Several new methods of isolating and testing inbred lines are under investigation. All of these involve some aspect of cumulative selection or early testing. Early testing is based on two assumptions: first, that there are marked differences in combining ability among the plants of a population selected for inbreeding, and secondly, that a selected sample based on tests of combining ability of S0 plants provides a better sample for further inbreeding and selection than a more nearly random sample from the same population selected on visual appearance alone. Gametic selection, one aspect of early testing, is based on the assumption that if zygotes of a given combining ability occur with a frequency of 1 % then gametes having a corresponding combining ability should occur with a frequency of 10 %. The problem of identifying these superior gametes is discussed. Recurrent selection for specific combining ability involves selection for combining ability with a minimum of inbreeding. No experimental data are available to evaluate the method and possible advantages and limitations are presented. The general problem of heterosis is one of the most important problems in genetics at the present time. Various aspects of this problem are discussed. Recessive characters probably have little or no influence on heterosis. Data on growth rates have thrown some light on the amount of stimulation resulting from hybridization but have been of limited value in providing a physiological explanation of the nature of the stimulus involved. Convergent improvement studies indicate that the dominant genes from two lines may be concentrated in a single line by recurrent back pollination, accompanied by selection. The data available indicate that dominant favourable genes are more important in heterosis than physiological stimulation resulting from genetic diversity. Attempts to assess the relative importance of general and specific combining ability have little critical bearing on the heterosis problem at present. Inversions have been suggested as a possible tool for determining the chromosomal distribution of factors responsible for heterotic effects. Data are limited but suggest the method is feasible. Progress in the development of disease?resistant lines and hybrids is limited by the lack of suitable techniques for inducing epidemics at will. Information on resistance is reviewed briefly. Relatively little work has been done in developing inbred strains resistant to insect pests except in the case of the European cornborer. The results obtained indicate ample genetic variation for progress when an adequate infestation can be obtained. Maize varieties are extremely variable, and striking responses to selection have been reported. The Illinois selection experiments for high and low oil and high and low protein are the most notable. After 29 years of selection for high and low values respectively oil percentage had been changed from 4.68 to 9.86 and 1.51. The corresponding modification in protein percentage was from 10.93 to 16.60 and 4.68. Further results and opportunities in breeding for chemical composition are mentioned.

Figure 10C shows the head and an enlarged view of one of its lower spikelets; Figure 10A-B show heads and spikelets of Agropyron repens Beauv. and A. junceum Beauv. and Figure 10D-G those of a number of wheats for comparison. At first it was difficult to point out the characters so reminiscent of Agropyron, but reflection suggests that in the main they are the peculiarly straight sided glumes markedly V-shaped at the node. © 1946 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960567032

Monochoria hastfolia is a marshy plant. It has a subterranean root-stock and bears hastate leaves. The flowers show trimerous symmetry. Of the six stamens, one is larger and the anther is differently coloured. The pollen grains produced in this anther show no morphological or size-difference when compared to those produced in the other anthers. All are equally viable. 2. Anthesis of flowers takes place generally before 8 a.m. On cloudy and humid days it is delayed. Bagging of inflorescences shows that self-pollination is the rule. Seed formation takes place under natural conditions and it takes about 15 days for the seeds to develop after syngamy. The germination of the seed is of the ""Palm-type"". 3. The development of the microspore appears to be of the successive type. During heterotypic prophase the nucleolus becomes adpressed against the nuclear wall and assumes a lens-shaped structure. At this stage a distinct connection of the nucleolus with the spireme is first noted. At pachynema a small spherical body is seen to lie at the side of the nucleolus to which the spireme is connected. This has been referred to as the nucleolar body. At diakinesis a pair of bivalents are also seen to lie attached to the nucleolus. The haploid number of chromosome is 14. Cytokinesis takes place by cell plate formation. 4. The pollen grains have an elongated appearance when dry. The exine shows the presence of fine granulations all over the surface and has two furrows situated diametrically opposite to each other. The pollen grains are bi-nucleate at the time they are shed. The generative nucleus lies within a cytoplasmic sheath, the ends of which are drawn out. 5. The pollen grains germinate on the stigma within ten minutes after pollination. The pollen tubes pass through the stylar canals and the division of the generative nucleus takes place inside the pollen tube. The metaphase spindle is well organised. Furrows or cell plates have not been observed and it appears that the sperm-nuclei become separated by the disappearance of the spindle fibres. © 1942 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951507953

Such phenomenon is called &quot;pseudo-fertility&quot; and is explained on the basis that the special substance that inhibits the pollen germination is not yet produced when the flowers are premature. Sweet potato varieties are commonly known to be self-incompatible as well as cross-incompatible in certain matings, so there still remains much room for further investigation concerning the subject. If pseudo-fertility is easily induced in sweet potato, the breeding work of this crop may become more advantageous for obtaining seeds in voluntary matings. Desiring to throw some light on this line of experiment, the anthor had carried on a series of experiments in regard to chances and causes of this phenomenon since 1939 at Konosu Farm of the Imperial Agricultural Experiment Station. The varieties used for material, and methods of artificial inducement of blooming, pollination operations, measurements of pollen germination and pollen tube growth, etc., are the same as discribed in the previous paper (T0GARI and KAWAHARA: 1943). The following summary may be made from the results of these experiments: 1. There were no flower bearing self-fertilized seed in the bud-Pollination at 5 p.m. on the day before blooming. Similar observations were made in both compatible and incompatible matings when the young buds were pollinated with viable pollen (Tab. 1) The results indicate the difficulty to induce pseud-fertility by the application of prmnature pollination in sweet potato. In order to elucidate the mechanism of such phenomenon of failure in inducing pseudo-fertility, it is necessary to study pollen bebaviors. 2. Viable pollen failed to germinate in both compatible and incompatible pollinations one or two days before blooming (Tab. 2). Therefore, it may be concluded that the pollen receptivity, i. e., the ability to make pollen germinate on the stigma, does not yet arise at this time in the buds. It is thus necessary to study the stage when the pollen receptivity occurs. 3. Unopened buds in the course of development were pollinated with viable pollen at fourth hour intervals from 4 p.m. the day before blooming to the day of blooming. The compatible pollen was found to germinate for the first time in the pollination at 0 a.m. on the day of blooming (Tab. 3, 4). Consequently, it is not till several hours before blooming that the pollen receptivity occurs in stigma. 4. In incompatible matings, the germination when failure of pollen is always observed with exception of 0.2 percent germination when pollinated at 4 a.m. (Tab. 3, 4). These results lead the author to conclude that the peculiarity of prematnre pistil to compatibility and incompatibility with the occurence of pollen receptivity of stigma, is not different from the completed stage. 5. Since pollen cannot germinate until the pollen receptivity occurs in stigma and that the young stigma with the pollen receptivity behaves similar to the matured one in regard to compatibility and incompatibility, pseudo-fertility in sweet potato may be presumed to be presumed to be hardly induced by means of the bud-pollination. 6. The pistil behavior in question as well as the pollen receptivity mentioned above was found to arise when the ovary was removed two days before blooming (Fig. 1, Tab. 5, 6). From these observations, following presumption may be made: The function causing compatibility or incompatibility is either already generated in the stigma two days before blooming or arise independently of the ovary. In these respects, there is something peculiar about sweet potato that makes it distinguishable from Petunia in which pseudo-fertility mechanism was elucidated by Dr. YASUDA. © 1942, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

It is found that some of the leading commercial varieties are practically selfsterile, while others are inter-sterile; that is, some varieties are much better pollen-izers than others for orchard planting. Sometimes pollination works well in one direction, while the reciprocal cross produces very little fruit. It thus becomes necessary for cherry growers, particularly in regions where only a few varieties are produced, to study each individual variety and find out its needs in pollination, if they would avoid disaster. Inter-sterility among varieties is found not to be correlated to closeness of relationship. whom anything outside of his own orbit was of little consequence.

The present cxperiment was undertaken to get some information about the effect of overwintering of vines on the flowering and fruiting babit in sweet potato plant. Thirty varieties of Ipomoea Batatas Lam. were used as materials. On September 20th, healthy strong vines taken from our experiment field, were cut into pieces about 40 cm. long, and were transplanted in 27-cm. pots. These potted plants were transfered to the green house on November 25th, to be kept in it throughout the winter, and were shifted again to the field on April 25th. At that time, some of these vines were girdled, aslanting incision being made across the stem, at a distance of l0 cm. from the basal end. Fourteen varieties were induced to flowering as a sesult of overwintering of vines, of which nine set seeds by self-pollination. The amounts of carbohydrates such as starch and sugars were found markedly higher in the vines which had been induced to flower, while the moisture and nitrogen contents in those vines were much smaller than in the disbudded ones. In contrast to the non-flowering vines, the flowering ones had less active cambiums and somewhat deformed phloem cells, even though they produced many secondary-xylem elements. Thicker walls of the cells in the pericycle, xylem and phloem tissues were rather common in the flowering stems. The sensitivity of sweet potato plant to short-day treatment with 8- or 9-hour-daylength varied according to their age, some varieties being induced very readily to flower after overwintering of the plant.

The pollen influences the development of the fruit inasmuch as defective embryos promote earlier ripening and smaller fruits. Further, the wider the difference between the two parents, the more defective the embryos. The developmental differences in the fruit are an expression of different degrees of seed growth. In some varieties of pears frost injury to the styles induces parthenocarpy, i.e. the complete absence of embryo development. Difference in the fruit due to the action of the pollèn (formerly known as xenia) fall into three classes: (1) where the developing zygote is affected, (2) where the endosperm is affected, (3) where the effect is on the maternal tissues. In classes (1) and (2) the effects or differences are due to the action of paternal genes in heredity, and since they are readily explicable on a simple genetic basis there is no reason why they should continue to be referred to as xenia. In class (3) they are due to differences in the constitution and development of the embryo, endosperm and seed which affect the development of the maternal tissue.

Self-incompatibility in diploid pears is due to arrested pollen-tube growth. Three days after pollination the tubes are approximately one-third of the way down the style and their ends are swollen. 2. In a cross between two diploid varieties compatible and incompatible tubes are present indicating gametic determination of incompatibility. 3. The somatically doubled autotetraploid Fertility is self-fertile, but both compatible and incompatible tubes are present in selfed styles. Compatible tubes of the tetraploid grow faster than compatible tubes of diploids both in tetraploid and in diploid styles. 4. The breakdown of the self-sterility mechanism following chromosome doubling is reviewed and found to be of fairly widespread occurrence in plants. A working hypothesis to explain the effect of polyploidy on self-sterility is given: it is based on the assumption that S 1S 2 pollen is compatible and S 1S 1 and S 2S 2 pollen incompatible in S 1S 1S 2S 2 styles. 5. Pollen tubes of the diploid variety Beurré Bedford grow as fast as those of a tetraploid variety, penetrate the style and enter the embryosac; but only rarely do they effect fertilization. Beurré Bedford pollen grains are unreduced pollen mother cells with haploid, diploid, triploid, and tetraploid nuclei. The high rate of growth of the pollen tubes is due to the nature of the pollen cell and the failure to fertilize the eggs to the lack of balance between the sperm nuclens and the cell. 6.

The haploid was a reduced replica of the diploid plant with smaller leaves and flowers. It flowered at the same time as the diploid and after setting a good amount of seed under conditions of open-pollination died with the rest of its sister plants. The somatic chromosome number of the haploid was determined in meristematic cells of young leaves as 10 and that of the diploid as 20. A few cells with the diploid number of chromosomes were found scattered in the leaf tissue of the haploid. At meiosis, the haploid showed 10 univalents from diakinesis to anaphase I in each pollen mother cell, Occasionally, however, a loosely paired bivalent was noticed in some cells. At division I the univalents either segregated at random into two groups or collected to form an interphase nucleus. Division II in the former case produced tetrads of unequal spores, and in the latter dyads of equal spores. A few pollen mother cells with the diploid number of chromosomes were also noticed in the haploid ; these were seen to undergo normal meiosis producing tetrads with equal spores. As a result of dyad formation in a large number of haploid pollen mother cells and tetrad formation in the few diploid pollen mother cells, the pollen fertility of the haploid was found to be as high as about 60 per cent.

When long photoperiods were used during relatively short intervals in the life of the plants, they appeared to be most useful when the flowers were making their final development. Long photoperiods very early in the life of the plant were very useful for berry production, but were not indispensable and unless the long photoperiods were continued for 60 or 70 days they brought about the production of relatively few' berries. Berry production occurred with an 18-hour photoperiod, but production was only one-third as great as with a 24-hour photoperiod. No berries were developed by the very early strain (Triumph 12) with an 18-hour photoperiod and with this strain berries were produced with only four of the 24-hour photoperiod treatments. Our evidence indicates that induction of flowering in Triumph potatoes by using long photoperiods for short intervals of time is not feasible and except under very favorable conditions of high light intensity it is not possible. © 1941 Springer.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849173695

The fact that ovules frequently become disorganized, even when active pollen tubes are present, shows that degeneration is not due to lack of viable pollen. The process of fertilization in normal embryo-sacs is described. Fertilization is not a necessary preliminary to the formation of endosperm, and definite proof was obtained that embryos sometimes arise from unfertilized eggs. Seed which is apparently viable is not always capable of germination for reasons which are fully described. Forms of R. Ficmia with axillary tubercles appear to be almost absent from certain localities in Devonshire and Somerset, although there are districts in other parts of the country where they are dominant. In other places forms with or without aerial tubercles appear to exist side by side in about equal quantities.

With open pollination less than 0.02 per cent of the fully developed flowers set seed. All F1 eggs which functioned resulted from a process of restitution which was observed at both meiotic divisions of F1 During the process both the loss and duplication of chromosomes may occur so that the number in functioning eggs may vary slightly above or below the somatic number 28 (21 wheat + 7 rye), and the genic content may be quite variable. The second generation feil into 3 fairly equal groups with approximately 28, 42, and 49 chromosomes respectively. Both the chromosome behaviour and the genetical characters indicate that the 28-chromosome group originated through parthenogenetic development of F1 restituted eggs. In both respeets they are similar to F1, with such exceptions as would be due to the loss or duplication of chromosomes at restitution. Their occurrence supports the theory that amphidiploids may be due to parthenogenetic development of restituted eggs followed by chromosome doubling. Plants of the 42-chromosome group had only about 14 pairs at meiosis, exhibited characters of emmer wheats, and were very sterile.

Nitrogen starvation reduces the number of blossom?buds formed, the percentage of buds that open and the mean numbers of fruits per flower?truss. Potassium starvation does not affect the number of blossom?buds formed or the percentage of buds that open but reduces the mean numbers of fruits per flower?truss. An outstanding feature of nitrogen starvation is retardation of the rate of development of successive flower?trusses. With potassium starvation the rate of development is accelerated. Growth, estimated from increase in height of plants trimmed to a single axis by continuous removal of incipient axillary shoots, is retarded by both nitrogen and potassium starvation. The maturation period (between opening of the blossom and ripening of the fruit) is lengthened by potassium starvation, shortened by moderate nitrogen starvation and lengthened by severe nitrogen starvation. From the present results, in conjunction with data published previously, it is concluded that the maturation period is shortened by a high carbohydrate?nitrogen balance and lengthened by a low carbohydrate?nitrogen balance. In mid?season all plants suffer a check to growth and development demonstrated by (a) retardation of the rate of differentiation of leaves and flower?trusses, (b) cessation of growth in height, and (c) the occurrence of a high proportion of fruit with arrested development. This mid?seasonal check is accentuated by nitrogen and potassium starvation, especially the former, corresponds with the period of maximal weight of developing fruit, and is attributed to competition for nutrient supply between the fruits and vegetative parts of the plants, leading to apparent antagonism between these processes. The fruiting and foliage symptoms of the potassium?starved plants are attributed to the following effects: (a) The potassium in starved plants is undergoing a continuous cycle, being translocated from older parts of the plant to the growing point, incorporated in young leaves and flower trusses and subsequently re?translocated as these organs are approaching maturity. (b) The level of potassium supply regulates nitrogen metabolism, a moderately low potassium supply being associated with high protein level and a greater degree of seventy of potassium starvation with low protein level. The results are discussed in relation to the problems of overbearing and potassium manuring. The observed effects of potassium deficiency on fruiting (acceleration of development of flower trusses, failure of pollination and prolongation of the maturation period of the fruit) are those also associated with carbohydrate deficiency relative to nitrogen supply.

Gros Michel artificially pollinated by Robusta, both triploid parthenocarpic varieties of Musa, yielded fifteen F1 plants of which fourteen are tetraploid and one triploid. The somatic chromosomes of these are described and compared with those of the parents. It is argued that the tetraploid F1's are derived from triploid Gros Michel eggs and haploid Robusta pollen. 2. The F1 back-crossed with the male parent gave progeny with somatic chromosome numbers ranging from 32 to 44 including triploids, tetraploids and aneuploids. These are thought to have arisen from eggs with chromosome numbers ranging from 21 to 33 fertilised by haploid Robusta pollen. 3. The F1 back-crossed to the female parent gave triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids, one heptaploid and aneuploids. These seedlings it is argued arose from either triploid or diploid Gros Michel eggs fertilised by F1 pollen ranging in chromosome number from 11 to 22. The heptaploid was probably formed from an egg with a doubled chromosome complement (66). 4. The only F2 plant proved to be an aneuploid with 34 somatic chromosomes. 5. The foregoing conclusions are supported by a statistical analysis of pollen grain size in the parents and F1, based on the assumption that that size varies as the pollen chromosome number. 6. Discrepancies, such as the absence of hexaploid seedlings in the back-cross to Gros Michel, are attributed to the selective action of differential pollen tube growth. © 1935 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951516306

In result of our investigations of diploid-hexaploid and octoploid-hexaploid hybrids, we have found 16 cases of doubling of the chromosome number in sexual cells of hybrids, and 5 cases of doubling in pure species. A cytological analysis of all F2 hybrids at our disposal (the number of chromosomes has been counted in 14 plants out of 25), as well as of back crosses (the number of chromosomes has been counted in 2 plants out of 6), will doubtless considerably increase this number. The differences in the chromosome sets (7 chromosomes being a whole set) of the species used in crossing, evidently, greatly promotes the above mentioned phenomenon. Starting from experimental data, there may be two ways of explaining the origin of the polyploid series of Fragaria, with 14, 28, 42, 56 somatic chromosomes, found under natural conditions. The first way is that of hybridisation, as a source of origin of polyploid species, (with different chromosome sets) with subsequent doubling of the chromosome number, giving rise to allopolyploids. In regards to the second way, cross pollination is but an external stimulating influence, similar to a series of other factors disturbing the normal course of reduction division, and giving rise to autopolyploids (analogous to the origin of our tetraploid). It is evident, that high polyploid species of the strawberry have originated in the first way. © 1934 Martinus Nijhoff.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009604852

It has been found, therefore, of increasing importance to make botanical surveys of the patients' environment, including the plant distribution and pollen production as well as the sensitivity of the patients. Many such studies have been made throughout the United States and Europe. Blackley's studies, published in 1873 and 1880, are outstanding pieces of research on hay fever. To Blackley belongs the credit for the method of pollen determination now still in use and also the method of cutaneous testing for the sensitivity of patients. Scheppegrell in 1917 devised a formula for the determination of the pollen content of the air, in grains per cubic yard, and this has been used by many investigators, but, because ragweed pollen is the chief cause of hay fever, practically all the reports thus far published have stressed the ragweed pollen content of the air. Since no reports were available regarding the wind-borne pollens of the Rocky Mountain region, I made botanical and air analysis studies in 1928, 1929, and 1930. Six test plots were chosen in which flora representative of the entire intermountain states was found; that is, alkali flat, desert, swamp, canyon, farming land, and high-grade residence property. From the results (Table I) it was evident that ragweed was neither the most abundant plant in the region nor the chief cause of hay fever as determined by cutaneous tests on hay fever patients. A total atmospheric pollen survey of Utah as a typical intermountain state was undertaken, therefore, rather than merely a ragweed survey. Pollen counting stations were established in four Utah towns. The results were graphed (Chart 1) and showed that the peaks of pollination fell in late July and early August when the grasses were beginning to wane and the weeds reached their maximum. Secondary peaks occurred in September when the sages pollinate. The total pollen production was estimated for the plants found (Table II). The most important anemophilous plants of this region proved to be as follows: (1) Graminaceae. (2) Chenopodiaceae-Russian thistle, salt bush, summer cypress. (3) Artemisia-sages. (4) Ambrosiaceae-ragweed. From cutaneous tests on 1,801 hay fever patients in this area, it was determined that 54.4 per cent of them reacted to the pollen of Russian thistle, 33.7 per cent to sagebrush and 31.4 per cent to common ragweed (Table III). The pollen abundance and the reactions of patients were compared, as below. {A table is presented}. A scratch reaction of 1:5,000 histamine was used as a positive control and no reactions from cutaneous scratch tests smaller than the histamine wheal were regarded as positive. Scrub oak was proved to have low toxicity. The box elder in spite of low abundance and pollen production accounted for 21.1 per cent of the patients. The fact that ragweed is not so important a factor in the hay fever of this region is due to its low distribution. The sensitivity tests on patients are shown in Table IV which demonstrates the high percentage of patients sensitive to more than one pollen and the low percentage of those whose hay fever is due to a single pollen. There is a considerably higher percentage sensitive to weed pollen than to tree or grass pollen, while nearly a third are sensitive to more than one group. In connection with this work an incidental study was carried on with regard to the effect of travel on hay fever symptoms. Pollen counts were made on vehicles of various types to determine the amount of pollen entrapped on petrolatum-coated slides. All counts were equated to a twenty-four-hour basis for purposes of comparison. Using the counts obtained in Salt Lake City as unity the following ratios for pollen concentration were obtained: {A table is presented}. © 1934.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344248081

The work was done in central Arizona, where the pollinating season is nine months long, and climatic conditions favor the anemophilous plants. The technic of injection and the method of determining the proper dose for each individual at each treatment are described. More than 91 per cent of the patients, in 93 per cent of the seasons, obtained satisfactory results. Relief, when obtained, was prompt, usually occurring at or before the end of seven days of intensive treatment. There were 12 general reactions, distributed among 9 patients; a proportion of one general reaction in 45 seasons, or one to each 625 doses. Only two were severe; none was fatal. The few permanent skin blemishes seen were caused either by scratching, or by the intolerance of certain skins to the glycerin in the injected solutions. Intradermal pollen therapy offers an effective method for the relief of hay fever and pollen asthma during the attack. Its successful use requires the utmost nicety of technic, a practiced judgment of dosage, and an accurate knowledge of the local pollen picture. Its special advantages are the low dosage required, the low cost to the patient, and the promptness with which relief occurs. The phenomenon of almost immediate relief, which in certain cases follows one of the first intradermal injections, merits further investigation. © 1933.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50249193362

Self-fertilisation of self-sterile types of Petunia violacea was accomplished by the method of bud-pollination. 2. A series of four multiple allelomorphs for self-sterility was established as a result of the examination of (a) two selfed families and (b) F1 and F2 of crosses between homozygous types. 3. Two families proved unsuitable for genetic analysis probably owing to the segregation of minor factors for self-fertility. 4. The homozygous type S2S2 was lethal; S1S1 was dwarfed with curled leaves; S3S3 and S4S4 were normal in appearance but weak. 5. The phenomenon of hybrid vigour in relation to the selective advantage of heterozygotes against homozygotes is discussed and it is concluded that the hypothesis of superior vigour and selection value of the heterozygote phase of growth factors provides an adequate explanation of heterosis which is not inconsistent with the hypothesis of linked growth factors put forward by Jones. © 1933 Martinus Nijhoff.,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250583009

The haploid plant shows seven univalents in 80% of the pollen mother- cells, and various bivalent, trivalent and quadrivalent configurations of chromosomes in the renaining 20°/o of cells. Corresponding multivalents have been seen in the diploid. The associations of chromosomes in the haploid prove the presence of reduplicated segments in the chromosome complement. In one case, the reduplicated segment is terminal in one chromesome and interstitial in the other. The unequal configuration produced proves that chiasma formation is associated with and is a direct result of cytological crossing-over; such a configuration would lead to reduplication of end segments. The significance of the reduplications in relation to segmental interchange, translocation and the origin of a self-perpetuating ring- mechanism is discussed. Proofs of various other principles are given, including (i) the random segregation of chromosomes at anaphase I in the haploid, (ii) the disturbance in the random distribution caused by lagging of chromosomes and subsequent formation of restitution nuclei, (iii) terminalisation of chiasmata in the diploid, (iv) random occurrence of chiasma failure in the diploid. The arrest of terminalisation, due to a change in the linear homologies of the chromosomes, is clearly established by the pairing phenomena in the haploid. © 1932, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

The Salt River Valley, of which Phoenix is the central point, is taken as a type of the irrigated valleys. Its climatic conditions favor wind-pollinated plants. Species which for the most part are peculiar to the Southwest cause the hay fever and pollen asthma which are prevalent throughout most of the year. In this valley the cottonwood, ash, and olive trees cause mild symptoms in February, March, and April, respectively. Bermuda grass blooms from April 1 to late November, causing intense symptoms. There is no true ragweed in the valley, but members of an allied genus, Franseria, cause two ragweed seasons: the first, in March and April, from the desert franserias; the second, in September and October, from the false ragweed. Various species of Chenopodiales, including careless weed and Russian thistle, cause weed hay fever in summer; careless weed blooms in protected places most of the year. Visitors who are sensitized to the eastern ragweeds are not affected by the franserias unless they are group sensitized. Newcomers who had grass hay fever in the East do not react to the pollen of Bermuda grass until after several years of exposure. Visitors sensitive to pigweed or Russian thistle are not annoyed by pollen of the local species in winter, but they are liable to have symptoms in their first summer. All such group reactors are promptly relieved by intradermal treatment with extracts of the appropriate local pollens. In the mountain towns the hay fever season is relatively brief. Amaranth and Russian thistle in early summer, six-weeks grasses and false ragweed in late summer, account for nearly all cases. Only such visitors as have group sensitization or previous adequate exposure to local pollens are affected. In the resorts located in the pine forest and remote from cultivation, no pollen disease occurs. © 1932.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-10244271368

(somatic chromosome number 22), results in formation of occasional seeds, the average seed production being less than one per hundred flowers. Of ten plants raised from such seeds and examined cytologically, eight have 44 somatic chromosomes and two about 75. The former resemble their female parent, and have parthenocarpic fruits but an increased pollen fertility; the latter are thick-leaved, dwarf, and apparently sterile. Of five plants, forming an F2 generation from one of the 44-chromosome F1 individuals, three have 44 somatic chromosomes, and two have 46. The F1 crosses back to its female parent only with extreme difficulty, but crosses readily with its male parent, giving vigorous progeny with 33 somatic chromosomes. The course of events suggests that the basic haploid chromosome number in this series is eleven. The meiotic phenomena are not inconsistent with that hypothesis, but they further suggest that the eleven is a secondary haploid number, possibly derived from an original eight. © 1932, Indian Academy of Sciences.

The repeated self-pollination, which is an integral part of the breeding procedure, serves to reveal in a most striking way the heterogeneous make-up of maize varieties. Characters which are rarely or never observed in open pollinated stocks come to light in large numbers in the inbred lines. The greater proportion of these are recessives which doubtless have existed in the open pollinated stock for many generations shielded by their respective dominant allelomorphs. It is known that from time to time, however, new characters arise by mutation. These likewise are nearly always recessive in behavior. The occurrence of a dominant mutation is, in fact, a rare event. To the corn breeder the abnormalities cropping out in large numbers in inbred lines and the occasional ones arising by mutation are things to be gotten rid of. They more or less profoundly interfere with the development of the plant and limit its productivity. The student of heredity on the other hand, finds in these clear-cut characters just the materials he needs in analysing the genetic composition of the corn plant. Having once determined the position in the chromosomes of the gene governing a character, the latter may be used henceforth to mark the region involved. The maps which are thus constructed form an important part of the geneticist's analytical equipment. Their usefulness is closely related to their degree of completeness. In corn there are still long regions in the chromosomes without genetic labels. Further linkage studies are required to narrow these gaps and provide the basis for a closer analysis of the various hereditary phenomena encountered in the plant. © 1931 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962993088

The appearance of the plants with one less chromosome than the complete tetraploid or triploid set is attributed to the irregular meiotic divisions in the tetraploid mother plant.

The plants were divided into blocks and randomised, the flowers being harvested from a dozen plants each week over a period of 81/2 weeks, the flower heads ranged from the small bud stage in the first week to the overblown stage in the last week. The categories into which the flowers were divided to indicate maturity are defined and illustrated. The yield in numbers and weight of heads per plant, the diameters of the receptacles and the content of pyrethrin I and II were determined. There was a considerable amount of variation in all these factors in the flowers from different plants. A statistical analysis showed in this experiment: That there was no significant variation in the numbers of the flowers with time, but that position of the plant in the bed had a significant effect. That the time of harvesting had a significant effect upon the content of the pyrethrins whether taken separately or together and whether expressed in percentages, parts per flower head or parts per plant. The effect due to? position was only definitely significant in the case of pyrethrin I when expressed in parts per flower head. That there was on the different dates a significant correlation between the contents of pyrethrin I and II expressed in parts per flower head or plant. That there was, for the blocks of material examined, a significant correlation between the contents of pyrethrin I and II, whether expressed in percentages, parts?per head or parts per plant, but that owing to the heterogeneity of the material the correlation was only significant for individual plants when the pyrethrias were expressed in parts per plant. The data in this experiment indicate that for the material examined, there is a quantitative development of the active principles in the flower heads from the small bud stage up to the time of maturity of the flowers, which more than keeps pace on the whole with the increase in weight of the flowers. Thus the content of pyrethrins, both relatively and absolutely, rises to a maximum at the maturity of the flowers. The mean percentage content of pyrethrins fell after pollination and the fading of the flowers; this corresponds with the rapid increase in weight of the heads on the formation of seed. There would thus appear to be a loss, which might be serious, both in percentage content of active principles and in yield of flowers if harvested before being fully open. There seems to be no useful purpose served in leaving the flowers to the overblown condition. I wish to express my great indebtedness to Dr R. A. Fisher and Dr J.

Such studies have shown that the pollen contamination of the air is not as complex as is commonly supposed. It is pointed out that not a few individuals suffering from hay fever show a positive skin reaction to pollens which are not found in the air apart from that in close proximity to the flowers concerned. It follows, therefore, that skin tests alone are not necessarily a reliable guide in determining the pollens to be used for specific therapy in any individual case. Skin tests should be interpreted in the light of studies of the pollen content of the air as reported in this paper. The technic for such a study is outlined, and the general characteristics of the various pollen grains are described. The results of observations in Toronto are recorded. In the tree season the pollen of maple, elm, oak, and birch seem to be more important than that of other species. Of the grasses, timothy, red top, June grass, and orchard grass appear to cause practically all the hay fever during their pollination season. In the autumn type ragweed is recovered almost inclusively, and it would seem logical from this observation and for reasons mentioned earlier in this paper to blame this plant for the vast amount of suffering from hay fever and hay asthma during August and September. It would appear reasonable to simplify the specific treatment of the various types of hay fever in accordance with the findings recorded above. © 1930.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548004679

The glycerin saturated sodium chlorid solution method 'of extracting pollens gives a more potent preparation, both for. testing and for treatment, than the 12 per cent alcoholic normal saline extract. 4. More intensive treatment by use of more potent pollen extracts, giving of more frequent doses, and a larger final dose, gives better end results in hay fever treatments. 5.

It is pointed out that the consensus of opinion is in favour of the pollinating agent being small insects, either thrips, aphides or ants. Direct proof of natural crossing was obtained by examination of flowers on a male sterile tree, in which 9 per cent. of the flowers were found to be pollinated. Daily examination of flowers artificially pollinated, flowers attended by ants and aphides, and flowers with no attendant insects, indicated that the majority of cacao flowers are never pollinated under Trinidad conditions. Adequate pollination took place in 35 per cent. of flowers attended by ants and aphides, and is only 6 per cent of the controls. It is concluded that ants and aphides are the chief pollinating agents in the field under examination. Elimination of crawling insects demonstrated the presence of another pollinating agent, probably a night flying insect which pollinated about 1 per cent. of flowers.

This cross was made by Mr. F. W. Savage, plant breeder, acting under the direction of the senior author. From the grapefruit resulting from this cross, sixty seeds were obtained. Two of the resulting seedlings have fruited out at Eustis showing hybrid character with no points of especial promise. To distinguish this hybrid from the first cross of tangerine and grapefruit, the combination is designated a tangelolo (from tangelo and pomelo), but popularly this fruit should be classed with the tangelos. The freeze of 1917 destroyed most of the original seedlings and buds of this hybrid at Eustis, but one bud (Crop Physiology and Breeding No. 47, 220) which was inserted in March 1914 on an old sour orange tree, and which survived, bore fruit during the season of 1918. The first fruits were picked November 6 and sent in to Washington for examination. About four dozen fruits were borne on one branch the first season, four years from time of budding. © 1921, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957215135

In all naturally fertile varieties of orange trees, self-pollination is the rule and cross-pollination unnecessary. 2. Viable pollen is either wanting or very scarce in parthenocarpic varietiesi.e., varieties which produce fruit without seeds; the navel orange, for example. 3. The time required for complete fertilization after pollination varies with the variety from thirty hours in the Satsuma orange to four weeks in the wild Citrus trifoliata. 4. Normal embryo sacs are occasionally produced in the Washington Navel and Satsuma oranges. If such oranges happen to be pollinated with viable pollen from a nearby fertile variety, the result is the production of a few seeds in a navel orange. In other cases, even if pollination should take place, no seeds are produced because the embryo sacs in the navel orange disintegrate. In other words, navel oranges are seedless in most cases merely because they are not effectively pollinated and yet are able to produce fruit without such pollination. © 1915 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960607377

These flowers were on seven heads, each head containing twenty flowers. Two flowers, the first and second, were left in each spikelet, the upper flowers being removed by pinching off the rachilla above the second flower. Five spikelets were left on either side of the rachis, making a total of ten spikelets for each head. The spikelets left were the lower ones of the head, the upper spikelets being removed by cutting off the rachis above the tenth spikelet. The remaining flowers of the ten spikelets were emasculated in the usual way. The flowers were not artificially pollinated and the heads were not covered or protected in any way. At the end of the season the heads were harvested, the grains from each head being threshed out and counted. It was found that out of the total of 140 flowers emasculated, 112, or 80% had set seed. It has been the writer's practice always to cover and protect the heads worked with after emasculation and after pollination to avoid the possibility of foreign pollen pollinating the stigma before the desired poiien was applied artificially and fertilization had resulted. This test was made for the purpose of determining whether there is any possibility of the emasculated flower becoming pollinated if left unprotected before pollination. Simultaneous with this trial another was made, in which a number of flowers were emasculated and were covered but were not pollinated. © 1915 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957210034

Early botanists indeed were considerably puzzled by the case. Patrick Blair guessed that the honey absorbed the pollen and thus fertilized the ovary; Pontedera thought it kept the ovary in a moist condition: Linnaeus gave it up; Krunitz thought he observed that in meadows much frequented by bees the plants were more healthy, but the inference he drew was, that the honey, unless removed, was very injurious, and that the bees were of use in carrying it off. But since the cross-pollination of plants, and the part that insects play in it, have been understood, there has been little doubt as to the utility of nectaries in most flowers © 1915 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960615181

In general, it may be said that the internal changes are very complicated but the external changes quite simple. The process can be easily followed in the accompanying illustrations, made from Japanese flowercherries (Prunus pseudo-cerasus) and Japanese apricots (Frunus mumme) and considerably enlarged. Starting with the flower, as shown in Figure 8, we notice first of all the beautiful pink petals. These represent the expenditure of an immense amount of energy on the part of the tree, and yet have no direct connection with the production of seedswhich may be said to be the trees main purpose in life. When the ground below the tree is wholly carpeted with fallen petals, it may look as if the amount of energy thus used was wasted, but as a matter of fact the petals have served their purpose, and nearly every one knows that their purpose is a very useful one that of attracting insects to the flowers, and thus securing cross-pollination of the blossoms, in order that two lines of ancestry may be united in the seed, and the resulting plant thus benefit from the traits of two parents. After the petals have fulfilled their end in attracting bees to the flower, they are of no further use to the tree, and are dropped. The other conspicuous parts of the flower are the stamens or pollenbearing organs, and the style, an organ designed to catch pollen carried either by wind or insects and transmit it to the ovule lying in the ovary below. It is not necessary here to follow out the details of this process of pollination most readers understand how the pollen grain sends a long tube into the style and down to the ovary, and how the cell-nuclei of the pollen grain slip down this tube and unite with the 278 ovule. There are then two pairs of cell-nuclei; one pair unites to form the embryo, and the other to form what is known as the endospermthe starchy material surrounding the actual germ. This union of the male and female cellswhat the genetists call zygosis not only starts a complicated series of cell divisions in the ovule, leading to the production of the seed, but also stimulates the remaining parts of the flower to renewed growth. The stamens, whose function is finished after they have shed their pollen, wither and drop off in time. © 1915 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960590273

Colors and odors attract the attention of insects, however, the absence of either will not necessarily cause a flower to be neglected if it contains an ample supply of pollen and nectar. The absence of either may result in the flower being discovered much later by insects. Experiments do not give any evidence that bees visit flowers for experiencing an aesthetic pleasure. Insects, especially bees, occasionally examine the neglected, conspicuous flowers of cultivation, but if there is no food material, they do not repeat their visits. The introduction of an odorless syrup into conspicuous flowers induces insects to visit in large numbers. Color is not brought into competition with odor, the latter is invariably given the advantage. Bees are largely guided by past experience.

The cause of such a result is wholly unknown at present. The old hypothesis which sought an explanation of the deleterious effects of inbreeding in the inharmonious or unbalanced constitution produced by the accumulation of disadvantageous individual variations, can hardly stand in the face of the fact that a very large number of plants normally self-fertilize and a noteworthy few have even given up sexual reproduction entirely, without in the least degree lessening their physiological vigor and evident chances of success in competition with sexually produced plants. The dandelion is propagated parthenogenetically, i. e., its seeds are produced without fertilization, but only the advocate of an unwarrantable theory will maintain that this plant is on that account undergoing a process of deterioration which threatens it with summary extinction. Many species of violets produce most of their seeds from flowers that never open, and one of the most vigorous forms of the small-petaled evening primrose (Oenothera cruciata) does the same. In the breeding of tobacco, it is now well known that cross pollination within the limits of a single strain produces inferior offspring and only self-fertilization gives offspring of the highest degree of vigor, though hybrids between distinct strains of tobacco often display a vigor superior to that of either parental strain.

Many advocate detasseling the suckers but no one has demonstrated the advisability of so doing. The experiment was begun in 1903 by planting seed from one ear of Blount Prolific, a white dent variety that produces from one to four ears per stalk. This prolific variety was chosen so that several ears could be obtained from the same mother plant, thus overcoming to some degree the variation of individuals regarding production. The experiment was conducted by means of hand-pollinated ears, notes being kept of the characters of the two parents of each hand-pollinated ear. © 1906 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960550706
